0,0,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks at the National Christmas Tree Lighting,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-christmas-tree-lighting,"[<p>THE PRESIDENT: My name is Joe Biden. I am Jill Biden's husband. (Laughter.) On behalf of Jill and Kamala and Doug, we welcome you to the National Christmas Tree Lighting.</p>, <p>Thanks to the Interior Secretary, Deb Haaland, for that introduction and her leadership. She has made me look awful good in my judgments. It is wonderful to join you here on your birthday, Madam Secretary. Happy birthday. (Applause.)</p>, <p>Also thanks to the National Parks Service and Foundation that takes such great care of our national parks, and the 1,300 students around the country who created the ornaments that decorate the trees representing our states and our territories.</p>, <p>And a special thanks to tonight's host, LL Cool J. (Applause.) I'll tell you what, man, he looks like he can still play. And I'm not talking about instruments; I'm talking about football or something. The man is -- you know, anyway, I tell you what. (Laughter.)</p>, <p>But tonight's world-renowned performers were just wonderful to sit there and listen to you and hear you and watch you.</p>, <p>Over the course of the past 99 years, Presidents have continued this great America tradition of lighting the National Christmas Tree through war and peace, struggle and progress.</p>, <p>You know, for the evergreen tree -- it reminds us that even in the coldest, darkest days of winter that life and abundance will return.</p>, <p>It's a bright beacon of hope that reminds us of the promise we find in scripture of finding light in the darkness, which is also a very American thing to do -- perhaps the most American of things: to find light. And it's important to continue traditions like this one to remember that simple truth today.</p>, <p>For all those lost during this pandemic, we have also seen how much there is to gain -- the appreciation and gratitude of the gift of time and the light of goodwill that we share as we look out for one another.</p>, <p>Jill and I are especially grateful to our service members and their families and for their sacrifices to our nation.</p>, <p>We also -- we also keep in our hearts those who lost a loved ones because of this virus or any other cruel twist of fate or accident. We pray for them to find strength from sorrow, purpose from pain.</p>, <p>And as we look out across the country with the promise of a new year ahead, we know this:We are a great nation because you –- the American people. You are a good people. And because of you, we will never been more optimistic about the future. You've made me so optimistic I can't -- I tell you what, we're -- we have so much ahead of us.</p>, <p>As we enter this holiday season, in my Catholic faith, I think there's a prayer attributed to St. Francis. It says: Where there is hatred, let there be to sow love; where there is discord, union; where there is doubt, faith; and where there is darkness, light. And that's what we do. That's who we are. That's what the United States of America is all about.</p>, <p>So, Merry Christmas, America. May God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. (Applause.)</p>]"
0,1,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks on the COVID-19 Winter Plan and an Exchange with Reporters in Bethesda, Maryland",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-covid-19-winter-plan-and-exchange-with-reporters-bethesda-maryland,"[<p>THE PRESIDENT: Please, if there's any audience -- if there's any audience in the world I should be standing for, it's you -- not you standing for me. But thank you very much.</p>, <p>Good afternoon.</p>, <p>You know, in February, I came out here to the National Institutes of Health –- NIH –- and to our Vaccine Research Center to thank all of you -- the world-class doctors, scientists, researchers -- for the incredible work you've done during the pandemic and developing the vaccines, saving lives, giving us hope, also -- also continuing to give me advice on developments as they occur.</p>, <p>I've seen more -- (laughs) -- of Dr. Fauci than my wife. We kid each other, but -- (laughter) -- they look -- who's President? Fauci. (Laughter.)</p>, <p>But all kidding aside, I sincerely mean it.</p>, <p>Today, I'm back to announce our action plan to battle COVID-19 this winter -- not that any of it is a surprise to any of you because it's the combined advice from all of you that we developed this plan. And it doesn't include shutdowns or lockdowns but widespread vaccinations and boosters and testing and a lot more.</p>, <p>There are five key actions that I want to see us take this winter.</p>, <p>First of all -- first is expanding the nationwide booster campaign with more outreach, more appointments, more hours, more times and sites to walk in, providing boosters shots for up to 110 [100] million Americans who are eligible for boosters.</p>, <p>And I want to note, parenthetically, I was talking to one of my folks who does polling and national strategy. And he said there is some evidence in one poll -- I won't mention it because I'm not positive of the number -- I was told this as I was leaving the White House -- that there is an expectation that 30 percent of the non-vaxers that are ""no circumstances would I get a vaccination"" -- because of the new variant -- are now saying, ""I'm going to get a vaccination."" So, we hope that's true. I hope that's true.</p>, <p>But the second point is that -- launching new family vaccination clinics to make it easier for children, parents, and whole families to get vaccinated in one place, and new policies to keep our children in school instead of quarantining them at home. I'll talk about the detail of each of these in a moment.</p>, <p>The third piece of this is making free at-home tests more available than ever before and having them covered by your private insurance plans, available in thousands of locations, and available at community health centers and other sites for the uninsured who don't have insurance.</p>, <p>Four, increasing our ""Surge Response Teams"" that our -- our doctors, our nurses -- I know the people in this audience know incredibly well about what a surge team is but -- medical staff into communities with rising cases and overburdened hospitals and -- short on personnel.</p>, <p>And by the way, they make a gigantic difference. The governors -- Republican governors as well as Democratic governors contact me when I go into their states, talk about ""thank you for these surge teams"" because it really makes a difference in some -- some communities are hit so much harder than others. They just -- you know, they -- they just can't make it without what we're going to -- I'll speak to this in more detail in a second.</p>, <p>The fifth thing we're doing -- we're going to accelerate our efforts to vaccinate the rest of the world and strengthening -- strengthen the international travel rules for people coming to the United States.</p>, <p>I plan to announce -- my plan that I'm announcing today pulls no punches in the fight against COVID-19. And it's a plan that I think should unite us.</p>, <p>I know COVID-19 has been very divisive in this country. It's become a political issue, which is a sad, sad commentary. It shouldn't be, but it has been.</p>, <p>Now as we move into the winter and face the challenge of this new variant, this is a moment we can put this divisiveness behind us, I hope.</p>, <p>This is a moment we can do what we haven't been able to do enough of through this whole pandemic: get the nation to come together, unite the nation in a common purpose to fight this virus, to protect one another, to protect our economic recovery, and to think of it in terms of literally a patriotic responsibility rather than a -- somehow you're denying people their basic rights.</p>, <p>The plan I'm announcing today is a plan our scientists and COVID teams have recommended.</p>, <p>And while my existing federal vaccination requirements are being reviewed by the courts, this plan does not expand or add to those mandates -- a plan that all Americans, hopefully, can rally around.</p>, <p>And it should be -- and should get bipartisan support, in my humble opinion. And it should unite us, not continue to separate us.</p>, <p>Parenthetically, you all know that there are literally -- as it relates to whether or not we're going to pay the federal debt, whether we're going to in fact have a continued resolution, et cetera -- some of my friends on the other team are arguing that if I don't commit that there will never be any more mandates, they're going to let us default.</p>, <p>In the neighborhood I came from in Claymont, they'd look at me and say, ""Go figure. Go figure.""</p>, <p>But before I explain each new action in more detail, I want to -- and I'm not going to embarrass you, Doc -- but I want to thank Francis Collins.</p>, <p>You know, you've done an incredible job, Doc, here at NIH -- one of the most important scientists of our time, in my view.</p>, <p>No, I'm not being solicitous. I think I'm not exaggerating a bit.</p>, <p>After I was elected President, Dr. Collins was one of the first calls -- I think you were the second call I made -- to ask you if you'd stay on -- the second call I made.</p>, <p>It's because when I was Vice President I got to know Dr. Collins really well when I was given the opportunity to manage the Cancer Moonshot initiative.</p>, <p>And Dr. Collins is an incredible resource for our nation.</p>, <p>And I'm grateful -- and I mean this sincerely -- I'm grateful for everything he's done in this pan- -- for this pandemic and advancing all kinds of medical breakthroughs, including mapping the human genome.</p>, <p>He recently announced he is going to step down as director of NIH this month after a truly consequential tenure.</p>, <p>But the good news really is Dr. Collins is going to return to the lab -- the National Human -- (laughs) -- Genome Research Institute. And we look forward to his unmatched ability to unlock possibilities that are within our reach.</p>, <p>And, Doc, the bad news for you is you ain't getting rid of me, man. I'm going to keep calling you all the time because there's a lot of other things we can do -- you can do and help me to get done. You just tell me -- point me in the direction and I'll follow.</p>, <p>I just received a briefing from Dr. Collins and Fauci and Dr. Lawrence Tabak, as well as Dr. Julie Ledgerwood, and I appreciate it very much. My only regret was it was a short meeting so I was -- because I was -- come and speak. I think we would all benefit more if had made my speech short and spent more time with these docs.</p>, <p>But, you know, as they -- they study the Omicron variant just -- that we have just two cases reported here in the United States.</p>, <p>But, as I explained on Monday, this new variant is cause for concern but not panic.</p>, <p>We know there'd be ca- -- we knew there'd be cases of this -- of Omicron here in the United States, and it's here. But we have the best tools -- the best vaccines in the world and the best medicine and the best scientists in the world.</p>, <p>We're going to fight this variant with science and speed, not chaos and confusion, just like we beat back COVID-19 in the spring and more powerful variant -- Delta variant in the summer and fall.</p>, <p>As a result, we enter this winter from a position of strength compared to where America was last winter.</p>, <p>Last Christmas, fewer than 1 percent of American adults were fully vaccinated. This Christmas, that number will be 77 -- 72 percent, including more than 86 percent of seniors -- the most vulnerable population</p>, <p>Last Christmas, our children were at risk without a COVID-19 vaccine. This Christmas, we have safe, effective vaccines</p>, <p>for children age five and older, with 20 million children and counting now vaccinated.</p>, <p>Last year, a majority of our schools were closed Christmastime in that area. Now over 99 percent of our schools are open.</p>, <p>But I've pledged to always be straight and give it to you straight from the shoulder as President of the United States and tell the American people exactly where we are.</p>, <p>So, here -- here it is: Experts say that COVID-19 cases will continue to rise in the weeks ahead in this winter, so we need to be ready.</p>, <p>You can read the whole plan we're talking about here at WhiteHouse.gov. Go to WhiteHouse.gov and it's all laid out in detail.</p>, <p>For now, here are the five key points I want to expand on slightly.</p>, <p>We're expanding our national booster campaign</p>, <p>to provide booster shots to all eligible adults.</p>, <p>Our docs and the scientists believe that people who get a</p>, <p>booster shot are more protected than ever from COVID-19.</p>, <p>I was just told, which -- a question I got to ask -- I've been meaning to ask for a long time -- whether or not not just it increases the -- the resistance to the variant that is being dealt with, but it also is -- it is stronger. It not only just raises the total, but it's a stronger -- makes things more powerful, in terms of resisting.</p>, <p>And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- the CDC; the Food and Drug Administration -- the FDA; and our top public [health] officials recommend all adults -- all adults get a booster shot when it's time.</p>, <p>But here's the deal: More than about 100 million are eligible for boosters but haven't gotten the booster shot yet.</p>, <p>Folks, if you're over the age of 18 and you got vaccinated before June the 2nd, six months has gone by. Go get your booster now. Go get it now.</p>, <p>Booster shots continue to be free. We've already made available 80,000 locations coast-to-coast in the United States of America -- 80,000 locations to get the booster.</p>, <p>And if you want to know exactly where to go, text your ZIP Code to 438829 to find where you can get your booster shot now -- now.</p>, <p>And starting today, we're making it easier than ever to get a booster shot.</p>, <p>I'm calling on pharmacies -- and they've been cooperative -- big and small to offer more appointments, more walk-in hours -- including on weeknights and weekends -- so you can get vaccinated at a time that works best for you and your family.</p>, <p>Pharmacies will send millions of texts and emails to remind their customers to return for their booster shots because they know who got they got the booster at CVC [CVS] you got to -- they're now -- they've agreed they're going to send texts to that particular person when their time is up, when they've met the -- if it's Pfizer or Moderna, six months; if it's J&amp;J, two months.</p>, <p>And to -- you know, to reach out seniors, we're also collaborating with the American Association of Retired Persons -- AARP –- who will be reaching out to their 38 million members. They're going to make an aggressive effort.</p>, <p>They're going to be hosting virtual townhalls to answer questions and even arrange rides for seniors to get their booster shots. And so that will all be coming.</p>, <p>My administration also contacted the 64 [63] mil- -- will contact the 64 [63] million people on Medicare to remind them to get their booster shots. We have the ability to do that from the federal level.</p>, <p>And just like I did to make it easier for folks to get their first and second shots, I'm providing paid off time</p>, <p>for federal employee who goes to get their booster if they're -- the only time they get can it -- the booster -- where they are, if it's at such and such a day in the middle of the day, they can go. All they have to do is demonstrate that's where they went -- or they took their son, daughter, husband, wife, mom, dad -- they get paid. They don't get docked their pay.</p>, <p>And I'm asking other employers in the private sector to do the same thing.</p>, <p>No one should have to choose between a paycheck and getting an additional protection for a booster shot.</p>, <p>Now, I want to reiterate: Dr. Fauci and Dr. Collins believe if you're worried about the Omicron variant, the best thing to do is to get fully vaccinated and then get your booster shot when you're -- when you're eligible.</p>, <p>(Coughs.) Excuse me.</p>, <p>We don't yet believe -- (coughs) -- excuse me -- that additional measures will be needed. But so that we are prepared if needed, my team is already working with officials at Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson to develop contingency plans for other vaccines or boosters.</p>, <p>And I'll also direct the FDA and the CDC to use the fastest process available without cutting corners on -- for safety to get such vaccines renewed -- reviewed and renewed -- reviewed and approved if they're needed.</p>, <p>Second, we're expanding our efforts to vaccinate children ages five and up. For any parent worried about Omicron variant or the Delta variant, get your child vaccinated at one of 35,000 locations in the country, including doctors' offices, pharmacies, children's hospitals, and 9,000 pop-up clinics at schools.</p>, <p>If you're wondering where to go, again, visit Vaccines.com [Vaccines.gov].</p>, <p>And today, I'm announcing that we're going to launch hundreds of new family vaccination clinics across the country. These sites are going to offer vaccinations for the whole family -- one stop. One stop. Children can get vaccinated. Parents can get vaccinated, get their second -- first or second shots or their booster shots.</p>, <p>Family vaccination clinics will be held in community health centers and other trusted locations. Some will be mobile to reach further into hard-to-reach communities. If it's booster shots for adults, vaccinations for kids -- all at the same place at the same time.</p>, <p>Now, you know, when we first announced, I said the logistical problem -- it wasn't just that we didn't have enough vaccines when we got into office. But once we got the vaccine, the logistical effort to get all communities and all areas vaccinated was a gigantic logistical undertaking that would make any military proud of being able to do it. But because of the incredible talent, including our military, we got that done. And we can do the same thing now as we continue to expand.</p>, <p>We know parents of children under the age of five are wondering when the vaccine will be available for their little ones. That's the question I most get often asked now at functions.</p>, <p>We had a function celebrating Hanukkah and Christmas and various things at the White House. The parents coming up to me, they're saying, ""I have a three-year-old. Is there going to be a time that that can -- am I going to be okay? Is she going to be okay -- or he going to be okay?""</p>, <p>And let me say this: I strongly support the independent scientific review of vaccine usage for children under five. We can't tak- -- take shortcuts with that scientific work.</p>, <p>But I'll do everything in my power to support the FDA to do this safely and quickly as possible when we get to that -- to that point.</p>, <p>Vaccinating our children is also critical to keeping our schools open. But while over 99 percent of schools are open now, we need to make sure we keep that throughout the winter -- this winter.</p>, <p>The CDC is now reviewing pioneering approaches like -- it's going to be called ""test to stay"" -- ""test to stay"" policies, which would allow students to stay in the classroom and be tested frequently when a positive case in that classroom popped up and it wasn't them. Up to now you get -- go home and you quarantine. But rather than being sent home and quarantining, they'd be able to stay because a test would be available and regularly.</p>, <p>The CDC will be releasing the latest science and other findings in the coming weeks so that other schools can learn from -- from the impediment -- excuse me -- if there's any impediments in this practice, they can learn to implement exactly what the best way to do this is. This is a process.</p>, <p>We want our children in school, and we are going to take new steps to make sure they stay -- it stays that way.</p>, <p>But again, the best step is to vaccinate your children. Get them vaccinated.</p>, <p>The third, this winter we are going to make free at-home tests more available to Americans than ever before.</p>, <p>To better detect and control the Delta variant, I made testing more available, affordable, and convenient. I used the Defense Production Act to increase production of rapid tests, including at-home tests.</p>, <p>When I came into office, none of these tests were on the market. Thanks to our actions and the work of all of you, we now have at least eight at-home testing options and prices for those tests are coming down. But it still isn't good enough, in my view.</p>, <p>That's why I am announcing that health insurers must cover the cost of at-home testing. So that if you're one of the 150 million Americans with private health insurance, next month your plan will cover at-home tests.</p>, <p>Private insurers already cover the expensive PCR test and -- that you get at a doctor's office. And now they will cover at-home tests as well.</p>, <p>Now, for those not covered by private insurance, we're going to make available free tests at thousands of convenient locations -- locations for folks to pick them up and take a test kit home.</p>, <p>The bottom line: This winter, you'll be able to test for free in the comfort of your home and have some peace of mind.</p>, <p>This is on top of the 20,000 sites already around the country, like pharmacies, where you can go in and get tested for free. We have to keep this going.</p>, <p>Fourth, we're going to continue to help communities that experience rising cases this winter and improve the care -- the care for those who get COVID-19.</p>, <p>Since this summer, we have worked with Republican and Democratic governors -- as many Republican governors as Democratic governors -- to deploy what we call ""surge response teams.""</p>, <p>These teams work. They provide needed staff for staff overruns at -- badly needed staff where over-run hospitals are handling more patients than they can -- they can handle for their emergency rooms and intensive care units who don't have the personnel available. They help provide lifesaving treatments in communities in need, like monoclonal antibody treatments.</p>, <p>We have over 20 teams deployed now.</p>, <p>Today, I'm announcing that we're going to triple that -- more than double. We're going to get to 60 teams ready to deploy to states that experience a surge in cases over the course of this winter.</p>, <p>I was just with the governor in Minnesota, who is raving about the positive impact it's had on his state. But there's other states the same -- in the same circumstance.</p>, <p>Additionally, were increasing the availability of new medicines recommended by real doctors, not conspiracy theorists. Okay?</p>, <p>For example, monoclonal antibody treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by up to 70 percent and --for unvaccinated people at risk of developing severe disease.</p>, <p>We've already distributed over 3 million courses of these treatments to save lives and reduce the strain on hospitals.</p>, <p>And we have -- we're -- we have promising new arrival pill -- excuse me, antiviral pills on the horizon that could help prevent hospitalizations and death of people infected by COVID-19.</p>, <p>We've secured enough supply of these pills already. And early indications are that these treatments will remain effective in the face of Omicron.</p>, <p>We don't know that for sure yet, but that's the hope and expectation.</p>, <p>And like with the distribution of the vaccines, we will ensure that these medicines will be available to the hardest-hit communities in America as well.</p>, <p>Fifth and finally, as we've seen with COVID-19 and the Delta variant and now with the Omicron variant, all that emerged elsewhere; it all came from somewhere else. And ultimately, beat this pan- -- we -- to beat this pandemic, we need to go to where it came and the rest of the world.</p>, <p>We also need to vaccinate the rest of the world. America has, in my view -- continues to lead in that effort.</p>, <p>We have shipped, for free, more vaccines around the world than all other countries in the world combined -- every other country combined. Over 280 million vaccines far to 110 countries, including to South Africa, where we've delivered all the doses they requested.</p>, <p>Now, today I am announcing that we'll accelerate the delivery of more vaccines to countries that need it, pledging to deliver 200 million dose -- more doses within the next 100 days -- on our way to delivering more than 1,200,000,000 doses for the rest of the world.</p>, <p>Let me be clear: Not a single vaccine dose America ever sends to the rest of the world will ever come at the expense of any American. I'll always make sure that our people are protected first. But vaccinating the world is not just a moral tool -- a moral obligation that we have, in my view; it's how we protect Americans, as we're seeing with this new variant.</p>, <p>America is doing our part, and we'll do more. But this is a global pandemic, and everyone needs to fight it together.</p>, <p>And that includes countries we're helping that aren't particularly friendly toward us. Their populations are in trouble.</p>, <p>To their credit, the scientific community, particularly in South Africa, quickly notified the world of the emergence of this new variant.</p>, <p>This kind of transparency is to be encouraged and applauded because it increases our ability to respond quickly to any new threats. And that's what we did.</p>, <p>On the very day the World Health Organization identified the new variant, I took an immediate step to restrict travel from the countries in South -- in Southern Africa.</p>, <p>But while we know that travel restrictions can slow the spread of Omicron, they cannot prevent it. But it does give us a little more time to take more precautions at home to prepare.</p>, <p>A month ago, we announced requirements that foreign travelers must be vaccinated if entering the United States.</p>, <p>This week, I announced an additional action to strengthen international travel rules to give us more time to stop the spread and study a new variant.</p>, <p>It used to be that an international travel flying to the United State- -- traveler flying to the United States had to test negatively three days before their departure from the other -- that country.</p>, <p>Well, I'm announcing today that all inbound international travelers must test within one day of departure, regardless of their vaccination status or nationality.</p>, <p>This tighter testing timeline provides an added degree of protection as scientists continue to study the Omicron variant.</p>, <p>And we are extending the requirement, both internationally and domestically, to wear masks for travel on aircraft, trains, and public transportation through the winter months.</p>, <p>I'll close with this. Again, the actions I'm announcing are ones that all Americans can rally behind and should unite us in the fight against COVID-19.</p>, <p>And they come from a position of strength. We are better positioned than we were a year ago to fight COVID-19.</p>, <p>Since day one of my administration, we've been doing everything we can to beat this virus. And that's what we have to keep doing. That's how we keep our country and our businesses and our schools open.</p>, <p>And that's how, even with a pandemic, we've generated record job creation -- 5.6 million new jobs since January 20th -- more than any President in American history.</p>, <p>We're on the track to the fastest economic growth in four decades -- in four decades.</p>, <p>We have moved forward in the face of COVID-19 and the Delta variant. And we'll move forward in the face of Omicron variant as well. And we'll do it by keeping the faith and doing it together as the United States of America.</p>, <p>Let me close again by saying God bless our doctors, our scientists, and all of you here at the NIH for what you're doing for the country and, quite frankly, for the world. You're the best. You're the very, very best. May God bless you all. And thank you for your patience in listening to me. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>, <p>Q: Will there be a shutdown on Friday, sir? Will these government employees receive their paychecks? Will there be a government shutdown on Friday, sir?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible.)</p>, <p>Q: Will there be a government shutdown on Friday, sir?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: No.</p>, <p>Q: How will you see to it?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: How could you ask such a silly question? , You see, I -- look, I don't believe that will happen. We have everything in place to be able to make sure there is not a shutdown unless some individual, not --</p>, <p>I spoke with Mitch McConnell, I spoke with Schumer. There is a plan in place, unless somebody decides to be totally erratic. And I don't think that will happen, so I don't think there will be a shutdown.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>]"

Biden,Remarks During a Menorah Lighting in Celebration of Hanukkah,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-during-menorah-lighting-celebration-hanukkah,"[<p>THE PRESIDENT: (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please. Thank you. Please. Thank you. My name is Joe Biden, and I am Jill's husband -- (laughter) -- as I'm known here in Washington and many other places.</p>, <p>I -- Happy Hanukkah, everyone.</p>, <p>AUDIENCE: Happy Hanukkah.</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: You know, first, I want to thank Doug and Kamala. And this is a White House tradition -- a White House tradition -- but the first time in history it is a family tradition.</p>, <p>Doug, we're honored that you -- you're leading the Menorah lighting.</p>, <p>And I -- I see my dear friends in -- from Congress and the community out there, many of whom I've known for a long, long time.</p>, <p>And I know how many more are joining us virtually.</p>, <p>You know, first of all, I want to welcome our Cabinet members: Attorney General Merrick Garland. Stand up so they can see you, Merrick. (Applause.) He is practicing the Jewish tradition of restoring justice to the Justice Department. (Applause.)</p>, <p>And Secretary of Homeland Security, Ali Mayorkas, who has maybe one of the toughest jobs in government, one of the -- the widest breadth. And I want to thank you, Ali, for all you do. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>, <p>And one of the brightest scientists and docs I know: the head of OSTP, Director Eric Lander. Eric. (Applause.)</p>, <p>And I want to welcome Israel's newest Ambassador to the United States, Michael Herzog. Michael. (Applause.) Just please stand up. Come on, stand up. Ambassador, I look forward to working with you to reaffirm the longstanding ties between the United States and the State of Israel.</p>, <p>I was saying to a couple of younger members of my staff, before I came over, about the many times I've been to Israel. I said -- and then, all of a sudden, I realized, ""God, you're getting old, Biden."" (Laughter.)</p>, <p>I have known every -- every prime minister well since Golda Meir, including Golda Meir. (Applause.) And during the Six-Day War, I had an opportunity to -- she invited me to come over because I was going to be the liaison between she and the Egyptians about the Suez, and so on and so forth.</p>, <p>And I sat in front of her desk, Chuck. And she had a guy -- her staff member -- to my right. His name was Rabin. (Laughter.) And she kept flipping those maps up and down. She had that bevy of maps -- sort of kept it -- and it was -- it was so depressing what she was -- about what happened. She gave me every detail.</p>, <p>And all of a sudden, she looked at me and she said, ""Mr. Ambassador, would you like a photograph?"" And I thought, ""Okay."" We got up. We walked out. And the three of us are standing in that -- that rectangular area outside the office.</p>, <p>And we -- the photographer, she was taking pictures and the press. And, Chuck, without turning her head, she looked straight ahead, but, talking to me, she said, ""Why…"" She said, ""Why do you look so sad?"" And I said -- and I almost turned. And I said, ""Well, Madam Prime Minister,"" I said, ""you've painted such a dismal picture.""</p>, <p>She said, ""Oh, no, no, no."" She said, ""Don't worry. We have a secret weapon in our battle in this area."" And I almost turned again. I said, ""What's that?"" She said, ""We have no place else to go.""</p>, <p>Ladies and gentlemen, you know, as Doug leads our candle lighting, he'll be joined by Leader Schumer, a good friend of mine.</p>, <p>Chuck, we're so sorry about your dad. Abe was -- passed away. And, Chuck, you said in the eulogy to your dad -- if you don't mind my saying this -- you said he never quit, he never cut corners, he led by example, he knew we had a responsibility to others beyond ourselves, and he lived with the conviction that doing the right thing, even when it doesn't -- when others don't, will lead to success.</p>, <p>Chuck, you described you. You described you, pal. And I -- you could use the same words to describe you.</p>, <p>And, you know, in Abe's blessed memory, I hope you continue to lead us. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>, <p>We also have a dear friend of mine for more than three decades -- someone many of you know as a devoted leader -- community leader: Susie Stern. Susie, thank you for all you've done. (Applause.)</p>, <p>And she's joined by Aaron Glatt, an infectious disease doctor and a rabbi. And Rabbi Dr. Glatt has been a champion of encouraging his congregants and his community to get vaccinated.</p>, <p>And I also love Rabbi Dr. Glatt's description of Hanukkah. He said, and I quote, ""A Jewish holiday of -- is Hanukkah -- a Jewish -- the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah is Thanksgiving on steroids."" (Laughter.) Thanksgiving on steroids. Well, that's pretty good from Rabbi Dr. Glatt. Theologic- -- theological and medical opinion merged into one. (Laughter.)</p>, <p>Look, more seriously, Rabbi has described America as a ""great nation of kindness."" And that's what we must always be: a great nation of kindness. That's not hyperbole; that's a fact.</p>, <p>You know, we're the most unique nation in the world. We're the only nation that's not based on ethnicity or religion or race. It's -- we're based on an idea. An idea. ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men [and women] are created equal…endowed by their…"" It's an idea.</p>, <p>And so that's why -- and our basis of our strength is not the example of our power, but the power of our example.</p>, <p>In each successive generation, the Hanukkah story provides a powerful lesson and nourishes the wellspring of hope.</p>, <p>In darkness, there's light. In cynicism, there's hope and optimism and an unyielding belief that miracles are possible.</p>, <p>When I was recently -- as Chuck knows, when I was recently with -- talking with Xi Jinping -- he reminded me. He said, ""I know, I know, I know -- as you said when I asked you to define America, you said I can do it in one word: possibilities."" Possibilities. That's who we are: a nation of possibilities.</p>, <p>And one such miracle brings us to a menorah we're lighting tonight. The artist who designed it is Manfred Anson -- was 1 of 20 boys selected by the Jewish Welfare Society to flee from Germany from Austria [to Australia] in the beginning of World War Two.</p>, <p>A miracle, but one shadowed by darkness as his younger brother didn't make it out -- killed in the concentration camp.</p>, <p>Pain. The pain -- it is easy -- in the pain, it's easy to lose hope and harden what's left of a broken heart and a broken soul.</p>, <p>But not Anson. He joined the Australian Army and fought against the fascists.</p>, <p>After the war, his sister, who survived in concentration camps, wrote a letter addressed simply to ""Manfred Anson, Australia."" That was all it said. And it was a miracle: The letter found him. It found him. They reunited.</p>, <p>Their parents had survived the war but had not lived long enough to see their surviving son.</p>, <p>Manfred and his sister came to the United States and, in gratitude, opted [sic] -- it was his adopted homeland. He began collecting thousands of souvenirs of little Statues of Liberty, of the U.S. Capitol, and the Liberty Bell, which is what he used to design this menorah -- this menorah we're going to pay tribute to. Two centuries of two cultures.</p>, <p>This menorah is on loan from the National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia, just across from the Liberty Bell itself.</p>, <p>And one of the honors of my career was helping dedicate the museum in 2010, where I had a tough job following -- Jerry Seinfeld and Bette Midler were the other two speakers. (Laughter.) Thank God, they didn't ask me to sing. (Laughter.)</p>, <p>But I was honored to join my dear friend and museum founder, Ron Rubin -- who passed away this year -- after dedicating that essential institution.</p>, <p>Anson passed away in 2012, and this is the second of his menorahs to be in the White House. As we honor his work, we also honor the abiding lesson of his life -- that we must be grateful for our freedoms and we must defend those freedoms.</p>, <p>That -- as my dear friend and colleague who worked for me, for a long time -- my staff -- before he became a prominent figure in the Congress himself, Tom Lantos, often reminded us, in words borne out of personal experiences escaping from Hungary, and that -- over 2,000 years of wisdom. This is what he said -- he said, ""The veneer of civilization is paper thin. We are its guardians, and we can never rest.""</p>, <p>Well, it's paper thin. And we are its guardians. All it takes is an opening, a sliver, a crack, the briefest nod of acceptance or legitimacy for ancient evils that have long plagued our society to come rushing in. And you all know it.</p>, <p>We just saw an incident so horribly anti-Semitic -- flyers being left at people's homes in Los Angeles.</p>, <p>We have to stand against the resurgence of this tide of anti-Semitism and other forms of intolerance and hate here at home and around the world.</p>, <p>In that effort, there is nobody more qualified than Professor Deborah Lipstadt to -- our Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat -- (applause) -- Combat Antisemitism.</p>, <p>You know, when we light this menorah in the White House, when Jewish families place menorahs in their windows, we are proclaiming liberty. We're exercising the freedom that the Maccabees sought to simply practice their faith. And we're showing that there is still light, that even the most fragile flame can be sustained in a tradition and nourish the soul of a people.</p>, <p>That little bit of light -- that little bit of light, wherever it is found, can dispel the darkness and illuminate a path forward. And whether it's in the Temple in Jerusalem or a temple of our democracy, nothing broken or profaned is beyond repair. Nothing.</p>, <p>We can always build back better or perhaps build back brighter.</p>, <p>So, thank you all for being here as we proclaim the light and liberty that this is all about.</p>, <p>And now I want to turn us over to another special guest, Rabbi Lauren Hols- -- Holtzblatt -- Holtzblatt -- excuse me -- you can call me ""Bidden"" -- (laughter) -- I apologize, Lauren -- who reminded all of us so powerfully after her eulogy for Ruth Bader Ginsburg that despair -- despair is never, ever an option. Never.</p>, <p>Rabbi, please come forward. (Applause.)</p>]"

Biden,"Remarks to Commemorate World AIDS Day, Launch the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, and Kick Off the Global Fund Replenishment Process",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-commemorate-world-aids-day-launch-the-national-hivaids-strategy-and-kick-off-the,"[<p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Please, sit down. Mom, come on up here a minute. Come on. (Laughter.) I want you to meet Gabe's mom, who I still believe is more like his sister -- (laughter) -- than his mom. She is the inspiration. She is the reason why this young man has done such incredible things.</p>, <p>And it's a simple lesson -- my mother always told me: Listen to your mom. (Laughter.)</p>, <p>MS. WHEELER-LARA: Yes.</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. You deserve a great deal of praise. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>, <p>MS. WHEELER-LARA: Thank you so much. Thank you.</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: And one other thing before I begin my formal remarks. I look out in the audience and I see so many people who've been in this battle for so long. But the one person who I know from personal experience -- having been here for more than 40 years -- who has been a champion when it was viewed as political suicide to be a champion was the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi. (Applause.) Nancy, stand up. Stand up.</p>, <p>There was many others behind her as well. But, Nancy -- not a joke -- you were the one who started that fight in a way that you took it on with such passion. And it wasn't -- it was not -- it was viewed as a political death sentence to take this issue on at the time. But you did it. You fundamentally changed the way we looked at this. You even got George Bush to lead on this, too. (Laughter.)</p>, <p>No, but all kidding aside, you -- I just want to personally, in front of all these people and all the world, thank you for your incredible work.</p>, <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I'm also joined by the Second Gentleman. He is a hell of a lawyer. (Laughter.) And I thank him for being here.</p>, <p>And, Mr. Secretary, thank you for your leadership of HHS.</p>, <p>I -- and I want to thank Gabe for sharing his story, because -- you know, you committed your life to this work, Gabe. I don't know whether you had that plan when you began it, but it's amazing what you've done. It's amazing what one person can do. It's an honor to meet with you both and to learn more about the work you're doing together to support your community.</p>, <p>Folks, we're also joined today by many who have been part of this effort for decades, including Dr. Fauci, who is -- I -- he's all things to -- (applause) -- Doc, you're the best. And you never walk away from an issue or a problem. Thank you.</p>, <p>And to all of you who have contributed so much to this mission of advocating for better prevention services for those at risk of getting HIV and improved care services; and living with HIV, breaking down the stigma, and from -- and the disinformation that still exists around HIV/AIDS, I want to thank you -- thank you for your voices and for putting your hearts into your work. Because that's what you do, you put your hearts into the work, and people can tell.</p>, <p>It's because of all of you and the dedication of scientists and activists around the world that we've been able to dramatically reduce new HIV transmissions and make individuals with HIV today lead long and healthy lives.</p>, <p>And, you know, it's because of the persistence and the resilience of the HIV community that we've changed so much about the way we approach healthcare, research, and equitable access to services -- even the relationship between patients and healthcare providers.</p>, <p>You know, and it's because of you -- and it's not hyperbole to suggest it -- that we are within a striking distance of eliminating HIV transmission. Within striking distance. (Applause.)</p>, <p>And I think everybody but Nancy couldn't have imagined this -- us being there 40 years ago. But the fact is that when the CDC reported the first cases that -- of what we now know as AIDS.</p>, <p>It's something that we couldn't fully imagine even 20 years ago before the landmark investments that the United States made through PEPFAR and -- President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.</p>, <p>But you made it possible. You made it possible. And I want to take this moment on this historic anniversary to acknowledge the incredible passion and the work that got us here. Because I know -- I know that so many of you -- for so many of you, this is personal.</p>, <p>Today, we once more raise a two-story-tall red ribbon on the North Portico of the White House to remember how far we've come, the work we have left to finish, and so we never forget the price -- the price that's paid all along the way.</p>, <p>And so many of you know and have relations with people who have -- whether they're family members or friends that you've watched them, in the past, whither way.</p>, <p>In the past four decades, as has been mentioned, an estimated 36 million people -- 36 million people, including more than 700,000 here in the United States, have died of AIDS-related illnesses.</p>, <p>Think about that. That many people -- more than almost all the modern wars combined -- all the wars combined.</p>, <p>Here at home, we saw entire communities devastated by this disease, particularly among the LGBTQ+ individuals and members of racial and ethnic minority groups that Gabe has already spoken to. And a generation that endured the brunt -- the brunt of this epidemic: losing friends, loved ones, family members, partners -- instead of being seen and being recognized.</p>, <p>And I can recall -- if you excuse the point of personal privilege -- being, I think, in this very room when a senator who -- he's deceased now, so I don't want to mention his name because he can't defend himself -- but standing up and saying, along with another guy named Jerry Falwell, this is ""God's punishment."" I'm paraphrasing it. ""God's punishment. Finally.""</p>, <p>Think how much has changed. I mean, back in those days, the willingness of other members of the Senate and the House to stand up and take him on was -- Nancy was there. Many of you were there. But it wasn't a universal thing. Wasn't a universal thing.</p>, <p>But you all demanded -- demanded to be treated with dignity and with equity. Those voices, those stories are invaluable.</p>, <p>As we recommit ourselves to finishing the fight -- that we are going to make these individuals living with AIDS and are helping them drive and inform our efforts at every step of the way, because we're going to finish this fight.</p>, <p>And so, when my administration came to office, not only -- not only did we reestablish the White House Office of National AIDS Policy, which -- (applause) -- it's hard to believe.</p>, <p>I don't deserve any cred- -- that was the easiest possible thing to do. (Laughter.) No, I really mean it. Think about it. Think about it. That it gets a round of applause in the year 2021 when we say that. I mean, it -- it should have never, ever -- well, any- -- well, I don't want to get into that. But, anyway. (Laughter.)</p>, <p>And I've asked Harold Phillips to lead our efforts. Harold -- (applause) -- stand up, Harold. (Applause.)Harold, I think they know you. (Laughter.)</p>, <p>Harold has dedicated -- he has decades of experience working with -- to end AIDS, the HIV epidemic. And I want to thank him for his leadership and willingness to -- to join the administration, and releasing the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for 2022 to 2025. That's -- that's what he's doing.</p>, <p>It's a roadmap for how we're going to put our foot on the gas and accelerate our efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the United States by the year 2030. That's the goal. (Applause.)</p>, <p>And it centers on the kind of innovative, community solutions -- community-driven solutions that we know will work.</p>, <p>It's a plan to make sure that the latest -- the latest advances in HIV prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are available to everyone, regardless of their age, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or other factors.</p>, <p>It shouldn't matter where you live in the country or how much money you make or how you respond or how we -- we have to respond across the board to the HIV epidemic everywhere and support all people living with HIV.</p>, <p>And, critically, this strategy takes on racial and gender disparities in our health system that for much too long have affected HIV outcomes in our country -- to ensure that our national response is a truly equitable response.</p>, <p>So, we're going to take aggressive action and back it up. We've asked Congress for $670 million -- an historic budget request -- for the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the United States initiative. And I'm confident we're going to get that done. Right, team? (Applause.)</p>, <p>We've got some great congressional champions for this work here today, starting with a woman who, as I said -- I've already mentioned, as she -- a leader on the issue from the moment she set foot in Congress, starting with Nancy.</p>, <p>But also Representative Barbara Lee. Barbara Lee, please. (Applause.) Maxine Waters. (Applause.) I learned a long time ago, when Maxine says, ""I have an idea,"" just say ""yes"". (Laughter.) Just say ""yes.""</p>, <p>And Sean Patrick Maloney. Sean. (Applause.) Jenniffer –- David Cicilline. David. (Applause.) And Jenniffer González-Colon. (Applause.)</p>, <p>Thanks for all you're doing. I really -- I was going to say -- not for your support -- this is sui generis with all of you. You're just incredibly committed to this.</p>, <p>And it's an issue that has a long history of bipartisan support, so I'm looking forward to working across the aisle, God willing.</p>, <p>I want make sure that everyone in the United States knows their HIV status, that everyone with HIV receives high-quality care and treatment that they deserve, and that we end the harmful stigma around HIV and AIDS. (Applause.)</p>, <p>In particular, there is still a large number of states with HI- -- that have HIV criminalization laws that do not reflect an accurate understanding of HIV.</p>, <p>For example -- (applause) -- HIV cannot be transmitted through saliva. There are still laws on the books that criminalize spitting by people with HIV. I mean, this is 2021, the United States of America.</p>, <p>But we have to follow science, and that means eliminating the laws that perpetuate discrimination, exacerbate disparities, discourage HIV testing, and take us further away from our goal. We can do this.</p>, <p>And as we accelerate our efforts at home, we're not going to let up on the efforts to fa- -- fight HIV/AIDS globally.</p>, <p>Leading the reauthorization of PEPFAR in 2008 was among the highlights of my time as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. And at the time -- (applause) –- and by the way, I was not one of the great leaders in this. I -- I always supported the effort, but it wasn't –- it was because I was chairman of the committee.</p>, <p>And believe it or not, there was a Republican President -- and I'm not being a wise guy when I say this -- who pushed for PEPFAR. There is an undeniable proof of the good that American leadership and innovation can achieve in the world when we commit to it. We have a moral obligation to do that and continue.</p>, <p>Since President Bush launched PEPFAR in 2003, we've saved more than 21 million lives. (Applause.) We've prevented –- (applause) -- we've prevented millions of HIV infections. And we've helped at least 20 countries bring their HIV epidemics under control or reach their U.N. AIDS 90-90-90 treatment targets. That means 90 percent of the people living with HIV in a country will know their HIV status; 90 percent of HIV-positive individuals are able to access treatment; and 90 percent of those receiving treatment for HIV will have -- will have suppressed viral loads.</p>, <p>That's within our power. We're doing that.</p>, <p>And though PEPFAR -- through PEPFAR, the United States will support nearly 19 million men, women, and children with lifesaving HIV treatment. It's an incredible, incredible achievement.</p>, <p>Those are not only lives saved though. They are -– they're communities that are strengthened by the –- by the talents and contributions of HIV-positive individuals who are here today leading productive lives and leading the community because of what you've all done.</p>, <p>And as we have faced COVID-19 pandemic, we've also reaped additional benefits from our decades-long investment in strengthening health systems around the world through PEPFAR.</p>, <p>Working through the CDC and USAID, PEPFAR supports more than 70,000 case -- care facilities, 3,000 laboratories, and nearly 300,000 healthcare workers across 55 countries, all of which have been vital in supporting the global fight against COVID-19.</p>, <p>By strengthening countries' abilities to fight AIDS, we've also improved our collective ability to fight other diseases.</p>, <p>And I want to thank and recognize a guy that I can't believe all he has done: Dr. John -- John Nkenga- -- Nkengasong. Nkengasong. I apologize, Doc. (Applause.) And, Doc -- Doc Nkengasong, stand up. And, Doc -- Doc -- Dr. Nkengasong, you can call me ""Joe Bidden."" (Laughter.)</p>, <p>But you're helping lead the important work of Omicron variant in this current role as Director of Africa's CDC and who is my nominee for Ambassador-at-Large to oversee PEPFAR -- (applause) -- and our global efforts to conbay [sic] -- combat HIV.</p>, <p>I understand you're joined by Peter Sands. Peter, stand up, will you? (Applause.) The Executive Director -- the Executive Director of the Global Fund.</p>, <p>This year marks 20 years of the Global Fund, and the United States is proud to be both a founding member of the Fund and the largest contributor. And the United States is looking forward to hosting the Global Fund's Seventh Replenishment Conference next year here. And so, thank you. (Applause.)</p>, <p>We still have a difficult road ahead of us -- we can't kid ourselves -- particularly, addressing the disparities we see both domestically and globally, including the impact of high transmission rates among adolescent girls and young women.</p>, <p>And today, as we look back on the past 40 years, where there has been so much pain and suffering, it's a testament to all -- all the hard work represented in this room and around the world that we are gathered today with hope in our hearts and for the future that's within our grasp.</p>, <p>We can do this. We can do this. We can eliminate HIV transmission. We can get the epidemic under control here in the United States and in countries around the world.</p>, <p>We have the scientific understanding, we have the treatments, and we have the tools we need.</p>, <p>We're going to engage with people with live -- with lived experience with HIV and ensure that our efforts are appropriate and effective, and centered around the needs of the HIV community. Not (inaudible) -- centered around the needs of the community.</p>, <p>And folks, together, we're going to save lives. I can imagine no higher calling to which we could be dedicated than our commitment to save lives. And this is the one area where we can get a lot more done quickly.</p>, <p>So, I want to thank you all again. I'm honored to be with you today. And this is one heck of a group of people who have hearts that are as big as their heads. And thank God. (Laughter.) Thank God. Have in those beautiful skulls so much knowledge and capacity. (Laughter and applause.)</p>, <p>So, thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Anyway, thanks.</p>]"
0,4,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the Nation's Supply Chains and an Exchange with Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-nations-supply-chains-and-exchange-with-reporters,"[<p>THE PRESIDENT: Sorry to keep you waiting. Good afternoon. It's wonderful to see the holiday decorations here in the White House. Tomorrow, I'm going to light the National Christmas Tree to help kick off the holiday season.</p>, <p>Whatever you celebrate, we are looking ahead to a</p>, <p>brighter and happier December with an economy markedly stronger than it was last year.</p>, <p>It's been a tough couple of years, but we've made incredible progress. And, today, I'd like to speak about some of the steps we're taking to address challenges in the economy and how those actions are already starting to pay off for American families.</p>, <p>First, however, I want to quickly reiterate what I spoke about on Monday concerning Omicron, the vir- -- the variant -- and the steps we're taking to combat it.</p>, <p>As I said, this new variant is a cause for concern but not a cause for panic.</p>, <p>We have the best vaccines in the world, the best medicines, the best scientists. We're learning more every single day. And we'll fight this variant with science and speed, not chaos and confusion.</p>, <p>So, let me repeat what the doctors and scientists have affirmed: The best protection against Omicron is getting a booster shot. Right now, about 135 million Americans are eligible for a booster but only about 40 million have gotten one thus far.</p>, <p>If you're over 18 years of age, you got vaccinated before January -- excuse me, June 1, go get your booster today. And if you're not vaccinated, now is the time to get vaccinated and take your children to get vaccinated. Every child over the age five can get a safe, effective vaccination.</p>, <p>Tomorrow, I'll be putting forward the next steps that we'll be taking to fight COVID this winter -- not with shutdowns or lockdowns but with more widespread vaccinations, boosters, testing, and more.</p>, <p>Now, on to the economy. If you've watched the news recently, you might think the shelves in all our stores are empty across the country, that parents won't be able to get presents for their children on holidays -- this holiday season.</p>, <p>But here's the deal: For the vast majority of the country, that's not what's happening. Because of the actions the administration has taken in partnership with business and labor, retailers and grocery stores, freight movers and railroads, those shelves are going to be stocked.</p>, <p>And many have heard that the CEO of Walmart, who I met with this week, speaking about the steps we've taken. He said, and I quote, ""The combination of private enterprise and government working together has been really successful… All the way through the supply chain, there's been a lot of innovation."" End of quote.</p>, <p>Here's what the progress has looked like. The first thing we had to do was speed up the operations at our ports. Americans are buying more goods than ever and a lot of those goods come through our ports. 40 percent of the goods that come into the country on the West Coast come through two ports: Los Angeles and Long Beach.</p>, <p>To help relieve congestion, I brought together labor and management and asked them to step up and cooperate more -- to move toward operating those ports not five days a week, 40 hours a week; but 24 hours a day, seven days a week by adding more shifts at night and on the weekends.</p>, <p>Then we had to make sure people could transport those goods</p>, <p>from the ports to stores and homes across the country. We've broken up logjams there as well.</p>, <p>Private-sector port terminal operators at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, for example, have announced that they will eliminate fees when truck drivers come on the port -- come into the port to pick up the containers if they do it at night or on weekends when roads are less congested.</p>, <p>Working with my administration, a major ocean carrier -- the fourth largest in the world -- announced on Monday a new $100 discount when containers are picked up quickly, with larger discounts for nighttime and weekend pickups.</p>, <p>And we've announced this week that we are extending through February extra flexibility that allows truckers to drive more hours when they transporting critical goods like gas, food, and medical supplies.</p>, <p>Paired with the -- these important safety measures, all of them are going to help move goods more quickly and get products that people want onto store shelves all across the country.</p>, <p>Over the last month, the number of containers left sitting on docks blocking movement to those stores is over -- was for over eight days. Now it's down -- it's down by 40 percent, which means they're heading to shelves in stores more quickly.</p>, <p>That's an incredible success story. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have moved 16 percent more containers so far this year than last year.</p>, <p>By working with business and labor, my administration has been able to handle the huge surge in goods moving through some of our biggest ports. And that has translated into shelves across our country being well-stocked.</p>, <p>You don't have to take my word for it. On Monday, I convened a group of CEOs from some of the largest retailers and grocery stores in the nation, as well as companies who work with small businesses across America, including the CEO of Walmart, as I mentioned, along with Best Buy, CVS, Samsung, Mattel, Etsy, and QVC.</p>, <p>My administration has been working with many of the C- -- CEOs and others to keep goods moving through our supply chains to ensure the shelves are stocked heading into the holiday season.</p>, <p>The CEOs I met with this week reported that their inventories are up, shelves are well-stocked, and they're ready to meet the consumer demand for the holidays.</p>, <p>The CEO of -- of Etsy represents over 5 million small businesses and entrepreneurs. He told me, and I quote, ""Our survey data says there are less -- they are less concerned about supply chain challenges this year than they were last year."" End of quote.</p>, <p>I've also spoken with the CEOs of UPS and FedEx, which are on track to deliver more packages than ever.</p>, <p>Now, I can't promise that every person will get every gift they want on time. Only Santa Claus can keep that promise. But there are items every year that sell out, that are hard to find.</p>, <p>Some of you moms and dads may remember Cabbage Patch Kids back in the '80s or Beanie Babies in the '90s, or other toys that have run out at Christmas time in past years when there was no supply chain problem.</p>, <p>But we're heading into a holiday season on very strong shape. And it's not because of luck. We averted potential crisis by figuring out what needed to get fixed and then we brought people together to do the hard work of fixing it.</p>, <p>That's exactly what we're doing with the second concern I want to talk about today: prices.</p>, <p>Here are a few things you should know: Just about every country in the world is grappling with higher prices right now as they recover from the pandemic.</p>, <p>In the United Kingdom, price increases have hit a 10-year high. In Germany, a 28-year high. In Canada, price increases are the highest they've been since the '90s.</p>, <p>This is a worldwide challenge -- a natural byproduct of a world economy shut down by the pandemic as it comes back to life.</p>, <p>Prices are still out of sunk -- excuse me -- prices are still out of sync as the world comes back. But as we continue to overcome these obstacles, the more price pressures will ease.</p>, <p>But I have not been content to sit back and wait. I've used every tool available to address the price increases. And it's working.</p>, <p>Take gas prices: Last week, I announced the largest-ever release from the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase the supply of oil and help bring down prices.</p>, <p>I brought together other nations to continue and contribute to the solution. India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom all joined us. They all agreed to release additional oil from their reserves. And China may be doing so as well.</p>, <p>This worldwide effort we're leading will not solve the problem of high gas prices overnight, but it has been making a difference.</p>, <p>Over the last month, likely due in part to anticipation of this action, we've seen the price of oil and gasoline on the wholesale markets come down significantly.</p>, <p>In fact, since the end of October, the average weekly price of gasoline in the wholesale market has fallen by about 10 percent. That's a drop of 25 cents per gallon.</p>, <p>Those savings should reach the American people very soon, and it can't happen fast enough.</p>, <p>And I've asked the Federal Trade Commission to consider whether potentially illegal and anti-competitive behavior in the oil and gas industry is causing higher prices to remain -- be maintained for consumers when the overall cost of oil is down. We can also ensure that American people are paying a fair price for gas.</p>, <p>So, let's take a step back and take stock of where our economy is. Wages are up. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we've delivered significant tax cuts for families raising kids.</p>, <p>Tax cuts and rising wages for middle-class families mean that Americans, on average, have about $100 more in their pockets every month and -- than they did last year -- about $350 more each month than they did before the pandemic, even after accounting for inflation.</p>, <p>Let me repeat that: Even after accounting for rising prices, the typical American family has more money in their pockets than they did last year or the year before that.</p>, <p>In fact, we're the only leading economy in the world where household income and the economy as a whole are stronger than they were before the pandemic.</p>, <p>You know, there are other signs of strength too. The number of small businesses is up 30 percent compared to before the pandemic.</p>, <p>Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we've cut child poverty in America by more than 40 percent. Think about that: Millions of children who spent last Christmas in poverty will not bear that burden this holiday season. And the Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, described it yesterday, that it is, quote, ""A profound economic and moral victory for [our] country."" End of quote.</p>, <p>Since I took office, we've had record job creation: 5.6 million new jobs since January 20th of this year. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4.6 percent. We're seeing more new small businesses, higher wages, and more disposable income. Fewer children in poverty. Fewer people getting unemployment checks.</p>, <p>None of this was inevitable. It was because of the American Rescue Plan, which virtually every Democrat in Congress voted for and every Republican voted against.</p>, <p>It was because of the hard work my administration has done to try to solve the challenges in our economy, instead of just pointing fingers and complaining.</p>, <p>Now -- now it's time to build on our success and cut costs further for families. That's what my Build Back Better plan does.</p>, <p>It will lower out-of-pocket costs for childcare, eldercare, housing, college, healthcare, and prescription drugs. These are the biggest costs that most families face.</p>, <p>In fact, a new independent analysis released today showed that my Build Back Better plan would mean $7,400 in tax cuts and savings for the typical family with four -- excuse me -- the typical family of four with two kids.</p>, <p>Seventeen Nobel laureate winners in the -- Nobel economics winners have written a letter affirming that this bill will reduce inflationary pressure in the economy.</p>, <p>Two of the leading rating agencies on Wall Street confirmed this month that my plan will not -- will not add to inflationary pressures. In fact, they will, quote, ""take the edge off of inflation.""</p>, <p>Now my Republican friends are talking a lot about prices, but they're lined up against my Build Back Better plan, which would go right at the problem for rising costs for families. Why is that?</p>, <p>I don't want to speculate on anyone's motive. But it's always easier to complain about a problem than to try to fix it.</p>, <p>One Republican senator even said that rising prices were, quote, ""a gold mine,"" end of quote, for Republicans politically. Imagine rooting for higher costs for American families just to score a few political points.</p>, <p>The fact is the Build Back Better plan is fiscally responsible. And it's the first major piece of legislation in more than a decade that is not only fully paid for, but will generate more than $100 billion in deficit reduction.</p>, <p>It fully covers the cost of its investments by making the largest corporations and the richest Americans pay a little more in taxes. Think about that. Because that's a trade-off worth making, in my view: having those who have done very well pay their fair share in order to provide a little breathing room for millions of American families.</p>, <p>But my critics don't seem to agree. They have a lot of speeches about high prices, supply chains, and other challenges we are facing, but they don't offer any answers. So, they're just doing the ""no"" vote. That's their plan: Vote ""no.""</p>, <p>But what does that mean? What does a ""no"" vote mean on this bill? Not on cable news, not on Fox, not -- in the real world, in your life, around your kitchen table.</p>, <p>Well, here's what it's going to mean: It means for millions of American families, this bill -- the bills you're paying right now for daycare could be substantially lowered, capped at 7 percent of your income. But the Republicans said, ""No, pay more.""</p>, <p>It means the bills you're paying right now to take care of your elderly parent could have been lower -- a lot lower. But Republicans said, ""No, don't vote for this bill. Pay more.""</p>, <p>It means the cost of your prescription drugs could have been lower -- a lot lower. But Republicans think that those 200,000 children, for example, who need regular doses of insulin should continue to pay as much as $1,000 a month, instead of $35 a month.</p>, <p>Think of that. It not only affects the health of the child and the family, but imagine you're being a parent and not being able to afford $1,000 a month. Not only it risks the health of your child, but it robs you of your dignity.</p>, <p>The list goes on, but the point is the same.</p>, <p>What I have proposed is a way to lower some of the most difficult costs families have to pay every month by asking big corporations -- 40 of the Fortune 500 companies paid zero in taxes; making $40 billion in the process -- and the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes.</p>, <p>Look, remember: We're in a situation that as far as Republicans are concerned, they'd rather the bills at your kitchen table be higher so the tax bills of corporate conference rooms and big mansions can be lower.</p>, <p>In this case, let me tell you something: Nothing will be more expensive for American families than a ""no"" vote on the Build Back Better plan.</p>, <p>I believe we simply can't afford to do nothing and wait and see what happens. In the moments we face today, that just isn't a responsible course.</p>, <p>We live in uncertain times. Families are anxious about COVID, the economy, the cost of living. And the way to relieve that anxiety is with consistent, determined, focused action.</p>, <p>I started my presidency with the American Rescue Plan. Now that law is carrying our nation forward on vaccinations, boosters, keeping our schools open, and so much more.</p>, <p>I designed it as a year-long plan because I knew we'd have a lot of obstacles to overcome.</p>, <p>Next, we passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law because a lot of our infrastructure is crumbling. We have to prepare ourselves to compete and win the 21st century global economy.</p>, <p>For most of the 20th century, we led the world in signif- -- by a significant margin because we invested in ourselves -- not only in our roads and highways and bridges, but in our people and our families.</p>, <p>We built the Interstate Highway System. We invested to win the space race. We were among the first to provide access to free education, beginning back in the late 1800s. These decisions to invest in our country and our families are a major reason why we were able to lead the world for much of the last century.</p>, <p>But somewhere along the way, we stopped investing in ourselves. America is still the largest economy in the world. We still have the most productive workers and the most innovative minds in the world.</p>, <p>But we've risked losing our edge as a nation. Our infrastructure used to be the best in the world. Today, according to the World Economic Forum, we rank 13th.</p>, <p>And we have to invest in our greatest asset as well: our people. For example, we used to lead the world in educational achievement. Now, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ranks America 35 out of 37 major countries when it comes to investing in early childhood education and care.</p>, <p>We can't be competitive in the 21st century global economy if we continue to slide.</p>, <p>One of the reasons I believe so firmly in this is because I know what this country can be. We've always been a nation of possibilities. We didn't become this nation we know by dreaming small. Throughout our history, we've emerged from crisis by investing in ourselves.</p>, <p>During and after the wa- -- the Civil War, we built the transcontinental railroad, uniting America.</p>, <p>During the Cold War, we built the Interstate Highway and -- System, transforming the way Americans are able to live their lives.</p>, <p>And now, we'll build the economy for the 21st century.</p>, <p>I truly believe that 50 years from now, when historians look back at this moment they're going to say this was the beginning of the moment when America won the competition for the 21st century. I think that's what we're going to see happen, God willing.</p>, <p>May God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you very much.</p>, <p>Q: Mr. President, what's your level of concern that the new variant will end up exacerbating the very issues on supply chains your team has been working on the last several months?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, you know me; I'm an optimist. What we have seen so far does not guarantee that's the outcome. As a matter of fact, we're going to know in the next several weeks that -- just -- not only how transmissible disease is but how extensive it is, how dangerous it is, and what damage it does -- and, most importantly whether, the vaccines we have are capable of dealing with this virus, particularly if the boosters we're trying to get everyone to get.</p>, <p>So, I think the jury is still out. I think it's a little early to make that judgment. But am I concerned? Of course I am until we get the final answers.</p>, <p>I'll take couple more questions. Yes.</p>, <p>Q: Mr. President, what is your reaction -- the Supreme Court heard the abortion case today and the Justices signaled that they're on the verge of major changes to abortion law in the United States. Do you have any plans to try to clarify the law? What is your reaction to that?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I haven't -- I didn't see any of the debate today -- or just the presentation today. And I support Roe v. Wade. I think it's a rational position to take, and I continue to support it.</p>, <p>Q: Mr. President, thank you so much. There are a number of Presidents, from Jimmy Carter to Richard Nixon, who really tried to impact inflation and supply chains and weren't able to largely do that. How confident are you that you have the tools and the power to do something about supply chains that help Americans find some relief?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Because what I've seen so far, based on what we've done -- this is the first time I've seen where labor and business is so ready to cooperate, because they didn't go through a period of a year -- over two years almost -- of the impacts of a terrible virus that has caused real damage to the world economy.</p>, <p>So, I think people are in a different state of mind than they may have been during the Carter years, as well as the Nixon years. It's just a different world.</p>, <p>Q: Mr. President, Mark Meadows has written a book revealing that President Trump tested positive for COVID three days before your first debate. Do you think the former President put you at risk?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: I don't think about the former President.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>]"

The sooner, the better.</p>, <p>Q: Mr. President, are you considering any new vaccine requirements or efforts to try to get more Americans vaccinated? You said that is the key to protecting against Omicron. Is there anything you're going to do?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: I'll -- I'll be talking about that on Thursday.</p>, <p>Q: Anything you can preview for us?</p>, <p>Q: Mr. President, are you planning to go to Michigan to talk to the families?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: I don't know that I'm able to do that. I don't even have the detail of who the families are. Although, I was talking to Debbie Dingell -- she was talking to me about it. And I think she knew somebody who was there. I'm not -- I don't know anybody who was injured. But she was telling -- talking about it.</p>, <p>So I don't have the detail. I don't have the detail.</p>, <p>Q: Mr. President, how long will the travel restrictions on countries in Southern Africa be in place?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, it kind of depends. I -- it's going week to week here to determine what we need and what the state of affairs. We're going to learn a lot more in the next couple of weeks about the lethality of this virus, about how much it spreads, about whether what we have can control it, et cetera. So it will depend on those -- those issues.</p>, <p>Q: Are you committed to telling the Allies if you have to impose further travel restrictions? When the -- President Trump instituted the travel restrictions, it was a real shock to European Allies. Are you committed to -- I mean, are you committed to sort of coordinating that?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Unlike Trump, I don't shock our Allies.</p>]"
0,6,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in Rosemount, Minnesota",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-rosemount-minnesota,"[<p>THE PRESIDENT: Whoa. (Laughter.) Sarah, thank you for that introduction.</p>, <p>I was saying to Sarah in the back, because I -- when I was Sarah's age, the idea that I'd be standing, waiting to introduce a President -- it didn't matter who it was -- I would find it a little daunting. And I was trying to reassure her, but obviously she didn't need any reassurance whatsoever. (Laughter.) Zero.</p>, <p>And thank you for your service to the United States military. (Applause.)</p>, <p>Governor, thanks for the welcome to Minnesota. I was telling the governor on the way -- on the ride here from the airport that I started coming to Minnesota back in 1973 because one of my mentors -- for real, one of -- it ended up being two -- was Hubert Humphrey.</p>, <p>When I -- he helped me campaign in 1972 as a 29-year-old candidate for the United States Senate in my home state of Delaware, and he gave me credibility I'm not sure I deserve, but it helped a great deal.</p>, <p>And after I got elected, there was a -- before I was -- I wasn't old enough to be sworn in. I had to wait to be eligible. You had to be 30 years old to be sworn in. Your constituents can elect you at any age, but you can't be sworn in until you're 30.</p>, <p>And while I was in Washington, making sure that I was hiring my staff, I got a phone call from my fire department saying there been an accident. And the poor woman they put on the phone had to say -- she just blurted out, ""Your wife and daughter are dead, and your kids won't make it."" My wife was Christmas shopping and was broadsided by a tractor trailer.</p>, <p>My point about it is that one of the first persons to come to me were the Humphreys -- not just the senator. And then a guy, who became a great friend and mentor was Fritz Mondale, as well.</p>, <p>So, I've been from the Iron Range all the way down to your southern -- southeastern border, and it's an incredible state, and you've elected some incredible people, including the people you heard from earlier today, which I'll speak to a little bit in a minute.</p>, <p>The -- I see a lot of mayors are here. And, you know, I told you that's the toughest job in America. They know where you live. (Laughter.) But it really is. You affect people's lives more than anybody else directly, and you're right there. So, thank you for what you do.</p>, <p>And from my administration, I also have the Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona, who is with us today. (Applause.) We served in Congress for a long time, and I'm delighted -- I'm delighted for him being here.</p>, <p>Before I get into my remarks in any detail, I was informed -- after the tour, I learned about a school shooting in Michigan. We learned -- well, as we learn the full details, my heart goes out to the families enduring the unimaginable grief of losing a loved one. Apparently, there are somewhere in the order of nine people shot and several -- or three, I think, are dead.</p>, <p>And the young man, I think -- as I understand it from staff -- was about 15 years old, and he turned himself in. And just said he -- and he claimed his right against self-incrimination and handed over his pistol. That's all that we know about it. But you've got to know that that whole community has to be just in a state of shock right now.</p>, <p>But look, one of the things that I want to mention is I want to tell you about the infrastructure law I signed on Thanksgiving. And it would not be possible -- and this is not hyperbole -- without the Minnesota congressional delegation.</p>, <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar was a leader on many issues. Her colleagues looked to her on everything from lowering the cost of prescription drugs to how to get broadband to the whole country. And Senator Klobuchar and I have been friends for a while. She knows how to work across the aisle and make progress. It's a big deal. (Inaudible.) (Applause.)</p>, <p>And not only do her colleagues call for advice, her President calls for advice. (Laughter.) And you know that's true.</p>, <p>And Senator Tina Smith, she's also led on making sure that Minnesotans and all Americans get access -- access to high-speed Internet. Senator Smith is making sure that the infrastructure and Build Back Better investments are going to help fight both the causes and the effects of climate change. And -- (applause).</p>, <p>And Representative Angie Craig, who I'm going to get to ride home with -- she's going to get on Air Force One when we're going back. (Laughter.) I'm going to spend a little time with her. She had a better means of transportation getting out of here. I don't know what it was, but -- (laughter).</p>, <p>But all kidding aside, I -- we've worked -- she's worked on the infrastructure law. She constantly reminds us that it's places like Dakota County, and it's connecting people to jobs and opportunities. And that's why Angie has always been the champion of schools like DCTC and investments in roads and bridges and high-speed Internet. (Applause.)</p>, <p>And Representative Dean Phillips. Dean, where are you? Dean -- from the very beginning, Dean has led getting bipartisan support to get this deal done. And you'd think this would be a slam dunk, but we did it without all but a few Republicans being able to come across and vote for it. But thank you for the work you did, Dean. I really mean it. (Applause.)</p>, <p>And Betty McCollum -- Betty has been fighting for a strong infrastructure package for more than a little bit of time. There you are, Betty.</p>, <p>And -- but I also want to acknowledge a few other people who couldn't be here today. Your Attorney General Ellison is such a fighter for justice. And Representative Omar --</p>, <p>Is he here?</p>, <p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Oh, okay. I was going to say, I totally would've -- reminded us that we all need to invest in our people, in universal pre-K, and affordable childcare.</p>, <p>Look, here's what this is all about: rebuilding America, getting this done -- no. Rebuilding America, investing in America -- that's what this is about. And we're doing it as we continue to battle the pandemic.</p>, <p>As I told the American people yesterday, this new variant is a cause of concern but not a cause to panic.</p>, <p>On Thursday, I'll put forward a detailed strategy outlining how we've gone -- we're going to fight this COVID this winter not with shutdowns and lockdowns, but with more widespread vaccinations, boosters, testing, and much more. (Applause.)</p>, <p>In the meantime -- in the meantime, the best protection is getting fully vaccinated -- (applause) -- getting a booster shot. I urge all Americans who haven't yet to get that done. Get it done today.</p>, <p>We're going to keep fighting through this with every tool we have, and we are -- you know, as we did with the original virus and with the Delta virus -- variant.</p>, <p>And we're also going to keep our historic economic growth moving. One of the ways we're going to do that is with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that we signed into law two weeks ago.</p>, <p>Over the next several weeks, I'm going to be traveling all over the country and so will Vice President Harris and my Cabinet and folks throughout this -- our administration to show how these investments are going to change your lives -- change lives for the better.</p>, <p>Because we know that we can't just build back to what it was before. And that used to be the rule. If anything got wiped out by a weather event, you were able to build back that road at exactly the specifications it was before. But you can't now because the climate is not going to get better. It's -- hopefully, we're not going to get worse. But you're going to have to build that road a couple of feet higher. You can't build it back to what it was. You can't replace those high-powerlines that come down with the same kind of construction. They have to be built so they're more resilient.</p>, <p>So that's what I mean when I say, ""Build back better."" It's necessary.</p>, <p>And the -- you know, schools like DCTC are going to help us do just that.</p>, <p>In places like this, we're going to train the next generation of workers to do the jobs that my infrastructure law and our Build Back Better Act are going to put into even greater demand. We're going to need more qualified people.</p>, <p>And we're talking about students learning how to repair electric vehicles and battery drivetrains, which are -- major auto manufacturers say -- will be 40 to 50 percent of all vehicles in the United States of America by the year 2030; becoming line workers we'll need to have to modernize our electrical grid and the commercial electricians who can help us install 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations we're going to put in, including along the highways we're building, so you never have to worry about running out of power. You'll be able to trav- -- (applause).</p>, <p>Training as construction managers to oversee all phases of construction projects we're going to be seeing all across Minnesota, like the Twin Port Interchange and -- Ports Interchange in Duluth and the Link project in Rochester.</p>, <p>These are the jobs of today and tomorrow. We're going to help America win the competition for the 21st century. We're getting back in the game.</p>, <p>In the better part of the 20th century -- for the better part, we led the world by a significant margin because we invested in ourselves and our people.</p>, <p>We invested in our infrastructure -- in our roads, our highways, our bridges, our ports, our airports -- the arteries of our nation that allow commerce to function smoothly and move swiftly.</p>, <p>And we've –- we've -- we invested in our people. We invested in opportunity in the past. But we're among -- we were among the first to provide access to free education in the late 1800s, early 1900s, which had us leap ahead of the rest of the world –- the first nation in the world with universal education.</p>, <p>We invested to win the space race.</p>, <p>We led the world in research and development that led to the creation of the Internet.</p>, <p>And -- but somewhere along the way, we stopped investing. And we're at risk of losing our edge as a nation to China and the rest of the world that's catching up and surpassing us in some areas.</p>, <p>Our infrastructure used to be rated the best in the world –- not hyperbole. It was rated the best in the world. But according to the World Economic Forum, we now rank 13th in the world in terms of the quality of our infrastructure.</p>, <p>And we're turning things around in a big way now. It starts with roads and bridges.</p>, <p>In 2007, this sate [sic] –- this state sounded the national alarm of our decaying infrastructure when the I-35 bridge collapsed, killing 13 people and injuring another 140. In the United States of America, a major bridge on a highway collapsed. This is America, for God's sake.</p>, <p>And we know about our infrastructure problems; we've known for a long time. Now we're finally doing something about it. No more talking. Time for action. (Applause.) Time for action.</p>, <p>Folks, this law makes significant investments in our roads and bridges in –- the largest investment in nearly 70 years -- (applause) -- fixing so many of the 661 bridges and nearly 5,000 miles of highway here in Minnesota –- just Minnesota -- that are in poor condition.</p>, <p>Those decaying roads cost Minnesota drivers an extra $543 a year in gas, repairs, and longer commute times –- every family. That's 543 hidden dollars in hidden taxes for Minnesota families.</p>, <p>And by the way, we might even be able to get something done fixing County Road 42 train crossing. (Laughter.)</p>, <p>We have one in Delaware -- (applause) -- we have a train crossing what used to be the General Motors plant. I've counted as many 142 cars sitting there for about 10 hours waiting to cross. No way out.</p>, <p>Look, this law includes the most significant investment in passenger rail in the past 50 years -- (applause) -- and in public transportation ever -- ever.</p>, <p>And here in Minnesota, it means replacing transit vehicles that are past their useful life, switching from diesel to electric, getting more people where they have to go safter [sic] -- safer, faster, and cleaner.</p>, <p>And it means more projects like the Orange Line, which is having its grand opening on Saturday, and is connecting communities along I-35 West with bus rapid transit, making it easier and faster to commute from Burnsville to Bloomberg [sic] to -- excuse me -- to Bloomington to Richville to major job centers in downtown Minnesota -- Minneapolis, Minnesota; to corporate headquarters like U.S. Bank and Best Buy and Target.</p>, <p>It's going to change things.</p>, <p>This law invests $42 billion to modernize our ports and our airports -- the Port of Duluth is the largest port in the Great Lakes -- or the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport, one of the busiest airports in the Midwest -- making it easier for companies to get goods to market, reducing supply chain bottlenecks, lowering costs for families, making sure that what you need gets to your ships, your trucks and trains, and eventually to your home on time.</p>, <p>Of course, that's not all this law achieves. The law will start to replace 100 percent of the nation's lead pipes in the United States and American service lines. (Applause.)</p>, <p>A recent survey estimated there are 260,000 or more lead pipelines here in Minnesota -- just Minnesota.</p>, <p>And we'll help communities like Coates build connections to water treatment facilities so every single child in Minnesota and across America can turn on the faucet and drink clean water -- (applause) -- without their parents worrying about how ""forever chemicals"" -- you ever think you'd hear that phrase 20 years ago, ""forever chemicals""? -- are in the ground and how they're impacting on the health and well-being of the population.</p>, <p>Folks, this is the United States of America, for God's sake. This is long overdue.</p>, <p>We're going to need tens of thousands of plumbers and pipefitters to do the work. And they'll get paid a prevailing wage with benefits -- (applause) -- and the ability to build a middle-class life.</p>, <p>The law is going to make high-speed Internet affordable and available everywhere in America, and create jobs laying down the broadband lines.</p>, <p>Today, 12 percent of Minnesotans and households don't have Internet subscriptions. And in some places, there's no broadband infrastructure at all.</p>, <p>This law is going to make high-speed Internet affordable and available everywhere in Minnesota -- (applause) -- urban, suburban, and rural -- over $20 billion.</p>, <p>In the 21st century in America, no parent ever should have to sit outside a fast food restaurant to be able to hook up to the Internet so their child can do their homework online. Think about that.</p>, <p>The law also builds up our resilience against extreme weather events, which Minnesota is no stranger to, like wildfires this summer in Superior National Forest that sent smoke into the Twin Cities; and tornadoes that touched down in -- in Burnsville and Apple Valley in September; or the heavy rains that have closed roads and contaminated wells in this area in the past.</p>, <p>Nationally -- nationally, last year, extreme weather cost the United States government $99 billion -- just last year.</p>, <p>I was out when -- those forest fires out in California and Nevada and that area, and it's astounding. More timber and homes and businesses have been burnt to the ground this past fire season than the entire square miles of the state of New Jersey, from New York City all the way down to Cape May. That's how much burned to the ground. Nothing there. I flew over it in helicopters. Nothing.</p>, <p>And you see reservoirs down 40, 50, 60 feet. Worrying about whether the Colorado River is going to continue to flow. This is just dire stuff, but all within our capacity to deal with.</p>, <p>This law builds back our bridges, our water systems, our powerlines, our electric grids better and stronger, more resilient and resistant to the negative impacts and effects of climate change so fewer Americans will be flooded out of their homes or lose power for days and weeks after a storm.</p>, <p>Down in Louisiana -- I have with me -- who now works with me and handles a big chunk of what I have to do -- former Chairman of the Black Caucus in the Congress, Cedric Richmond. (Applause.)</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Cedric had me down -- down in Louisiana, in New Orleans. That storm -- that hurricane that went through had high wind peak at 178 miles per hour.</p>, <p>But you know what? When I went from there up to North Jersey and New York, more people died in Man- -- in Queens, Manhattan because of 20 inches of rain falling and their basements flooding so they couldn't get out. More people died there than did in the hurricane in New Orleans.</p>, <p>Folks, there's so much more in the law. Most of all, this law does something truly historic. It's going to help rebuild the backbone in this nation: working people and the middle class.</p>, <p>When I ran for President I said I was running for three reasons. One, to restore the soul of the country -- to have some -- restore some decency in how we dealt with one another. (Applause.) And two -- and two, to rebuild the backbone of the country: hardworking, middle-class folks and working-class folks who built the country.</p>, <p>Folks on Wall Street aren't bad, but they didn't build America. The people who work -- coming out of this school are the ones who built America. They built America, and they've been left behind for much too long.</p>, <p>We're going to rebuild this economy from the bottom up and the middle out. (Applause.)</p>, <p>I've never known -- I've never known a time when the middle class has done well that the very wealthy haven't done very, very well. I'm not being solicitous. I'm being deadly earnest. But I'm tired of this trickle-down economy. I'm tired of it.</p>, <p>This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America. And the only way this works is if the blue-collar Americans do the building. And that's the only way it's ever worked. And we are going to do it again. Mark my words. Mark my words.</p>, <p>The same goes for my plan to Build Back Better for our people.</p>, <p>For example, the cost of a two-year degree in Minnesota is nearly $6,000 a year. Over a third of the students at DCTC receive Pell Grants.</p>, <p>My Build Back Better plan is going to increase the maximum Pell Grant award by another $550 -- (applause) -- to make it -- to make it more affordable.</p>, <p>We're going to invest an unprecedented $10 billion in job training programs at a school like -- schools like this one; and expand registered apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeship programs. And -- (applause).</p>, <p>And, very importantly, this bill will deliver universal preschool to every three- and four-year-old in America. (Applause.)</p>, <p>Folks, one study found that the low-income children participating in a preschool program were 47 percent more likely to go on and earn an associate or a higher degree after going through 12 years of school, without problems.</p>, <p>We have to build the foundation for success. My wife, Jill, is a community college professor and has been for some time. She always points out: Any nation that out-educates us is going to outcompete us. It's a simple proposition.</p>, <p>Look what the rest of the world is doing. Look at what the rest of the world is doing. China is investing billions of dollars in early education. I can go down the list.</p>, <p>Look, this Build Back Better plan is also going to ensure that parents can afford childcare and that childcare -- (applause) -- and that childcare workers can actually get a raise and -- a raise they deserve -- and more education.</p>, <p>If you're paying $14,000 for childcare, like a lot of Minnesota families do, my Build Back Better plan is going to make a giant difference in your life because your childcare costs will not be -- will be capped at 7 percent of your income -- 7 percent. That's it. (Applause.) Seven percent of your income.</p>, <p>That's going to make a huge difference for the economy overall, but for millions of workers who had to drop out of the workforce not because they wanted to, but because they couldn't find available childcare -- especially the 2 million women who left the workforce during this COVID crisis.</p>, <p>If you're one of the millions of Americans paying too much for insulin, my Build Back Better plan is going to change that as well, because we're going to lower prescription drug costs. And that means you won't pay more than $35 a month for your insulin. It's important not only from a health standpoint, but from a standpoint of personal dignity.</p>, <p>Imagine if you're a parent of one of the 200,000 children in this country with Type 1 diabetes needing that insulin. Insulin can cost as much as $1,000 a month. If you can't afford it, it's not only a health risk, but it deprives a parent of their dignity. It deprives them of their dignity, of your ability to do one thing every parent wants and deserves to be able to do: to say to their child -- to look them in the eye and say, ""Honey, it's going to be okay."" Imagine not being able to say that.</p>, <p>And, by the way, we're not artificially reducing that cost. It costs $35 for the insulin when it was first invented and patented. They've done not a single thing since then to improve it; it's good. And now, it costs $1,000?</p>, <p>Folks, lowering the cost of childcare, eldercare, housing, healthcare, prescription drugs, and meeting the moment on climate change -- that's what this plan does.</p>, <p>Frankly, I'm surprised that not a single Republican in Congress has joined us in supporting it. It can't be because it would add to inflation. Seventeen Nobel laureates -- seventeen -- three weeks ago, spontaneously sent me a letter saying that it would have the opposite effect; it would actually reduce long-term inflationary pressures.</p>, <p>It can't be because it would add to the deficit, because it reduces the deficit over the long term.</p>, <p>It can't be because it's fiscally responsible, because it's fully paid for. It's fully paid for. (Applause.) No one -- no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a single penny more in federal taxes.</p>, <p>Fifty-five percent -- and I come from the corporate state of America, Delaware. More corporations are incorporated in Delaware than every other nation and every other -- excuse me -- state in the nation. And guess what? Fifty-five percent of the Fortune 500 companies -- the largest ones -- paid zero in income taxes last year after making $40 billion in profits.</p>, <p>I'm a capitalist. If you can make a million or a billion dollars, have at it. Just pay your fair share. (Applause.) That's all I'm asking.</p>, <p>That's why the Build Back Better plan has a minimum tax that makes sure that large, profitable corporations start paying their fair share. And we got passed, internationally, a provision that a 15 percent minimum is paid in every single country so you don't have countries fleeing here with technology to go other places because they have a lower tax rate.</p>, <p>The first major piece of legislation in more than a decade -- and it's not only fully paid for. Based on official estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Treasury Department, it's going to generate more than $100 billion in deficit reduction this decade.</p>, <p>So, look, I know some people have said this bill isn't fiscally responsible enough. Because even though it's fully paid for, they acknowledge; even though it would reduce the deficit, which they acknowledge; even though it represents the first time in over a decade that we're doing the hard work of offsetting investments with new revenue, some of the programs may get extended. And if they get extended, they say, it's going to cost more money. We didn't count that in.</p>, <p>Well, that's true. Congress is going to pay for those as well. After years of Republican leadership in Washington passing tax giveaways to the super-wealthy, new spending without even giving a thought about how to pay for it -- they added $8 trillion to the national debt with the Trump tax cut -- $8 trillion.</p>, <p>I welcome a serious conversation about how to pay for the investments we make, but here is what those critics are not telling you. They're not telling you that I've committed to paying for every single program that extended, if any are, in future legislation, whether that's for a day or a decade.</p>, <p>And here's what else they're not telling you. They're not telling you why it is that they're fighting so hard against lowering the prices of prescription drugs or childcare or eldercare or healthcare; why it is that they're so frightened, so hard to -- fighting so incredibly hard to protect the 2017 Trump tax cuts that increase the deficit alone by nearly $2 trillion -- the bulk of which went to large corporations and virtually none of it paid for. I'm happy to have that debate about how to pay for these priorities.</p>, <p>In my Build Back Better plan, we're already undoing some of the most reckless elements of the Trump tax bill, like ending the tax breaks for companies sending jobs overseas. We've got a -- we got a tax cut for sending a job overseas.</p>, <p>(Inaudible) tax giveaways in the bill that expire. That bill expires in 2025; it has to be reauthorized. For example, the tax rate for the 1 percent wealthiest Americans used to be 39.6 percent. You make it sound -- they make it sound like it used to be 70 percent or something -- 39.6 percent, what it was in the Bush administration.</p>, <p>The Trump tax cut cut that to 37 percent. Just by restoring that tax back to 39.7 -- what it was in the Bush years -- just by doing that would generate an additional $20 billion a year in revenue -- enough to pay for universal preschool for all three- and four-year-olds, all the way through. (Applause.)</p>, <p>So, folks, we're going to face a choice. Do we keep giving tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent of the taxpayers or do we keep lowering costs for working families?</p>, <p>You know, we -- I think we have something like 730-some billionaires in America. That's fine. You make a billion dollars; I'm okay with that.</p>, <p>But you know what? You know how much money, when everybody was losing money during the recession -- the pre-recession -- you know how much money those 739, I think it is, made? Another trillion dollars. You hear me now?</p>, <p>Those 735 -- whatever the number is -- made an additional trillion dollars in that year and a half. Trillion. I didn't hear anybody weeping and gnashing their teeth -- (laughter) -- about any of that.</p>, <p>If they want to argue about continuing tax cuts for big corporations and the wealthiest Americans is more important than lowering the cost of childcare, lowering prescription drug prices -- that's an argument I'm happy to have. I'm looking forward to that debate.</p>, <p>One of the reasons I believe so firmly in the proposal is because I know what this country can be. We've always been a nation of possibilities.</p>, <p>I was asked by Xi Jinping -- I travel -- I spent, with him, more time than any other world leader. And I was in -- 17,000 miles with him in China. And he turned to me in one of our many one-on-one meetings -- with an interpreter, each -- and asked me -- he said, ""Can you define America for me?"" I said, ""Yeah."" I said, ""One word: possibilities.""</p>, <p>Think about it. No other nation in the world -- one of the reasons why we think we're (inaudible) America is no other nation in the world believes that anything we set our minds to, we can do. Because when we've done it, we've never failed.</p>, <p>Folks, we didn't become this nation we know by dreaming small. Throughout our history, we've emerged from crisis by investing in ourselves.</p>, <p>During and after the Civil War, we built -- during the Civil War, it started -- the Transcontinental Railroad, uniting the East Coast and the West Coast. During the Cold War, we built the Interstate Highway System -- transformed how Americans live their lives. And now we're going to build an economy of the 21st century.</p>, <p>I truly believe that 50 years from now -- and I mean this from the bottom of my heart -- historians are going to look back on this moment and the next several years, and they're going to say that this was the moment when America won the competition for the 21st century. Because if we don't, we're going to lose it. We going to lose it.</p>, <p>So, folks, there's nothing we can't do. When the American people set their mind to something, there's never been anything we cannot do. There's never been a crisis we've got into that we haven't come out stronger than before we went into it. That's who we are. That's America.</p>, <p>God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. And thanks for your patience. (Applause.)</p>]"
0,7,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on Signing Veterans Bills,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-veterans-bills,"[<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think it's still morning. Good morning, everyone. Please --</p>, <p>AUDIENCE: Good morning.</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: -- please be seated. I feel like we have a quorum in the House. (Laughter.) I miss the quorums.</p>, <p>Vice President Harris, honored guests: I want to thank you all for being here.</p>, <p>Secretary McDonough, thank you for your work to ensure that the VA provides world-class care and support for those who bore the battle.</p>, <p>In a moment, I'm going to have the honor of signing into law four bills that the women and men in this room had -- have written and gotten passed -- bipartisan bills to honor one truly sacred obligation we have as a nation. We have many obligations, but we only have one truly sacred obligation, in my view, and that is prepare those we send into harm's way, care for their families when they're gone, and care for them and their families when they're home.</p>, <p>And that's a -- that's a lifetime commitment -- a lifetime commitment the nation owes to every one of our veterans, and it's one that I embrace as Commander-in-Chief. For me, for Jill, and for the entire Biden family, it's also personal. And it's a commitment that we are helping to keep today because of the leadership of the women and men in this room.</p>, <p>The first bill I will sign requires the Government Accounting [Accountability] Office to assess whether there are disparities associated with race and ethnicity when it comes to VA benefits and disability ratings.</p>, <p>The weapons of war and the nature of the injuries they inflict don't differentiate based on race. And the types of disabilities our veterans carry with them don't differentiate based on race. So, the claims approved and the benefits delivered should not differentiate either.</p>, <p>We've heard from veterans of color who, upon returning home from their service, are treated differently from white veterans.</p>, <p>This bill will help us understand how this happened, keep better records, expose the facts to the light of day, and allow us to do the necessary work of making sure that all of our nation's veterans -- all of them -- are treated with equal dignity and equal equality throughout their entire time, with the consideration being no different for -- based on race.</p>, <p>And I want to thank and congratulate Senator Warnock, who is here in the room, who has such a -- has been a moral leader in the U.S. Senate since he got here and leading on this issue; as well as Representative Takano, who has done a yeoman's work in the House.</p>, <p>The second bill I'll sign is the Hire Veterans Health Heroes Act.</p>, <p>I want to thank Senator Hassan and Senator Braun, and Representatives Rice and Latta for their work to help veterans find a way to continue to serve their country.</p>, <p>In 2019, the Inspector General of the VA reported that staff shortages are one of the causes of the many problems we face in veterans' care.</p>, <p>And at the same time, with our military, there are nearly 200,000 dedicated, well-trained workers in nearly every area of healthcare -- doctors, nurses, pharmacists, technicians, and physical therapists.</p>, <p>They understand the health challenges our women and men in uniform face. One thousand -- actually, 13,000 of them are separated from active duty every single year. And we can do more by helping the separated service members with backgrounds in healthcare continue their work in healthcare in the federal government at places like the VA.</p>, <p>This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to create a program to recruit military medical personnel who have less than a year left in their service to work in federal healthcare occupations.</p>, <p>This new program will build upon existing efforts to create a pipeline for former military health professionals. For both our veterans and our military medical personnel, service isn't just what they do, it's who they are.</p>, <p>This bill is going to allow those professionals to continue their service to each other and to our nation.</p>, <p>And the third bill I will sign is the Colonel John M. McHugh Tuition Fairness and [for] Survivors Act.</p>, <p>For so many of our service members, their service to us is also about building a better life for themselves and for their families. And part of keeping our commitment to them means helping survivors get the education they need and to fulfill their dreams.</p>, <p>This law -- this law ensures that surviving spouses and children of veterans who access the Survivors' and Dependents' Education Assistance program are eligible for in-state tuition wherever they choose to go to school, whether they live in that state or not.</p>, <p>I want to recognize Senator Tester and Moran, Representatives Trone and Moore for their work they've done on this bill.</p>, <p>I also want to recognize a very special guest, Kelly McHugh Stewart. Kelly, where are you? Kelly, thank you for being here. Thank you for being here. And the -- she is the daughter of Colonel John M. McHugh. For being here today, I want to thank her.</p>, <p>Kelly, your dad was an American hero, but he wasn't the only one in the family who is a hero. Your work -- your work to share your story, to advocate for other surviving families, and to turn loss into progress and understanding is heroic as well. So, we thank you for it. Really, thank you, personally.</p>, <p>The final bill I'll sign today is the Protecting Moms Who Served Act. The Senate was -- and this -- and in the Senate, it was championed by Senator Tammy Duckworth -- a mom, a veteran, a senator -- and Senator Susan Collins.</p>, <p>And it also was one of the pet projects that the Vice President had when she was a United States senator, and it sticks with her. I don't know how many times I've heard about what we have to do -- and she's right.</p>, <p>In the House, it was championed by a former nurse, Representative Lauren Underwood, and Representative Bil- -- Bilirakis.</p>, <p>And our -- and our country continues to have the highest maternal mortality rates in the developed world, which is hard -- it's just -- especially among Black and Native American women.</p>, <p>For many years, President -- Vice President Harris has led the fight to address this tragedy of maternal morali- -- mor- -- maternal mortality in our nation.</p>, <p>Her efforts in the Senate are reflected in our Build Back Better framework and our investments in maternal health.</p>, <p>We're going to help expand and diversify the maternal health workforce, improve mental -- improve maternal mental health, and bolster community-based programs, train providers, enhance research, and ensure -- ensure maternal care is coordinated.</p>, <p>As we continue that work, we recognize that women veterans -- and there are more than half a million women veterans in this country under the age of 40 -- they face additional maternal health challenges.</p>, <p>They frequently have other health risks that can complicate pregnancy. For example, expecting moms with physical disabilities or with mental illness are much more likely to experience pregnancy-related complications and have their children prematurely.</p>, <p>This bill will commission a comprehensive study of maternal health challenges facing veterans and will invest in maternal care coordination programs at the VA.</p>, <p>It's an important step in making sure we meet the needs of American mothers who have served.</p>, <p>Earlier this month, I commemorated Veterans Day at Arlington National Cemetery. On that solemn day, we lay a wreath and renew our oath.</p>, <p>But keeping faith with American veterans requires much more than laying wreaths or making more oaths. It requires acts. That's what you've done today -- all of you -- acts. That's why I'm so proud to sign these bills.</p>, <p>May God bless you. And may God protect our troops and their families.</p>, <p>And now I'd like to invite the folks to the stage as I sign the first bill. Thank you very much. Thank you.</p>, <p>(The bills are signed.)</p>]"
0,8,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks During a Meeting with CEOs of Companies to Discuss the Holiday Shopping Season,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-during-meeting-with-ceos-companies-discuss-the-holiday-shopping-season,"[<p>THE PRESIDENT: All right. If I can get my pages unstuck here, we're ready. I'm going to take my mask off when I speak here.</p>, <p>First of all, thanks for joining us today. I really appreciate it. I know how incredibly busy you all are and the heck of a job you're doing to make sure people aren't disappointed this past Thanksgiving, as well as Christmas coming up.</p>, <p>This morning, I provided an update on the Omicron variant and told the American people that it is a -- the new variant is cause for concern, but not a cause for panic. And we're going to fight this with science and speed. We're not going to fight it with chaos and confusion. And we believe we can deal with it.</p>, <p>On Thursday, I'm going to be putting forward a detailed strategy on how to deal with this new variant. And that is not shutdowns or lockdowns, but with more widespread vaccination and more boosters, testing, and -- and more.</p>, <p>In the meantime, I've said the best protection against this new variant is to get fully vaccinated and get a booster shot. And I urge all Americans who haven't yet done that: Get it done today. There's no excuse. We have over 80,000 places you can get it done. I mean, there's just -- there's no reason. It's free. It's available. And if you qualify for the booster, get it done today.</p>, <p>And now to the business at hand: I know it's been an incredibly busy time for all of you here today, and -- and that's a very good thing, from my perspective. But then again, I'm not doing all the work you all are doing. (Laughter.) But all kidding aside, it really -- it really matters.</p>, <p>I remember -- and I think we all do -- last year: families celebrating the holidays apart from one another or on a video or -- for fear of spreading a deadly virus.</p>, <p>And this year, thanks to scientists, researchers, and doctors who developed the COVID-19 vaccines, and the nurses and other frontline workers who saw to it that it was administered -- many of them your employees in your stores, who were able to have a very different Thanksgiving as a consequence of that than last Thanksgiving -- reunited with friends and family and I think, maybe the most important, with a little more hope -- a little more hope.</p>, <p>And fewer Americans were worried about putting food on the table. And hunger is actually down 40 percent this year in the United States of America.</p>, <p>4.5 million more Americans than last year had the dignity of a job.</p>, <p>What it also means is that as we're looking toward the holiday season, we feel a lot more like the ones we had in the past.</p>, <p>Consumer spending has recovered to where it was headed before the pandemic. Early estimates are that Black Friday sales were up nearly a third since last year and in-store sales were up by nearly -- by more -- even more than that. I believe it was 40-some percent by –- I don't have the number on top -- I think it was 44 percent -- something like that.</p>, <p>And -- and so, we're hearing similar reports from Small Business Saturday. I don't have those numbers yet.</p>, <p>And I'm sure that some of the people watching this online are also doing a little Cyber Monday shopping right now.</p>, <p>And that's why I brought everyone together today, and thank you for accommodating it.</p>, <p>The business leaders who are gathered here today represent a broad swath of American shopping: brick-and-mortar and online stores, national and local grocery chains, our nation's largest retailer, and makers and sellers of toys, electronics, and health supplies.</p>, <p>I want to hear from each of you about what you're seeing this holiday season; how well prepared are you to and -- to have products you need on your shelves; and, you know, how you've innovated and hired to overcome the supply chain challenges you have; and kept workers safe from COVID-19 so that the American people can have a holiday season that they've been long hoping for.</p>, <p>In particular, I want to hear about the challenges facing smaller businesses. The small businesses are so important to our communities. They don't have the same leverage as many of you do.</p>, <p>And finally, I want to hear your ideas on how the federal government can continue partnering with you all to keep shelves stocked so American consumers can get what they need.</p>, <p>And some of you have been working with my port envoy, John Porcari, to get goods through our ports faster. And we've seen some progress in that effort with a number of containers sitting on docks for more than eight days -- down by over 40 percent this month. And we keep building on that progress.</p>, <p>And so, I'd like to start the conversation with -- Meg, with your permission -- by turning to Meg Ham, president of the Food Lion. Meg, food is, to state the obvious, a big part of the holiday season.</p>, <p>MS. HAM: Yes. (Laughs.)</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: And your grocery store chain has a large footprint. You're in 10 states with over 1,100 supermarkets. How did Thanksgiving go?</p>, <p>And, by the way, you're in my state as well.</p>, <p>And can -- can you tell me about your company's ability to get the products you need from your suppliers and on your store shelves? And just talk a little with me about what's going on.</p>, <p>MS. HAM: Sure, I can. And first of all, I'd like to say thank you for allowing us to come together today to talk about this very important topic. And certainly, the pandemic has had an impact, as you described, on how customers do their grocery shopping and what customers are buying when they do do their grocery shopping.</p>, <p>And, first and foremost, I'd like to say that our supply chain has -- is strong and robust.</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: All right.</p>, <p>MS. HAM: And we have ample product inside of our stores for customers to choose from during this holiday. However, they have changed their shopping patterns.</p>, <p>And this is our second Thanksgiving, as you mentioned, during the pandemic. And the holiday season is incredibly important as it relates to food, but I think also as it relates to our country and especially with Thanksgiving -- a time to come together to maintain traditions, to start new traditions, to maintain some sense of normalcy, and to move forward with hope, as you said.</p>, <p>And so, Thanksgiving is an incredibly important time for us. And I think, first and foremost, we started with an immense amount of planning to be ready for the business and for customers to be able to buy what they need to at our stores. And we worked very early with our vendor partners to get clear on our forecasts for the business and what we could do together, from a logistic standpoint, to ensure they had the supplies they needed, we had the supplies we needed to get to the customer. So, it was a great collaboration and partnership as we move forward.</p>, <p>So, whether it is everyday items or important items during these holiday times around fresh collards, where I'm located, or canned cranberry sauce, we worked very differently to figure out how to move the product, how to work with local farmers to get product directly to our stores to ensure customers had what they needed this holiday season.</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: How much working with local farmers is engaged in your -- in your operation?</p>, <p>MS. HAM: We have a large local program across all of our footprint, and it's an important part of our produce business specifically, and all across our store will we have local products.</p>, <p>So, we have strong partnerships across the store.</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: One last question --</p>, <p>MS. HAM: Okay.</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: -- I don't want to dominate this -- but what -- was there any one product that was harder to garner than others that was needed or -- not needed, but is -– you know, was looked for for Thanksgiving?</p>, <p>MS. HAM: There –- as you know, there are just so many that are special to individual people. And we know what they are, and we worked really hard to get all of them. And if we couldn't get one kind, we got another brand. And so --</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Gotcha.</p>, <p>MS. HAM: -- there wasn't one particular one; it was focused on being able to provide the special items during this time of year.</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, great. Glad you had a good -- are you looking forward to what -- you don't have any numbers or ideas of what you expect from Saturday or today on --</p>, <p>MS. HAM: We had a strong Thanksgiving holiday season and expect that that will continue into the Thanks- -- to the Christmas selling season as well.</p>, <p>We have our own supply chain, so we have our own distribution -–</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p>, <p>MS. HAM: -- logistics network that helps us work with our partners to move product.</p>, <p>And we also really appreciate the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act finalization that has helped move us forward and will substantially improve the roads and the bridges to help the seamless supply of product across our 10 st- -- our 10-state footprint.</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: It's interesting you mention it -- I think people underestimate just how out of sync our infrastructure has been for so long. And I think that people who live near that bridge that certain trucks can't go over or near that fire station where you have to go 10 miles around the creek to get -- because you can't go over the particular bridge or sidewalks, highways, et cetera. So, I'm looking forward to it being a lot better over the next couple years.</p>, <p>MS. HAM: Yeah. Good.</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: So –-</p>, <p>MS. HAM: We're planning for a great December holidays. And, it's planned already, so --</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: All right.</p>, <p>Doug, I know you run a small outfit –- (laughter) -- called Walmart. And I want to tell you something: I don't remember when you all -- it's not a question, but I'm just curious -- when you became the largest food retailer in the country.</p>, <p>And -- but I spent more time walking through the aisles of Walmart than I want to admit over my -– because there's one right down the street from where I live in Delaware.</p>, <p>Anyway, how are things looking for you this holiday season, Doug, and –- and across both retail and the grocery side? Walmart has been working closely with my team to clear bottlenecks at the -- and I really appreciate the help -- in the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.</p>, <p>Have you seen any progress in the ability of a company like yours to get boxes off the docks faster, get product from -- from the docks to your shelves, et cetera? Can you talk to me a little bit about that?</p>, <p>MR. MCMILLON: Yes, sir, I can. Thank you for the question and thank you for your partnership. And thanks for shopping in our stores.</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.)</p>, <p>MR. MCMILLON: I'd like to take the opportunity to also thank our associates because they're doing an outstanding job and have been through this whole period, and that continues up until this moment.</p>, <p>We think we're going to have a really good holiday season. We shared our earnings results a couple of weeks ago. And we told everybody that. And we shared that our inventory levels are up more than 10 percent.</p>, <p>So, while we're all concerned about the supply chain, we have more inventory than we did a year ago and have the inventory that we need to be able to support the business.</p>, <p>And we are seeing progress. The port and transit delays are improving. As you and I discussed not long ago, about two thirds of what we sell in the United States is made or grown here. That other third has a meaningful portion coming from Canada and Mexico, which is helpful.</p>, <p>For the part that comes outside of North America, the port issue has been a big issue. But we've really seen a lot of improvement.</p>, <p>Because of what you all did to help with overnight hours and because of the team's work to reroute to other ports, to extend our lead times, and have other creative solutions, we've seen an increase in throughput over the last four weeks of about 26 percent nationally in terms of getting containers through ports.</p>, <p>And in the Southern California ports in particular, where you've been really focused, we've seen a 51 percent improvement in that flow through --</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Wow.</p>, <p>MR. MCMILLON: -- and that's helped a lot as it relates to categories like toys, which are so important for Christmas.</p>, <p>So, we'll keep working to make sure that we're in a good in-stock position as we go all the way through the season. We do expect it to be strong. And there are a few items, as there are every year with the hottest toys or things in electronics, that we wish we had more of.</p>, <p>But generally speaking, we're in good shape and really appreciate the partnership.</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. You've been really -- really cooperative. I can't tell you how much we appreciate it.</p>, <p>And I was -– I was really pleased, quite frankly, and proud of the cooperation you saw between business and labor in the ports in Southern California.

MCMILLON: It takes all of us.</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: It sure as heck does.</p>, <p>All right. Well, I guess I'm going to turn this over now to -- to Brian. He's going to moderate the rest.

0,9,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the Omicron COVID-19 Variant and an Exchange with Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-omicron-covid-19-variant-and-exchange-with-reporters,"[<p>THE PRESIDENT: Good morning, folks. I hope you all had a happy Thanksgiving -– able to get together with your family and friends. And it was great to see so many families getting together this Thanksgiving after being apart last year. And we have much to be grateful for as a nation.</p>, <p>When I was elected, I said I would always be honest with you. So today, I want to take a few moments to talk about the new COVID variant first identified last week in Southern Africa. It's called the Omicron.</p>, <p>It is –- and to their credit, the scientific community in South Africa quickly notified the world of the emergence of this new variant. This kind of transparency is to be encouraged and applauded because it increases our ability to respond quickly to any new threats. And that's exactly what we did.</p>, <p>The very day the World Health Organization identified the new variant, I took immediate steps to restrict travel from countries in Southern Africa. But while we have -- that travel restrictions can slow the speed of Omicron, it cannot prevent it.</p>, <p>But here's what it does: It gives us time. It gives us time to take more actions, to move quicker, to make sure people understand you have to get your vaccine. You have to get the shot. You have to get the -- get the booster if you're -–</p>, <p>Sooner or later, we're going to see cases of this new variant here in the United States. We'll have to face this new threat just as we have faced those that have come before it.</p>, <p>Today, there are three messages about the new variant that I want the American people to hear.</p>, <p>First, this variant is a cause for concern, not a cause for panic. We have the best vaccine in the world, the best medicines, the best scientists. And we're learning more every single day.</p>, <p>And we'll fight this variant with scientific and knowledgeable actions, and speed -- not chaos and confusion. And we have more tools today to fight the variant than we've ever had before -- from vaccines to boosters, to vaccines for children five years and older, and much more.</p>, <p>A year ago, America was floundering against the first variant of COVID. We beat that variant significantly, and then we got hit by a far more powerful threat: the Delta variant. But we took action, and now we're seeing deaths from Delta come down. We'll fight the –- you know, and –- look, we're going to fight and beat this new variant as well.</p>, <p>We're learning more about this new variant every single day. And as we learn more, we're going to share that information with the American people candidly and promptly.</p>, <p>Second, the best protection –- I know you're tired of hearing me say this -- the best protection against this new variant or any of the –- of the variants out there -– the ones we've been dealing with already -- is getting fully vaccinated and getting a booster shot. Most Americans are fully vaccinated but not yet boosted.</p>, <p>If you're 18 years or over and got fully vaccinated before June the 1st, go get the booster shot today. They're free, and they're available at 80,000 locations coast to coast. A fully vaccinated boosted person is the most protected against COVID.</p>, <p>Do not wait. Go get your booster if it's time for you to do so.</p>, <p>And if you are not vaccinated, now is the time to get vaccinated and take your children to be vaccinated. Every child age five or older can get safe, effective vaccines now.</p>, <p>While it will be a few weeks before we know everything we need to know about how strongly the existing vaccines protect against the new variant -- Dr. Fauci, who is with me today -- of our medical team, and -- believe that the vaccines will continue to provide a degree of protection against severe disease.</p>, <p>And as an additional protections, please wear your masks when you're indoors in public settings, around other people. It protects you; it protects those around you.</p>, <p>Third, in the event -- hopefully unlikely -- that updated vaccinations or boosters are needed to respond to this new variant, we will accelerate their development and deployment with every available tool.</p>, <p>I want to reiterate: Dr. Fauci believes that the current vaccines provide at least some protection against the new variant and the boosters strengthen that protection significantly.</p>, <p>We do not yet believe that additional measures will be needed. But so that we are prepared if needed, my team is already working with officials at Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson to develop contingency plans for vaccines or boosters if needed.</p>, <p>And I will also direct the FDA and the CDC to use the fastest process available -- without cutting any corners for safety -- to get such vaccines approved and on the market if needed.</p>, <p>And we will do that the same way if -- any modifications are needed or current treatments need -- used to help those with -- who get ill with the COVID virus.</p>, <p>Look, I'm -- I'm sparing no effort and removing all roadblocks to keep the American people safe. All of this is confusing to a lot of people. But if it's confusing to you, let me close with this simple message: If you are vaccinated but still worried about the new variant, get your booster. If you aren't vaccinated, get that shot. Go get that first shot.</p>, <p>My team at the White House will provide me with daily updates this week. And on Thursday, I'll be putting forward a detailed strategy outlining how we're going to fight COVID this winter -- not with shutdowns or lockdowns but with more widespread vaccinations, boosters, testing, and more.</p>, <p>I promised every American that there will be -- always be the latest vaccines available and the booster shots available to them and for free and -- everywhere available. Every single American, free of charge -- and I will keep that commitment.</p>, <p>But we need to do more than vaccinate Americans. To beat the pandemic, we have to vaccinate the world as well. And America is leading that effort. We've shipped -- for free -- more vaccines to other countries than all other countries in the world combined: over 275 million vaccines to 110 countries.</p>, <p>Now we need the rest of the world to step up as well. Let me be clear: Not a single vaccine shot Americans ever send to the rest of the world will ever come at the expense of any American. I will always make sure that our people are protected first.</p>, <p>But vaccinating the world is just one more tool in how we need to meet our moral obligation as Americans and how to best protect Americans as well.</p>, <p>The Delta variants and now the Omicron variant all emerged elsewhere in the world. So we can't let up until the world is vaccinated. We're protecting Americans by doing that as well.</p>, <p>As we continue this effort, let's remember where we stand. We're in a very different place as we enter the month of December this month compared to where we were last -- last Sept- -- last Christmas.</p>, <p>Last Christmas, fewer than 1 percent of American adults were vaccinated. This Christmas, the number will be over 71 percent, including more than 86 percent of seniors.</p>, <p>Last Christmas, our children were at risk without a vaccine. This Christmas, we have safe and effective vaccines for children ages five and older, with more than 19 million children and counting now vaccinated.</p>, <p>Last year, a majority of schools were closed. This year, 99 percent of our schools are open. And let me reiterate once more: We also now have booster shots that provide extra protection. They are free and convenient. There is still time to get your first two shots or your booster shot or get your children vaccinated before Christmas. All three are available and can be done before Christmas.</p>, <p>If you and your family are fully vaccinated, you can celebrate the holidays much more safely. And given where we were last year, that's a blessing that none of us should take for granted.</p>, <p>We're throwing everything we can at this virus, tracking it from every angle. And that's what we have to keep doing. That's how we reopened our country. That's how we reopened our businesses. That's how we reopened our schools. That's how, even with a pandemic, we've generated a record job creation, a record economic growth in this country.</p>, <p>We've moved forward in the face of COVID-19. We have moved forward in the face of the Delta variant. And we will move forward now in the face of the Omicron variant as well.</p>, <p>So thank you. May God bless our troops. And I hope you all have -- I'll be speaking before then, but -- a Merry Christmas, as we approach it.</p>, <p>Questions.</p>, <p>Q: (Cross-talk.)</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Let me call on Nancy of Bloomberg.</p>, <p>Q: Thank you so much, President Biden. Do you think that other countries will be reluctant to report variants or other strains given the travel ban that you put so quickly on South Africa?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: No, I don't think so. I don't think that's what's going to happen. And I want to -- again, the reason for the immediate travel ban is there were a significant number of cases, unlike any other country -- well, the few around South Africa -- in the world.</p>, <p>We needed time to give people an opportunity to say, ""Get that vaccination now"" before it -- it's going to move around the world. I think it's almost inevitable there will be, at some point, that -- that strain here in the United States.</p>, <p>But I don't -- I don't think anyone is going to be reluctant to report.</p>, <p>We have also moved to do more. For example, we've provided more vaccines, as I said, than all other countries in the world combined. And we've provided significant vaccines as well to South Africa and that region. As a matter of fact, South Africa doesn't need any more vaccine; they're having trouble getting it out into people's arms, and the reluctance is there.</p>, <p>But no, I don't think it's going to have that effect.</p>, <p>Let me call on Alexis. Alexis.</p>, <p>Q: Alex?</p>, <p>Q: We've got two Alex's. (Laughter.)</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Oh. Alex of Reuters.</p>, <p>Q: Yes. Thank you so much, Mr. President. I wanted to ask if the U.S. is doing anything to screen international travels for this variant, and what is being done, if anything, internally to see if the virus -- this variant has already arrived.</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, there's a lot being done. I'm going to turn to Dr. Fauci to answer the last question about what's been done.</p>, <p>Doc.</p>, <p>DR. FAUCI: Thank you, Mr. President. We already have in place -- when people come into the United States, they have to be tested before they get on and they have to show vaccination documentation. So even before Omicron came in, we have a situation where we'll be able to test.</p>, <p>And in talking about testing, fortunately for us, the PCRs that we mostly use would pick up this very unusual variant that has a real large constellation of mutations -- fortunately for us, that the PCRs that we do do pick it up.</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: And we're following extremely closely -- the medical community, the COVID team -- any developments as it relates to how severe it is, how quickly it mutat- -- how quickly it spreads, how dangerous it is, et cetera. We have more work to do in that area.</p>, <p>And Wall Street Journal, Sabrina.</p>, <p>Q: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. The UK, Europe, and a growing number of countries have confirmed cases of Omicron. Are you considering additional travel restrictions on countries where the variant has been detected?</p>, <p>And just separately, you've urged Americans to wear masks in indoor public spaces, but many states and cities, including Washington, D.C., have lifted mask mandates. So, are you calling on state and local and officials to reinstate mask mandates?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: With regard to the last question, the answer is: I encourage everyone to wear a mask when they're indoors in a crowded circumstance like we are right now and -- unless you're eating or speaking at a microphone.</p>, <p>And secondly, the degree of the spread impacts on whether or not there is a need for any travel restriction. But that's not -- I don't anticipate that at this point. And we'll see. We'll see where that works.</p>, <p>And so the other Alex doesn't have a heart attack, I want to call on him. Is it -- is it --</p>, <p>Q: Yes --</p>, <p>Q: Mr. President, hi.</p>, <p>Q: Two female Alex's.</p>, <p>Q: Two girl Alex's.</p>, <p>Q: Yeah, no, I'm not an Alex, but I'd love to ask one question and then the other Alex.</p>, <p>Q: Can we both ask questions?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay, let me ask the other Alex and then you, sir.</p>, <p>Q: Thank you very much.</p>, <p>Q: Mr. President, is this the new normal that Americans should expect: anticipating future potential variants? Should we expect intermittent travel restrictions and potential drops in the stock market going forward? Do you have any words of reassurance that this won't become the new normal?</p>, <p>And then for both you and Dr. Fauci: Dr. Fauci said earlier on CBS that lockdowns, shutdowns are off the table for restraining COVID going forward. You said that won't be part of your plan, on Thursday. But why is that? Why are you taking that off the table?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, to answer your first question first, the answer is: I expect this not to be the new normal. I expect the new normal to be everyone ends up getting vaccinated and the booster shot so we reduce the number of people who aren't protected to such a low degree that we're not seeing the spread of these viruses.</p>, <p>Now, we -- it remains to be seen exactly what the elements of this particular strain are. But if they're as I hope, then it's not going to be fundamentally different than in the past.</p>, <p>And in terms of -- what was the second part of the question?</p>, <p>Q: Are lockdowns off the table --</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, for now. Yes.</p>, <p>Q: -- in dealing with this? Fau- -- Dr. Fauci, why is that?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, because we're able to -- if people are vaccinated and wear their masks, there's no need for the lockdowns.</p>, <p>Q: Sir, this --</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: My last question.</p>, <p>Q: Yes. Going on from that question, we've got the Christmas period coming up, a huge amount of travel. Would you give it any thought to domestic flights requiring tests or vaccine before people get on planes -- the same as they do for international flights?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, at this point, that's not been recommended. I would wait for my -- the scientific community to give -- give me a recommendation on that.</p>, <p>Q: Are travel restrictions too late to be effective, sir, given that Dr. Fauci says this new variant could already be here?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: You understand the point of the -- of the travel restrict- -- of the restrictions: to give us time to get people to get protection, to be vaccinated and get the booster. That's the reason for it.</p>, <p>Thank you all so very, very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.</p>, <p>And I'm sure I'll see you between now and Christmas, but hope you had a good Thanksgiving. Thanks.</p>]"

Why not an immediate ban? It's going into effect on Monday, but why not do it now, like other countries have done?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, because that was the recommendation coming from my medical team.</p>, <p>Q: What do you say to questions about whether bans create an incentive for countries not to come forward with new variants if you're penalized for doing so?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: I'd say that's ridiculous, because you can't hide the variants. It's not like someone could hide the fact that there's a new variant with people getting sick more quickly.</p>, <p>Q: Do Americans need to be more careful now going into the holiday season? You've been telling people to --</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Look -- I have. Here's the deal: Every American who has not been vaccinated should be responsible and be vaccinated, from age five years and up -- number one.</p>, <p>Number two, everyone eligible for the booster shot should get the booster shot immediately upon being eligible. That is the minimum that everyone should be doing.</p>, <p>And I -- you know, we always talk about whether this is about freedom, but I think it's a patriotic responsibility to do that.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>, <p>Q: Mr. President, have you asked the Fed to singularly focus on inflation, sir, especially with the new appointments?</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: I've talked to the Fed about a whole range of things, from monetary policy to inflation.

1,2,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the Economy and Lowering Prices for the American People,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-economy-and-lowering-prices-for-the-american-people,"[<p>THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. This week, millions of Americans, including some of the people in this room, are likely to be hitting the road, reuniting with their loved ones in cities and towns all across America to celebrate Thanksgiving.</p>, <p>As they do, I want to take a moment to talk about the economy, both the progress we've made and the challenges we remain -- that we have to face.</p>, <p>We've made historic progress over the last 10 months. Unemployment is down to 4.6 percent two years faster than everyone expected. When we started at this job, it was over 14 percent.</p>, <p>Wages are rising, disposable income is up, more people are starting small businesses than ever before, and our economy has created a record 5.6 million jobs since I became President on January 20th.</p>, <p>There's a lot we can be proud of and a lot we can build on for the future, but we still face challenges in our economy.</p>, <p>Disruptions related to the pandemic have caused challenges in our supply chain which have sparked concern about shortages and contributed to higher prices.</p>, <p>Moms and dads are worried, asking, ""Will there be enough food we can afford to buy for the holidays? Will we be able to get Christmas presents to the kids on time? And if so, will they cost me an arm and a leg?""</p>, <p>I told you before that we are going to take action on these problems, and that's exactly what we're doing.</p>, <p>It starts with my Port Action Plan -- a proactive three-month effort to invest in our ports and relieve bottlenecks. Forty percent of the goods, for example, that come into this country on the West Coast come through two ports: Los Angeles and Long Beach.</p>, <p>To help ease the congestion at these ports, I brought together labor and management and asked them to step up and cooperate, to move from operating the ports at 40 hours a week at those ports to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>, <p>And I provided the resources to other key ports -- including Savannah, Georgia, and on the East Coast -- on the East Coast and -- to help reduce congestion and undo the damage caused by COVID.</p>, <p>We also met with the CEOs of Walmart, Target, Home Depot, TJ Maxx, and others. Those retailers -- large retailers and others agreed to move products more quickly, stock their shelves more quickly.</p>, <p>And, by the way, you may have heard the CEO of Walmart yesterday on the steps we've taken. He said, and I quote, ""The combination of private enterprise and government working together has been really successful."" He went on to say, ""All the way through the supply chain, there's… a lot of innovation."" Because of the actions we've taken, things have begun to change. End of quote.</p>, <p>In the past three weeks, the number of containers sitting on docks, blocking movement, are down by 33 percent. Shipping prices are down 25 percent. More goods are moving more quickly and more cheaply out of our ports, onto your doorsteps, and onto store shelves.</p>, <p>And so, all those concerns, a few weeks ago, there would be a -- there'd not be ample food available for Thanksgiving -- so many people talked about that, understandably. But families can rest easy. Grocery stores are well-stocked with turkey and everything else you need for Thanksgiving.</p>, <p>And the major retailers I mentioned are -- have confirmed that their shelves will be well-stocked in stores this holiday season.</p>, <p>And that's good news for those moms and dads who are worried about whether their Christmas gifts will be available. That goes for everything from bicycles to ice skates.</p>, <p>You know, today, though, I want to address another challenge that families are facing and the one that I think they're most focused on right now: high gas prices. This is a problem not just here in the United States, but around the world. The price of gasoline has reached record levels recently in Europe and in Asia.</p>, <p>In France, at the end of last month, it reached about $7 per gallon. In Japan, it's about $5.50 per gallon -- the highest it's been in years.</p>, <p>Of course, it's always painful when gas pices [sic] -- gas prices spike.</p>, <p>Today, the price of gas in America, on average, is $3.40 a gallon; in California, it's much higher. The impact is real.</p>, <p>But the fact is we've faced even worst spikes before just in the last decade. We saw it in 2012 when the price of gasoline hit $3.90. We saw it in 2014 when it hit $3.69. And re- -- as recently as 2019, we saw it surpass $3 in many places.</p>, <p>The fact is we always get through those spikes. But we're going to get through this one as well and, hopefully, faster.</p>, <p>But it doesn't mean we should just stand by idly and wait for prices to drop on their own. Instead, we're taking action.</p>, <p>The big part of the –- of the reason Americans are facing high gas prices is because oil-producing countries and large companies have not ramped up the supply of oil quickly enough to meet the demand. And the smaller supply means higher prices globally -– globally -- for oil.</p>, <p>To address these issues, I got on the phone with leaders from other countries grappling with this challenge to try to find ways to lower oil prices and, ultimately, to -- to the price you pay at the pump.</p>, <p>So today, I'm announcing that -- the largest-ever release from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help provide the supply we need as we recover from this pandemic. In addition, I brought together other nations to contribute to the solution.</p>, <p>India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom have agreed to release additional oil from their reserves. And China may do more as well. This coordinated action will help us deal with the lack of supply, which in turn helps ease prices.</p>, <p>The bottom line: Today, we're launching a major effort to moderate the price of oil -- an effort that will span the globe in its reach and, ultimately, reach your corn- -- your corner gas station, God willing.</p>, <p>I've worked hard these past few weeks in calls and meetings with foreign leaders, policymakers to put together the building blocks for today's global announcement. And while our combina- -- our combined actions will not solve the problem of high gas prices overnight, it will make a difference.</p>, <p>It will take time, but, before long, you should see the price of gas drop where you fill up your tank. And in the longer term, we will reduce our reliance on oil as we shift to clean energy.</p>, <p>But right now, I will do what needs to be done to reduce the price you pay at the pump -- from the middle-class and working families that are spending much too much, and it's a strain. And they're -– you're the reason I was sent here: to look out for you.</p>, <p>There's another issue that's would be –- that I will be addressing as well. Because the fact is: The price of oil was already dropping prior to this announcement, and many suggesting anticipation of the announcement.</p>, <p>The price of gasoline in the wholesale market has fallen by about 10 percent over the last few weeks. But the price of the pump hasn't budged a penny. In other words, gas supply companies are paying less and making a lot more. And they do not seem to be passing that on to the consumers at the pump.</p>, <p>In fact, if the gap between wholesale and retail gas prices was in line with past averages, Americans would be paying at least 25 cents less per gallon right now, as I speak. Instead, companies are pocketing the difference as profit.</p>, <p>That's unacceptable. And that's why I've asked the Federal Trade Commission to consider whether potentially illegal and anti-competitive behavior in the oil and gas industry is causing higher prices for consumers: so we can ensure the American people are paying a fair price for their gasoline.</p>, <p>I also want to briefly address one myth about inflated gas prices: They are not due to environmental measures. My effort to combat climate change is not raising the price of gas or increasing its availability. It -- what it is doing: It's increasing the availability of jobs. Jobs building electric cars, like the one I drove at the GM Detroit -- at the GM factory in Detroit last week.</p>, <p>For the hundreds of thousands of folks who bought one of those electric cars, they're going to save $800 to $1,000 in fuel costs this year.</p>, <p>And we're going to put those savings within reach of more Americans and create jobs installing solar panels, batteries, electric heat pumps -- jobs making those clean power-generating devices.</p>, <p>And by the way, deploying these technologies for each home where they're installed is going to save folks an additional hundreds of dollars in energy costs every year.</p>, <p>Let's do that. Let's beat climate change with more extensive innovation and opportunities.</p>, <p>We can make our economy and consumers less vulnerable to these sorts of price spikes when we do that.</p>, <p>And finally, even as we meet -- even as we meet to work out this challenge, it's important to maintain perspective about where our economy stands today. The fact is, America has a lot to be proud of. We're experiencing the strongest economic recovery in the world.</p>, <p>Even after accounting for inflation, our economy is bigger and our families have more money in their pockets than they did before the pandemic. And America is the only major economy in the world that can say that.</p>, <p>It's a testament to the grit and determination of the American people, as well as our unique approach to this recovery and our focus on rebuilding our economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down.</p>, <p>Because of that approach, we're the only leading economy in the world where household income and the economy as a whole are stronger than they were before the pandemic hit.</p>, <p>Let me close with this: This Thanksgiving, we have so much to be grateful for -- vaccines that are effective, safe, and free; promising new treatments providing for hope that we can bring an end to the worst tragedies of this crisis; record job growth; the strongest recovery in the world; and, most of all, the chance to be together again with the people we love on Thanksgiving.</p>, <p>As you gather together with your family this Thanksgiving, I want you to know how grateful I am to serve as your President.</p>, <p>And I promised you that I'll never stop working to address your family's needs -- and, together, we're going to confront challenges that we face and are going to face them honestly -- and that we'll keep building this economy around the hardworking folks who built this country.</p>, <p>Happy Thanksgiving. And God bless you. And may God protect our troops.</p>, <p>And I'm heading to a food kitchen to serve meals right now. Thank you for your time and effort. And I'll have plenty of time to talk to you later.</p>]"

I continue to follow her.</p>, <p>I just want you to know: When we first were elected Vice President, there was a moment where on -- her favorite day of the year is Valentine's Day, Doc. And on Valentine's Day -- there is the Old Executive Office Building; it's directly across from the White House and the Vice -- the West Wing and the Vice President's Office. And you can look in the windows there, and the press comes down those stairs all the time.</p>, <p>And so, she went and got a ladder. My schoolteacher wife, my professor -- got a ladder. And the windows are 16-feet high with all these panes. And at every pane, she put a -- she got that stuff you use -- the kids use when they're making posters in school, and she put on a heart. And it said, ""Joe loves Jill."" She did it on all five windows -- four windows across.</p>, <p>So, the press called and said -- would I do Valentine's Day with the -- on ABC. And I said, ""Okay.""</p>, <p>And I got on, and we're getting ready to do the event. And what happened was -- they had the lights out, and we were knee to knee with the reporter who was asking the questions. And at the (inaudible), she says -- while we're getting ready, she said, ""Everybody says you and your wife have a great love affair going."" I said, ""I think so.""</p>, <p>And she looked at me. I said -- jokingly, said, ""But everybody knows that I love her more than she loves me.""</p>, <p>And I swear to God, she looked at me and said, ""That's what everybody says.""</p>, <p>So, you know, they also serve who only ""stand and wait."" Folks, I want to thank not only you warriors, I want to thank your families because they ""stand and wait."" And I know how hard it is to have someone who is not at the table on a holiday -- that are in harm's way, that find themselves out of the country. And -- because that's what every time my -- our son was in Iraq for a year and, before that, in Kosovo.</p>, <p>And you do so much, and your families give so much. I really mean it, from the bottom of my heart.</p>, <p>And you're the finest -- you're the finest military that the world has ever seen. That's not hyperbole. You literally are. You're the finest the world has ever seen. And I'm so damn proud to be associated with you.</p>, <p>And it's hard for me to even say it, but I'm -- the thing that's amazing to me is how proud I am to be your Commander-in-Chief. You are the most incredible group of women and men -- warriors -- that we've ever seen.</p>, <p>And so, I just -- we came because we wanted to thank you and tell you how much we care. And we wanted you to hear the engine of Air Force One, so you couldn't hear anything. But -- (laughter) -- that was the main reason we did that.</p>, <p>But all kidding aside -- thank you, thank you, thank you for all that you do. You're the very best. (Applause.) You really are. You are the very, very best. We owe you big. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>, <p>Now where am I supposed to go? I'm supposed to go back and -- see how she points? Look at this: ""Get back here."" You can tell she's a professor, can't you? Well, I'm heading back, Jill. I promise. I'm coming. I'm coming.</p>, <p>Oh, I got to introduce the chaplain.

1,4,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Announcing Nominees for Chair and Vice Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-announcing-nominees-for-chair-and-vice-chair-the-board-governors-the-federal,"[<p>THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Please -- please sit down.</p>, <p>Before I begin, I want to comment on the tragedy that occurred last night during the holiwa- -- the holiday parade in Wisconsin.</p>, <p>While we don't have all the facts and details yet, we know, this morning, that five families in Waukesha are facing fresh grief of a life without a loved one; at least 40 Americans are suffering from injuries, some of them in critical condition; and an entire community is struggling -- struggling to cope with a horrific act of violence.</p>, <p>Last night, the people of Waukesha were gathered to celebrate the start of a season of hope and togetherness and thanksgiving.</p>, <p>This morning, Jill and I and the entire Biden family -- and, I'm sure, all of us -- pray that that same spirit is going to embrace and lift up all the victims of this tragedy, bringing comfort to those recovering from their injuries and wrapping the families of those who died in the support of their community.</p>, <p>We're all grateful for the extraordinary work of the first responders -- from law enforcement to the emergency room doctors -- who are working around the clock to deal with the terrible consequences of what happened last night.</p>, <p>My administration is monitoring the situation very closely.</p>, <p>But now, let me turn to today's announcement.</p>, <p>Twenty months ago, the COVID-19 pandemic exploded in America, creating the worst economic crisis we've faced since the Great Depression, wreaking havoc not only on our economy but the economies across the world.</p>, <p>In just two months, over 20 million Americans lost their jobs and the unemployment rate shot up to 14.8 percent -- the highest ever recorded in America.</p>, <p>And all of you remember those scenes: Major cities and small towns, main streets that looked like ghost towns. Boarded-up businesses. Empty roads, empty highways, empty airports, and empty train stations. Offices were closed, schools were closed, and hospitals were taken to the breaking point.</p>, <p>When you remember the depths of the crisis we faced, it's all the more amazing the progress that we've made since then. We've gone from an economy that was shut down to an economy that is leading the world in economic growth. We've gone from small businesses being shuttered to a record number of new small businesses starting up. And we've gone from devastating job destruction to record new job creation.</p>, <p>Don't get me wrong: We still have a long way to go to fully recover from all the pain and destruction caused by the pandemic. And we're still dealing with the difficult challenges and complications caused by COVID-19 that are driving up costs for American families.</p>, <p>I know, for a lot of Americans, things are still very hard -- very hard. But if we look at the facts -- all the facts -- you can only come to one conclusion: We have made enormous progress in this country.</p>, <p>First and foremost, our economy is creating jobs -- lots of jobs. In fact, we've seen a record new job growth in America this year: 5.6 million jobs just since I was sworn in on January the 20th -- more jobs created at this point in a new presidency than ever before in American history.</p>, <p>We have seen a dramatic drop in the unemployment rate -- from a high of 14.8 percent in April 2020, to 4.6 percent today.</p>, <p>Earlier this year, independent experts were predicting it would take until the end of 2023 to see unemployment that low.</p>, <p>Our economy is creating new businesses -- lots of new businesses. In fact, Americans are starting small businesses at a record rate -- up 30 percent compared to before the pandemic.</p>, <p>Economists will tell you that an increase in new businesses is one of the best signs of an economy -- an economy that is becoming more innovative and more dynamic.</p>, <p>And that's because small businesses aren't just the heart and soul of America, they're not just the bedrock of so many communities across this country -- America's small businesses are the primary job creators, innovators, and drivers that power our economic progress.</p>, <p>That's why it's a powerful statement about -- of the faith about -- that we have in our country -- where our country and our economy is heading that small business creation is surging -- surging in America today.</p>, <p>Which is why I'm proud to say: If you look at my presidency so far, it's a jobs presidency and it's a small business presidency.</p>, <p>So, if you look at the facts, here's what the record shows: record job creation, record economic growth, record new small business creation.</p>, <p>That's a story that should give us confidence about the economy that we're building, confidence in ourselves, confidence in the future.</p>, <p>Now, after years and years of wages being flat or falling behind, we're also seeing something else: Things are getting better for American workers -- higher wages, better benefits, more flexible schedules.</p>, <p>The balance sheets for American families are better as well. Savings are up. Home equity is up. Credit card balances are down.</p>, <p>And if you continue and combine the wage increases we've seen with the direct relief my administration has provided to middle-class families, the typical middle-class family's disposable income has actually gone up 2 percent this year, even after accounting for higher prices.</p>, <p>That's the kind of recovery, just one year after a crippling worldwide economic crisis, that is unprecedented. And it takes us -- no, it makes us stand out from the rest of the world.</p>, <p>America is the only major economy, the only one in the world, where the economy is bigger today and families have more money in their pockets today than before the pandemic hit. That's even after accounting for inflation. None of our competitors internationally can say that. None.</p>, <p>It's a testament to the hard work and perseverance of the American people. It's a testament to the effectiveness of the vaccines and our vaccination effort. And it's a testament to the economic policies we fought so hard to pass and to put in place, especially the American Rescue Plan. And it's a testament to the Federal Reserve.</p>, <p>But for all the progress we've made, we know we still face challenges -- serious challenges. We know there is a lot of fear and uncertainty in the country. We know -- we know it's tough for families to keep up with the rising costs of gasoline, food, housing, and other essentials.</p>, <p>It's not just an American problem; it's a worldwide problem. It doesn't make it any easier for Americans, but it's a worldwide problem. Every country is dealing with the same problems emerging from the pandemic: supply chain bottlenecks, disruption caused by spikes in COVID-19, elevated prices. They're all taking a bite out of our family budgets.</p>, <p>Perhaps no entity pays [plays] a more important role in navigating these challenges than the Federal Reserve because it's the Fed's job to balance two key goals. The first is to achieve maximum employment -- to get as many American work- -- Americans working -- working as possible.</p>, <p>And the second is to keep inflation low and stable. To meet these goals is going to require patience, skill, and independence.</p>, <p>That's why, today, I'm nominating Jerome Powell for a second term as Chair of the Federal Reserve and I'm nom- -- I'm nominating Lael Brainard to take the position as Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve.</p>, <p>When our country was hemorrhaging jobs last year and there was panic in our financial markets, Jay's steady and decisive leadership helped to stabilize markets and put our economy on track to a robust recovery.</p>, <p>Jay is a believer in the benefits of what economists call ""maximum employment."" That's an economy where companies have to compete to attract workers instead of workers competing with each other for jobs, where American workers get steady wage increases after decades of stagnation, and where the benefits of economic growth are broadly shared by everyone in the country, not just concentrated for those at the top.</p>, <p>Jay said it well last month, and I'm going to quote him. He said, and I quote, ""an economy is healthier and stronger when as many people as possible are able to work. If entrenched inequities prevent some Americans from participating fully in our labor markets, not only will they be held back from opportunities, but [the] economy overall will not realize its potential. And those who have historically been left behind stand the best chance of prospering in a strong economy with plentiful job opportunities."" End of quote.</p>, <p>As Chair, Jay undertook a landmark review to reinforce the Federal Reserve's mission towards delivering full employment. We're making strong progress toward that goal now.</p>, <p>And I believe Jay is the right person to see us through and finish that effort while also addressing the threat of inflation that it imposes to our families and to our economy.</p>, <p>Jay and I have had a chance to discuss his views on priorities for the Federal Reserve in the years ahead. He's made clear to me: A top priority will be to accelerate the Fed's effort to address and mitigate the risks -- the risk that climate change poses to our financial system and our economy.</p>, <p>And extreme weather has cost our economy over $600 billion over the last 10 years. We have to make sure our financial system could withstand climate change and is prepared to transition to clean energy. The Fed must be a leader among Central Banks globally in addressing climate-related financial risks.</p>, <p>He's also underscored the importance of the Fed taking a more proactive role in the months and years ahead in making sure that our financial regulations are staying ahead of emerging risks, be they from innovations in cryptocurrency or the practices of less regulated non-bank financial institutions.</p>, <p>Having served as Vice President during the depths of the 2009 financial crisis and having worked with President Obama to put in place stronger financial rules of the road, I understand the stakes of our regulations falling asleep at the switch -- regulators falling asleep at the switch.</p>, <p>Jay, along with the other members of the Fed board that I will nominate, must ensure that we never again expose our economy and American families to those kinds of risks.</p>, <p>I respect Jay's independence, and I also trust that he will follow through on his commitment to prioritize these issues with the skill that he has shown in his service to date.</p>, <p>Now, some will, no doubt, question why I am re-nominating Jay when he was the choice of a Republican predecessor. Why am I not picking a Democrat? Why am I not picking fresh blood or taking the Fed in a different direction?</p>, <p>Put directly, at this moment both of -- of both enormous potential and enormous uncertainty for our economy, we need stability and independence at the Federal Reserve. Jay has proven the independence that I value in the Federal Chair -- in the Fed Chair.</p>, <p>In the last administration, he stood up to unprecedented political interference and, in doing so, successfully maintained the integrity and credibility of this -- his institution. It's just one of the many reasons why Jay has support from across the political spectrum.</p>, <p>In 2018, he was confirmed with 84 votes in the United States Senate. His approach as Fed Chair has earned the respect and support of groups from the AFL-CIO to the Business Roundtable.</p>, <p>Which brings me to one more reason I have chosen to re-nominate Jay: I believe having Fed leadership with a broad, bipartisan support is important, especially now in such a politically divided nation.</p>, <p>I believe we need to do everything we can to take the bitter partisanship of today's politics out of something as important as the independence and credibility of the Federal Reserve. This is vital to maintaining public trust in an independent institution like the Federal Reserve.</p>, <p>And that is why I am so proud as well to be nominate Dr. Lael Brainard, you know, to serve as Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve.</p>, <p>You know, by promoting Lael today to Vice Chair, I am elevating one of the country's most qualified and dedicated public servants. She is one of the nation's leading macro economists. She spent years at the Treasury Department, representing America in capitals around the world on international economic issues.</p>, <p>And she has spent nearly the last decade as a member of the Fed, most recently working side by side with Jay as the Fed navigated historic economic and financial crisis and reaffirmed its commitment to a full employment economy.</p>, <p>Throughout her time at the Fed, Lael has also been a steadfast voice for tough rules that protect the pensions and savings of the American people.</p>, <p>She's led the Fed's efforts to make sure our banking system serves everyone in the communities they serve so that regardless of where you live or your background, every American have acce- -- can have access to credit they need to start a business, buy a home, and just have a fair chance in life.</p>, <p>She's done pioneering work on how the Fed should account for the emerging risk of climate change to our financial system.</p>, <p>And like Jay, her expertise and leadership have earned her the respect and support of Republicans and Democrats alike.</p>, <p>I'm proud to be nominate her to the vital role of Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve.</p>, <p>Beyond Jay and Lael, I look forward in the coming weeks to nominating additional members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, including a new Vice Chair for Supervision.</p>, <p>These individuals will help safeguard our financial system and, alongside Jay and Lael's leadership, help to support and continue this historic economic recovery.</p>, <p>While Jay and Lael bring continuity and stability</p>, <p>to the Fed, my additions will bring new perspectives and new voices.</p>, <p>I also pledge that my additions will bring new diversity to the Fed -- which is much needed and long overdue, in my view.</p>, <p>Last year, the pandemic shut down much of the global economy. Now there is a worldwide rearaking [sic] –- reawakening, and it's creating both an incredible opportunities and tough challenges.</p>, <p>As economies all across the world come back from its -- this pandemic, America is leading the way.</p>, <p>Like every country in the world, we have to deal with these issues of rising costs. But we should remember: We have the</p>, <p>skills and the tools to get it under control.</p>, <p>While other countries are stumbling out of this pandemic, we're racing ahead.</p>, <p>Because so much of the rest of our economy is doing well, because we have created so many new jobs as fast as we have, we're in a position to attack inflation from a position of strength, not weakness.</p>, <p>In times like these, we need steady, tested, principled leadership at the Fed. We need people with sound judgment and proven courage to preserve the independence of the Fed.</p>, <p>And we need people of character and integrity who can be trusted to keep their focus on the right long-term goals of our country -- for our country.</p>, <p>And I'm confident Jay and Lael are those people.</p>, <p>Now I'd like to give both Jay and Lael an opportunity to say a few words. And we're going to start with Jay, and then I'm going to turn it to Lael.</p>, <p>Jay, the floor is yours. You're over on this side.</p>, <p>CHAIR POWELL: Mr. President, thank you for this extraordinary opportunity to continue to serve the American people.</p>, <p>If confirmed by the Senate, I pledge to do everything within my power to meet the responsibilities that Congress has entrusted to the Federal Reserve.</p>, <p>I'm joined today my –- by my wife, Elissa Leonard, and our three adult children, Susie, Lucy, and Sam; and Sam's wife, Elyssa. Their love and support underpin and make possible all that I do.</p>, <p>I'm also grateful to the exceptionally talented and dedicated team at the Federal Reserve, with whom it has been my great privilege -- privilege to serve over the last decade.</p>, <p>My predecessor, Secretary Janet Yellen, left the Fed in a strong position to meet every challenge. And I'm thankful for her leadership, her example, and her friendship.</p>, <p>When COVID hit our shores, American families and businesses were 10 years into historic economic expansion with a robust jobs market that was reaching even those who had traditionally been left out.</p>, <p>The pandemic, however, brought an immediate and painful recession. Fortunately, American resilience, along with strong policy actions and vaccines that enabled the economy's reopening, cushioned the blows and set the stage for a strong recovery.</p>, <p>Today, the economy is expanding at its fastest pace in many years, carrying the promise of a return to maximum employment. Challenges and opportunities remain as always. The unprecedented reopening of the economy, along with the continuing effects of the pandemic, led to supply and demand imbalances, bottlenecks, and a burst of inflation.</p>, <p>We know that high inflation takes a toll on families, especially those less able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. And we use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market, and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.</p>, <p>Other key priorities include vigilantly guarding the resilience and stability of the financial system, addressing evolving risks from climate change and cyberattacks, and facilitating the modernization of the payment system while protecting consumers.</p>, <p>I look forward very much to continuing to work closely with my colleague of the past seven years, Lael Brainard, as the Fed confronts these and other issues. Lael brings formidable talent, a wealth of experience, and good judgment to our work.</p>, <p>Inside the Federal Reserve, we understand that our decisions matter for American families and communities. I strongly share that sense of mission, and I'm committed to making those decisions with objectivity and with integrity based on the best available evidence in the longstanding tradition of monetary policy independence.</p>, <p>Mr. President, thank you again.</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Now I'd like to give the floor to Dr. Brainard.</p>, <p>DR. BRAINARD: Mr. President, thank you. I'm deeply honored that you're entrusting me with this responsibility at a critical time.</p>, <p>I'm committed to putting working Americans at the center of my work at the Federal Reserve. This means getting inflation down at a time when people are focused on their jobs and how far their paychecks will go.</p>, <p>It means supporting a growing economy that includes everyone. It means ensuring that financial markets are thriving and resilient, and the economy is sustainable for future generations. It means serving all Americans in every community across the country and ensuring the Federal Reserve reflects the diversity of the communities we serve.</p>, <p>I was privileged to work with Chair Powell as we made every effort to protect workers, businesses, and families from the COVID financial shock with the support of Congress. And I look forward to working with him in the months and years ahead to build a durable recovery.</p>, <p>I also want to thank Secretary Yellen, with whom I've also been privileged to work. I'm grateful to the many people who've supported my efforts. As a working mom, I'm especially grateful for the love and support of my three dynamic daughters, Caelan, Ciara, and Coco, who took the afternoon off from school; my deeply devoted husband, Kurt; Aunt Vivian [ph]; my sisters; and my amazing mother, Joanne, who's here with me today.</p>, <p>I'm confident that by working together, we will see a strong recovery for all Americans.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p>, <p>Well, folks, that's it. I hope you have a happy Thanksgiving.</p>, <p>And I thank the families of the two nominees for being willing to support their work and what they have to do. It's going to be long hours, as you already know, and long efforts -- and I thank the families.</p>, <p>Thank you all.</p>]"
1,5,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks at the Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation Ceremony,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-thanksgiving-turkey-presentation-ceremony-25,"[<p>Good afternoon, everyone. Please be seated. I'm honored to welcome you, for the first time as President, to a Thanksgiving tradition here at the White House that reminds us to have a little bit of fun and to always be grateful.</p>, <p>You know, as a University of Delaware man, I'm partial to Blue Hens, but today we're going to talk turkey.</p>, <p>To the families of my staff, thank you for joining us, for being part of our team.</p>, <p>And thank you, Pete [Phil]* Seger, chairman of the National Turkey Federation, for continuing the tradition of presenting the turkey to the President that goes back to President Truman.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the turkeys gobbled.</i>]</p>, <p>Yes. [<i>Laughter</i>] Yes. And pardoning the turkey goes back to George H.W. Bush.</p>, <p>I just met your wonderful family: Your wife Krista, who volunteers to get kids vaccinated back home in Jasper—thank you very much for doing that—and your incredible children: 12-year-old Addie and 10-year-old Ellie and 9-year-old Jack. And, Addie and Ellie, I tell you, if you—your parents will understand—the reason I ran for President is so my grandchildren your age could have Secret Service protection—because you're lovely young women, and you're—young man.</p>, <p>Look, and a special thanks to the students at Ellie and Jack's school in Jasper who submitted the names of these two fine turkeys, two names that I couldn't agree on more. Who better to help celebrate the holiday in which we break the bread for two turkeys named Peanut Butter and Jelly? [<i>Laughter</i>] I have to admit to you—my wife doesn't like to admit it—that's what I like for lunch: peanut butter and jelly.</p>, <p>But I also want to thank the farmers who were selected by the National Turkey Federation to raise what's called the ""Presidential Flock."" That's a group of 20 or so turkeys vying to make it here today. In other words, the turkey Presidential primary. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And so I just met—[<i>laughter</i>]—Andrea and Brad Welp, third- and fifth-generation farmers from St. Anthony, Indiana. And they're here with their 5-year-old son, Benton, and their 2-year-old daughter, Brogan, who wonders, ""Why do I have to be here, Mommy?"" [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Since July, they've been preparing the flock for this day. And I'm told the turkeys even listen to music to get used to the crowd noise. And they've interacted with children and visitors to get used to the—their visit to Washington. And eventually, Peanut Butter and Jelly were selected based on their temperament, appearance, and, I suspect, vaccination status. I—[<i>laughter</i>].</p>, <p>[<i>The turkeys gobbled.</i>]</p>, <p>Oh, you see? [<i>Laughter</i>] Yes, instead of getting basted, these two turkeys are getting boosted. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>[<i>The turkeys gobbled.</i>]</p>, <p>[<i>Laughter</i>] Yes. [<i>Laughter</i>] I love them talking to me like this.</p>, <p>This week, they were welcomed on the red carpet at a fancy hotel here in Washington called the Willard hotel, next door. Secretary Buttigieg couldn't be here today, but I'm sorry for Pete and Chasten: Peanut Butter and Jelly are now the new Indiana power couple. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And Andrea and Brad, thank you for pouring your love and pride into this work and this national tradition. And Benton and Brogan, I know you're going to miss your favorite turkeys, but the good news is, you'll still be able to visit them.</p>, <p>After receiving their Presidential pardon, Peanut Butter and Jelly will be headed to Purdue University—West Lafayette—in West Lafayette, Indiana, where they'll be—visit something close to my heart—a train: the Boilermaker Special. That's where they're going to be.</p>, <p>So, folks, turkey is infrastructure. Peanut Butter and Jelly are going to help Build Back the Butterball as we move along. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And so I hereby—I'm going to walk over. I'm going to pardon this year's turkeys—the National Thanksgiving turkey. And the first one—the one who is going to pardoned is Peanut Butter, who should be able to uphold his duties. And also hereby, I'm going to—in case that changes, I'm going to also pardon his alternative, Jelly.</p>, <p>Folks, as I've said before, every American wants the same thing: They want to be able to look the turkey in the eye and tell him everything's going to be okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] And so, folks, it's going to be okay.</p>, <p>In all seriousness, it's important to continue traditions like this to remind us how from darkness there is light and hope and progress. And that's what this year's Thanksgiving, in my view, represents.</p>, <p>So many of us will be gathering with our loved ones for the first time in a long time, and we'll be reconnecting with traditions, with our tables and our hearts full of grace and gratitude for everyone who made it possible: scientists, researchers, doctors, nurses, and other frontline workers who developed and administered the vaccines and kept essential services going; faith leaders and community leaders who counsel, comfort, and heal; farmers, farmworkers, meatpackers who risked their lives during this pandemic to grow, process, and pick the food that's on our tables.</p>, <p>And on Monday, my wife Jill and I will be traveling to Fort Bragg in North Carolina for an early Thanksgiving with the troops and their military families. We'll be able to show the Nation's gratitude for their service and sacrifice and welcome those coming home after 20 years in Afghanistan.</p>, <p>But, folks, as we give thanks for what—we also keep in our hearts those who we have lost—have lost so much, those who will have empty seats at their tables this year because of the virus or another cruel twist of fate or accident. The grief they have is—there is a lot of grief that's deep, that tears at the hearts afresh on every holiday. We pray for them to find the strength in sorrow and purpose in pain.</p>, <p>And as we reclaim our cherished traditions, let's commit ourselves to what the Psalmist wrote—said, ""The Lord is my shield and my strength . . . and with my song I give Him thanks."" Let our song be ones of lives saved, breaches repaired, a nation made whole. And that's the America I know: a great Nation because we are good people.</p>, <p>You, the American people, I forever am grateful for your trust you placed in me.</p>, <p>And from the Biden family to yours, we wish you a happy Thanksgiving.</p>, <p>And may bless—God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.</p>, <p>And may—let's get to the business of the pardon. Thank you.</p>, <p>That's a big turkey. With the power vested in me as President of the United States, I pardon you. I pardon you this Thanksgiving.</p>, <p>Go ahead, say something. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>[<i>The turkey gobbled.</i>]</p>, <p>There you go. [<i>Laughter</i>] ""Thanks for the pardon.""</p>, <p>But I also have to pardon—I have to pardon Jelly too. Jelly, you don't have to get up here, but I pardon you, kid. Yes.</p>, <p>Thank you, everybody. I hope you have a happy, happy, happy Thanksgiving. And it's freezing, isn't it? [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>All right. Thank you all.</p>]"

1,7,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Prior to North American Leaders' Summit With Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-north-american-leaders-summit-with-prime-minister-justin-pj-trudeau-canada,"[<p><i>President Biden.</i> All right, please sit down. Well, it's an honor—I assume this is on. It's an honor to welcome our two closest neighbors to the White House today: President López Obrador and Prime Minister Trudeau.</p>, <p>And I want to thank them for joining me in this first North American Leaders' Summit since 2016. And our North American vision for the future draws on our shared strengths, as well as three vibrant democracies with dynamic populations and economy wishing to work together—that we can be—we can meet today and we can meet all the challenges if we just take the time to speak with one another, by working together.</p>, <p>And we have to end the pandemic and to take decisive actions to curb the climate crisis. We've had a chance to speak a little earlier today, but we have to drive an inclusive economic recovery and make sure all of our people share in the benefits; to have to manage the challenges of unprecedented migration into our hemisphere; and to take on inequity that continues to deny opportunity to too many people.</p>, <p>As leaders, we share an innate understanding that our diversity is an enormous strength, that we are best able to reach our potential when we unleash the full—the full—range of our people's talents.</p>, <p>So today it's about what we can do in partnership and mutual respect to strengthen our region and prove democracies can deliver in the second quarter of the 21st century, including by increasing supply chain resilience and reliance, worker protections, improving cybersecurity, and helping small and medium businesses thrive in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>, <p>A final point I'd like to do is related to today's COVID news in America. First, earlier this month, Pfizer announced that its antiviral pill for people infected by COVID-19—that may dramatically reduce hospitalizations and deaths. They made that announcement. While it's still under FDA approval, I'm announcing today that we have purchased 10 million treatment courses, with deliveries starting late this year and all across 2022.</p>, <p>Second, yesterday we announced nearly 3 million children ages 5 to 11 got their first shot—10 percent of all the children in the first day [days]* of the program. Incredible progress.</p>, <p>Third, boosters—which provide the highest protection yet, especially for seniors. Advisers at the FDA and the CDC are reviewing whether to extend boosters to all adults. If that occurs, we have enough boosters for everyone.</p>, <p>And finally, yesterday we crossed 250 million doses delivered to 10 countries and on our way to meeting our commitment of 1 billion, 200 doses—200—1,200,000,000 doses donated for free, no strings attached, to the rest of the world.</p>, <p>I'll continue to take steps necessary to save lives and end this pandemic.</p>, <p>And I now will invite Prime Minister Trudeau to say a few words. And thanks, Mr. Prime Minister. The floor is yours.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Trudeau.</i> Thank you very much, Mr. President.</p>, <p>I want to begin by saying that we are all thinking of Canadians back home in British Columbia who are facing terrible devastation from floods. The President and I spoke about it earlier today. And I can reassure people in BC that we are doing everything we can to support and have the support of our neighbors in this, of course.</p>, <p>I want to thank you, President Biden, for hosting this NALS—the first since 2016 when I welcomed the then-leaders to Ottawa. It is a real pleasure to be gathered here with friends—with you and President López Obrador.</p>, <p>We are three countries with extremely strong ties between our people, with our visions and values for the future strongly united.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, Prime Minister Trudeau spoke briefly in French; no translation was provided. He continued in English as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>Our highest priority is, of course, ending COVID-19 and being focused on economic recovery, strengthened supply chains. We're making sure that our integrated North American economy produces good jobs and supports the middle class in our three countries.</p>, <p>This will be underpinned by a world-class trade agreement that protects workers' rights.</p>, <p>We're ready to continue working together on the climate crisis.</p>, <p>[<i>Prime Minister Trudeau spoke briefly in French; no translation was provided. He continued in English as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>Thank you very much, Mr. President for welcoming us here.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.</p>, <p>Now I invite President López Obrador to say a few words as well. Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>President López Obrador.</i> Dear friends, without any doubt, signing and ratifying the Mexico, United States, and Canada treaty has been an assertive decision on behalf of our people and nation.</p>, <p>Economic integration, in full respect for our sovereignty, is the best instrument to face the competition stemmed from growth in other regions of the world, especially the productive and commercial expansion of China.</p>, <p>We must not forget that while Canada, United States, and Mexico account for 13 percent of the world market, China demands 14.4 percent. And this imbalance started out only 30 years ago. In 1990, China's share was 1.7 percent and North America's was 16 percent.</p>, <p>If the trend seen in the last decade should prevail for the next 30 years, by 2051, China would account for 42 percent of the world market and United States, Mexico, and Canada would remain with 12 percent, which would not only an unacceptable disproportion in the economic sphere, it would keep the temptation alive to bet on sorting out the disparity with the use of force, which would put us all in danger.</p>, <p>This is why the best, the most convenient thing is to strengthen our economies, to strengthen our trade operations throughout North America and the entire continent—because there are several advantages. Among them, we have the workforce; we have a young and creative workforce, with technological development, and with wealth of natural resources. The distance between our countries allows us to make savings in terms of transportation. And there is sufficient demand within our markets. The per capita consumption of the continent is $18,000 on an annual basis, whereas it is $4,000 in Asia.</p>, <p>Nonetheless, currently, consumers within our region have to wait in line to get home appliances or a car because we do not have semiconductors—chips—or because the maritime transportation prices went up.</p>, <p>Although, the deepest issue is that we are not producing enough and we are forced to importing merchandise from other countries. It is a paradox that so much money circulates throughout North America and the ports of the Pacific are overwhelmed with merchandise from Asia. And we must add the inflation impact entailed.</p>, <p>Why can we not produce in North America what we produce? Well, of course, we can. It is a matter of defining a regional economic strategy. And of course, this happens because we need to jointly plan our development, and we should also foster a productive investment program throughout North America to replace the imports. And we must jointly define specific objectives and leave myths and prejudice aside.</p>, <p>We should no longer reject immigrants, because, in order to grow, you need workforce—the workforce that you do not necessarily have, nor in the U.S., nor in Canada. Why not study the workforce demand, the labor demand and open the migratory flow?</p>, <p>The commercial treaty is a valuable instrument to consolidate our productive processes by embracing the huge potential represented by the internal market that will allow us to grow and develop as no other region of the world on behalf of our populations and nations.</p>, <p>President Biden, no President in the history of the United States has expressed, as you have, such a clear and certain commitment to improve the situation of the migrants. And thus, I wish to express my acknowledgement. And I particularly refer to your proposal to regulate the migratory status of 11 million people who live and work honestly in this great nation.</p>, <p>I hope that you have the support of Congress and the members of both the Democrat and Republican parties. Mexicans will be mindful, and we will, in turn, express ourselves with respect and honesty. And we will know how to correspond with gratefulness, with gratitude, and friendship.</p>, <p>President Biden, Prime Minister Trudeau, I'm sure that we can agree on the fact that we are living in, let's say, interesting times of adversity and challenges. But that's the way it is, and that's how creativity and passion can emerge in order to transform and make history.</p>, <p>Thank you very much and congratulations.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p>Jake Sullivan.</p>, <p><i>U.S. National Security Adviser Jacob J. Sullivan.</i> Thanks. We'll just give the press a couple minutes to leave the room before we get the meeting underway.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, is it time to——</p>]"
1,8,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-president-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador-mexico,"[<p><i>President Biden.</i> Well, welcome. Mr. President, it's a delight to have you here.</p>, <p>The President I were just talking about the long, over—almost 200-year formal relationship with Mexico. And we were talking about—I was explaining why Roosevelt and Lincoln were—their portraits were up here on the wall. And the President pointed out that the reason he liked Roosevelt was, he initiated the ""Good Neighbor"" policy.</p>, <p>And the best way to start this meeting, I pointed out, was: When I became President and as Vice President, I indicated there's no longer a ""Good Neighbor"" policy, it's absolutely equal. We're equal countries. Mr. President, we no longer use language like ""our friends from the south."" You are an equal—we are equal countries—and that's what I like about you. I believe it's a different and emerging relationship that is one born out of mutual respect.</p>, <p>Since January, we've taken significant steps and strides to deepen our relationship, including—including—relaunching the High-Level Economic Dialogue and holding a High-Level Security Dialogue, which resulted in a new joint approach to security and a Bicentennial Framework.</p>, <p>Together, we're taking on problems—mutual problems—that affect our people: getting the pandemic under control, driving an inclusive economic recovery, and addressing migration.</p>, <p>And I know we both are committed to making sure our democracies deliver for our people. Democracies, in the last 20 years, have actually shrunk. There's fewer.</p>, <p>So, Mr. President, I look forward to talking about how progress here at home on the infrastructure initiative that I—we've just passed and building back better—that, hopefully, will be passed very shortly here—and—are made stronger by working with our allies and our partners. It's not just what we're doing here, but working with our allies and our partners makes it even stronger.</p>, <p>As we mark 200 years of diplomatic relations between our countries next year, we'll celebrate both the shared values and family ties that have long united our people and the brighter future that our nations are going to chart together.</p>, <p>So, Mr. President, I want to thank you again for your commitment to the U.S.-Mexican relationship. Going to make it even closer. And I'm looking forward to a great discussion, the first of many.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, President López Obrador made lengthy remarks in Spanish without pausing for consecutive translation. Then, he addressed his interpreter, inviting her to begin the translation.</i>]</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Good luck. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>President López Obrador.</i> We are very thankful and satisfied with the reception that we have had and having this—to have this encounter with President Biden.</p>, <p>Before you were all here, we were talking about the historical relations that President Lincoln and President Juárez had in their time—President Juárez, by the way, was the best President Mexico has ever had—and they understood each other well.</p>, <p>President Lincoln, by the way, never recognized Maximilian, the Emperor imposed through a territorial invasion in Mexico. When Lincoln was assassinated, he expressed his pain in writing. I believe it was a stellar moment in our histories.</p>, <p>The second thing I would like to say is quite significant as well. Franklin Roosevelt, who maintained relations with Mexico based on respect and friendship when Cárdenas was in office—he was the best President of our 20th century.</p>, <p>And, as Pablo Neruda, the poet, said—that he respected FDR's visions and his concept of his ""Four Freedoms"" or liberties: the freedom of the manifestation of ideas, or freedom of expression; the freedom of religion; and two very important ones—the free—the liberty for living free from fear and free from misery. This is why Neruda considered President Roosevelt as the ""titan of freedoms,"" and that is what we wish to come from this new era of Mexico-U.S. relations.</p>, <p>We believe it's easier because, as President Biden also said, he wants us to be equals. From the first time we talked over the phone with the President already in office, he mentioned this—that we would not be seen as the backyard of the United States. And we would—we are thankful for that.</p>, <p>We do not need to reaffirm our principles of independence or sovereignty and are thankful for the respect. And we will keep on helping in the integration of North America as a region.</p>, <p>In the face of the progress made by other regions in the world, our economies and our relations must always be based on respect of our sovereignties. There are many possibilities right now to strengthen our cooperation and economies, and we will keep on acting together as North America. As I mentioned before, the agreement that has just come into force is crucial for our relations. And that is why we are very pleased to be here.</p>, <p>I would also like to say to President Biden—because I made a promise, and promises must be kept—a few days ago, when I visited New York, I promised I would convey our thanks in terms of the bill that you have just sent to Congress to regularize the situation in terms of migration of over 11 million people. We are paying attention to this process and hope that Congress will give you the support that you need on behalf of both parties.</p>, <p>We will follow up on this and hope for the benefits and fruits of this new era, in terms of Mexican migrants that live and work here with honor. We believe that this is a wonderful initiative with a social dimension in favor of justice.</p>, <p>Thank you, President.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Thank you, Mr. President.</p>]"

Trudeau of Canada and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-prime-minister-justin-pj-trudeau-canada-and-exchange-with-3,"[<p><i>President Biden.</i> You guys all have health insurance, right? In case you get injured.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Yes, sir.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Trudeau.</i> Half of them are Canadian, so they definitely have health coverage.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> All right. Well, it's great to welcome back the Prime Minister, who—we've been good friends for a while, and—but it's great to have him here in the White House. We've had a lot of meetings around the country and around the world. We've been with each other—what?—a half a dozen times almost so far?</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Trudeau.</i> It's been a busy year.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> And the—you know, we—I know we're both keeping our minds close to the families affected by the storms, flooding in British Columbia area and the Pacific Northwest.</p>, <p>But one of the things we've spent time on is—on our global agenda is climate change. We've spent a lot of time dealing with that. And we are on the same page as to the need for us to move on it and get the rest of the world to move.</p>, <p>And since our first bilateral meeting back in February, we've met in venues around the world, getting COVID-19 under control, trying to deal with the next pandemic, be prepared for it, as well as meeting infrastructure needs across the developing world.</p>, <p>We see an opportunity not only to enhance the prospects of a better life for people around the world, but we can do it by the Build Back Better World, Build Back Better effort—that we can provide for the health needs as well.</p>, <p>We're contributing a significant amount of vaccines, no strings attached. And we're also—think we can—we should be building back in a more significant, more environmentally friendly way.</p>, <p>We're meeting infrastructure needs, as I said. We're driving inclusive economic recovery—together, as two nations—and meeting the climate crisis and standing up for democratic values.</p>, <p>And so we've spent a lot of time at the G-7, the G-20, and the COP26. And I think we both think we're at our best when opportunity, equity, and justice all coincide. And they're the core values of Canadians and the United States.</p>, <p>So this is one of the easiest relationships that you can have as an American President and one of the best.</p>, <p>And welcome.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Trudeau.</i> Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Joe. It's been a busy year. And it is a pleasure to be back here in Washington with you.</p>, <p>But as you say, we have had the virtual bilat. We've had many, many encounters at all sorts of different international fora where we've been strongly aligned on environment; on fighting COVID and getting through this pandemic, preparing for future challenges; but also on building back better and recovering our economies in ways that work for the middle class, for people working hard to join it in a way that is inclusive and fair.</p>, <p>And we've got a lot of work to continue to do. The easy work is done here at home; the hard work around the world—making sure we're bringing people along. And that's something that we're always great partners on.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French; no translation was provided. He continued in English as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>I'm really looking forward to this. So thank you, Joe.</p>, <p><i>Electric Vehicle Promotion Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, can I ask you a question about your tax incentives for electric vehicles that would be assembled in the United States? The Canadian Government says that would be a violation of the new trade agreement we just signed. Are you going to consider a carveout for Canada, given the fact that our industry—auto industries are so integrated?</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> We're going to talk about that to some extent.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]—car business——</p>, <p><i>The President's Legislative Agenda </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Is it possible, Mr. President, to make changes for Canada?</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> I said we were going to talk about that. We haven't even—it hasn't even passed yet through the House. We're about to see that move. And we don't know what will happen in the Senate, but there's a lot of complicating factors. We're going to talk at length about it, I'm sure.</p>, <p><i>2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Sir, do you support a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics?</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> It's something we're considering.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Something we're considering.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> What about——</p>, <p><i>Electric Vehicle Promotion Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Do you think you can find common ground? On the EV tax credit?</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> The answer is: I don't know. And I don't know what we're going to be dealing with, quite frankly, when it comes out of legislation.

2,0,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on Signing Legislation Extending Critical Support to Law Enforcement and First Responders,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-legislation-extending-critical-support-law-enforcement-and-first,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Hello, everyone. Sorry to keep you waiting for a few minutes. We were doing a little bit of a check-in with—making sure everybody is clear to come in, in terms of health.</p>, <p>Anyway, thank you all for being here. Please, sit down. Please, sit down. I keep forgetting that—I see all my Senate colleagues, and I'm so unaccustomed to them standing up for me that I—[<i>laughter</i>]—no reason why they should either. [<i>Laughter</i>] They should be standing for Pat. Pat, you had a great speech. Thank you.</p>, <p>Okay. Well, Vice President Harris, Attorney General Garland, and Secretary Mayorkas, I want to thank you for your leadership.</p>, <p>And in a moment, I'll be signing into law three bills that extend critical support to our law enforcement and first responders and the communities they serve. And I want to thank everyone who worked together to pass each of these bipartisan bills. I emphasize ""bipartisan"" bills.</p>, <p>Before I turn to the specifics of the bills, I want to say that when you look at what our communities need and what our law enforcement is being asked to do, it's going to require more resources, not fewer resources.</p>, <p>That's why my administration is investing in the community policing we know works and the training and partnership that law enforcement and our communities have requested and in community-based programs and interventions that can stop violence before it starts.</p>, <p>Think about what we ask a police officer. We ask them to be everything from counselors to law enforcement officers to the folks who have to take down the bad guy. I mean, everything in between.</p>, <p>And so just this morning the Department of Justice released a significant new investment in community policing through Community Oriented Policing Services. Everything has an acronym; it's called COPS program.</p>, <p>These grants, which total nearly $140 million, will go to 183 law enforcement agencies and allow them to fund over 1,000 new law enforcement positions and to fund other initiatives to build legitimacy and trust in communities, to address gun violence and other violent crimes, and to combat hate and domestic extremism, and to enhance the response to people in crisis.</p>, <p>You know, in addition, this announcement, along with the historic funding in the American Rescue Plan, means communities have the resources now available for the community violence intervention than—more than they ever had before.</p>, <p>We're talking about programs like violence interrupters, who work as a complement to police in identifying those most likely to be involved in gun violence, stopping it from happening to begin, and put those at risk—who put those people at risk, and put them on a better road to life so we can—we get them—we divert them before they get into the bad stream to begin with. And I want to thank the folks in front of me for doing that. And I want to thank the Attorney General—Attorney General Garland—for leading these efforts as well.</p>, <p>Today's investment, and the bills that I'm about to sign, share a goal of helping law enforcement officers and first responders be the protectors and the partners our communities need.</p>, <p>The first bill I'll sign is the COPS Counseling Act. The law is modeled after successful laws in Nevada, and I want to thank Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you very much for what you did as attorney general in Nevada and what you continue to do.</p>, <p>My good friend Senator Leahy, who's been working on these things for a long time. And Todd Young and Thom Tillis. Representative David Trone and Reschenthaler. Where—there you are. I was looking around. I couldn't see you. I apologize.</p>, <p>And by the way, David worked closely with our special guest here today, Angela Bomba, the widow of Montgomery County police officer Thomas Bomba, whose painful experience helped inspire this bill.</p>, <p>Every day, our Nation's police officers answer the call and confront scenes that can take a toll on them, as well, and leave them traumatized. You know, it's not fundamentally different than folks in the battlefield. An awful lot of people come home without any physical wounds, but come home with posttraumatic stress, and they're responding to terrible incidents.</p>, <p>Well, the same happens for our law enforcement officers, arriving at homicide scenes, handling child abuse cases. As they confront these situations, they need to—we need to help them recover from the invisible wounds that their work can inflict. These wounds are no different from wounds that, as I said, our military encounters on the battlefield.</p>, <p>According to one study, law enforcement officers are 54-percent more likely to die by suicide than the average American because they're under such enormous pressure and they see things none of us ever see.</p>, <p>The vast majority of law enforcement officers tell us that peer support programs are the most helpful mental health resource there is. And that makes sense. If you hold for just a second, it makes you—when you think about it, you know, law enforcement, as well as the military, all have taught to be ""stand your own""; you know: ""Don't ask for anything. You can do it. Just take care of yourself."" And it's an enormous burden we put on people. And it's really difficult. I've learned, working so diligently with the military community, it's so hard to get them to say: ""Hey, I need some help. I need some help.""</p>, <p>I want you to know: A wound that is imposed on your mind is no different than if you broke your arm or got shot in the leg. It's the same thing. It's the same thing. And it deserves to be treated. And it deserves the respect that you—that goes along with that.</p>, <p>Because the strongest support and best guidance often come from someone who has walked in their shoes. However, many officers don't access peer support because they have concerns about privacy and confidentiality, and only about half the States have confidentiality protections.</p>, <p>But this bill—and I want to thank the Congress for this—encourages first responders agencies to adapt peer counseling programs; require the Department of Justice to make the best practices and resources publicly available for people who want to become peer support mentors; and ensure confidentiality to Federal law enforcement officers who use peer counseling services, with the only exception being admission of a criminal conduct and/or a threat of serious physical harm.</p>, <p>My hope is: By giving more effective officers—more officers access to confidentiality and high-quality mental health resources, we're going to reduce the stigma around seeking help and lead to better policing and prevent suicides. Put simply: We'll get more officers the help they need so they can better help the communities they serve.</p>, <p>The next bill I'll be signing is the Protect America's First Responders Act. I want to thank Senator Gillibrand and thank her very much. And, Bill, I want to thank you—Pascrell, and Brian Fitzpatrick, Joe Courtney—they're all dear neighbors where I used to represent—for their leadership in supporting those who have—are disabled or killed in the service of their community.</p>, <p>You know, when our Nation's firefighters, disaster relief workers, EMT, law enforcement officers, and other first responders respond to that radio alert, they run toward the danger while others are running away. They know there's a risk of them getting injured or worse.</p>, <p>And when they go to work each day, their families wait for that phone call. Are they going to get that phone call that something has happened? Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program was originally established to provide death benefits to officers who fall in the line of duty so that if, God forbid, their family gets that call, they don't also lose their house, their car, and they're left bereft, in terms of economic capacity.</p>, <p>It has since been expanded to provide disability and education benefits, and increases the number of first responders who are eligible, including children born after the fact. And so it's really important. And you know—and, Pat, you and I used to discuss this all the time in Judiciary 120 years ago here. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But the truth is, you know, with over a thousand claims a year to review, the program has been slow and inconsistent when it comes to reviewing claims and supporting first responders and families, including those who responded on 9/11.</p>, <p>The law has to change, and you're doing that. You're changing the law to do that. And it's going to make sure this program processes claims more quickly and speeds up payments; makes clear the public safety officers who are acting in an emergency situation, no matter the jurisdiction, are covered; and broadly defines what it means to be ""permanently disabled.""</p>, <p>Before this law, first responders permanently disabled in the line of duty were only eligible for benefits programs if they could never again perform any of the compensated work that they performed. Now what you guys and women have changed is, the—you allowed the disabled first responders who can't do the work they had been trained for, but still can perform tasks and take on work that's therapeutic for them, to do these jobs without losing the benefits, at the same time getting both the pay and the benefit, if it's in a different area.</p>, <p>There's a line inscribed in the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial; you've all seen it many, many times: ""In valor there is hope."" ""In valor there is hope."" Well, as one of the leaders of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Foundation pointed out, this bill restores their sense of valor, and with that comes a lot of hope.</p>, <p>The third and final bill I'll sign is named Jaime Zappa [Zapata]* and Victor—excuse me—Avila—I didn't want to mispronounce it; I hope I pronounced it correctly because it's important—Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who have—were ambushed by a drug cartel hitman in Mexico in 2011.</p>, <p>The assailants tried to pull Agent Zappa [Zapata]* from the driver's seat of the vehicle—and shooting him six times. And Agent Avila, despite also having been shot, was able to push Zappa's [Zapata's]* leg down on the accelerator and escape the attack. Unfortunately, Agent Zappa [Zapata]* later died of his wounds.</p>, <p>That tragedy was compounded by another tragedy: a miscarriage of justice. The murder convictions against the two killers responsible for the murder were overturned on appeal. It was overturned because the law didn't make clear the Department of Justice can prosecute anyone who kills or attempts to kill a Federal law enforcement officer outside the United States.</p>, <p>Thankfully, the murder remains—the murderers remain in prison conviction of—being convicted of other incidents stemming from that same incident. But this bill is going to protect agents serving abroad and send a message to drug cartels, terrorists, and criminals wherever they operate that if you attack our agents, you will not escape our justice.</p>, <p>I want to thank Senator Coons and Senator Cornyn for the—for that legislation. And Representative Henry—excuse me, Henry Cuellar, and Michael McCaul, Steve Chabot, and other leaders for their leadership on this bill.</p>, <p>In just a minute, I'll sign these bills. And they're good and important bipartisan bills.</p>, <p>But I want to thank the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal Order of Police and the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Officers and other law enforcement organizations that have been constructive players in negotiating over meaningful police reform.</p>, <p>So I'm asking the bipartisan leaders here today to come together with them, as you've done before, to finally pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. But that's next.</p>, <p>And now I want to sign each of these bills. I want to—and God bless you all, and may God protect all our law enforcement officers and first responders throughout the Nation.</p>, <p>Thank you. I'm going to sign these bills.</p>, <p>And by the way, there's a tradition where you sign the bill, you give the signing pen to the authors of the bill. But I don't have that many pens with me. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I'm going to make sure everyone will get a pen. Everyone will get a pen. I'm not trying to hoard the pens, guys. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Okay.</p>, <p>Hi. What's your name? Nice to meet you. How old are you?</p>, <p><i>Damascus, MD, resident Jake Bomba</i>. Seven.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Seven years old. Well, you're—you are. What grade are you in?</p>, <p><i>Jake Bomba</i>. First.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> First grade. Well, that's great, man. Thank you for being here. Are you okay?</p>, <p>Maybe after this, I can show you around the White House. Do you want to see it?</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, Jake Bomba nodded</i>.]</p>, <p>Okay. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Okay. Here we go.</p>, <p>[<i>The President signed the Confidentiality Opportunities for Peer Support (COPS) Counseling Act</i>.]</p>, <p>All right.</p>, <p>[<i>The President handed the signing pen to Jake Bomba</i>.]</p>, <p>Okay. ""To amend . . .""—well, I'm not going to read it out.</p>, <p>[<i>The President signed the Protecting America's First Responders Act of 2021 and handed the signing pen to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand</i>.]</p>, <p><i>Sen. Gillibrand.</i> God Bless you, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> All right, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>, <p>All right, now I'm going to sign the third bill.</p>, <p>Okay. ""To amend title 18 of the U.S. Code, to further protect our officers and employees of the United States, and for other purposes.""</p>, <p>[<i>The President signed the Jaime Zapata and Victor Avila Federal Officers and Employees Act and handed the signing pen to Senator Christopher A. Coons</i>.]</p>, <p><i>Canada/Mexico </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, what will your message be to the leaders of Canada and Mexico today?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'll be happy to answer your questions while I—after I meet with them—with all the leaders.</p>, <p>So thank you all so very, very much.</p>]"
2,1,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in Detroit, Michigan",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-detroit-michigan,"[<p>Hello, Detroit. It's great to be back.</p>, <p>Before I begin, I just want to mention three pieces of good news today. First, two of the leading rating agencies on Wall Street confirmed today—not a liberal think tank, two Wall Street outfits—that the economic proposals we put forward for the Nation—the infrastructure law we just signed and the Build Back Better plan are being considered this week in Congress—will not add to inflationary pressures in the economy.</p>, <p>And at one—and here's what one of the agencies said, and I quote, ""The bills do not add to inflation pressures."" Let me repeat that: ""do not add . . . inflation pressures."" The reason? Because the policies I proposed, quote, ""help . . . lift long-term economic growth via stronger productivity . . . labor force growth,"" as well as taking ""the edge off inflation.""</p>, <p>A second point I want to make: We've learned today that job growth in the Nation has been even stronger than previously reported. Every month since I've been President, I stand—the Bureau of Labor Statistic reports the estimated number of jobs created or lost in the country of that month. Then they go back, and they look at more information and check their estimates against what actually happened and give us an updated final number.</p>, <p>What we found out today is, when they looked back at the last 4 months, we actually created 710,000 more jobs in the country than previously reported, on top of the 5.6 million we already had created and had been counted that we knew about. So it's good news that Americans are working, and wages are up as well.</p>, <p>Thirdly, with holidays coming—but by the way, all, sit down, man, if you have you a seat. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm not used to being President and everybody standing. I'm sorry. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But Walmart and Target have made public today what they told me about a week ago: that they're stocked up for the holiday season, their inventories are up, and they'll have all the toys, food, and other items that shoppers are looking for in the holiday season. That's going to happen.</p>, <p>So, now, let me begin. God, it's good to be back in Detroit. And that Hummer is one hell of a vehicle, man. [<i>Laughter</i>] Yo!</p>, <p>As we used to say in the Senate—and some of my Senator colleagues will know, like Debbie—""Excuse the point of personal privilege."" I came up in an automobile family. My dad ran the largest automobile dealership—he didn't own it, just ran it—for 30 years in Delaware. And so I was raised on cars. And I have a 1967 Corvette that I got as a wedding gift when my deceased wife and I got married. My dad could afford the payments. [<i>Laughter</i>] He couldn't afford to buy it.</p>, <p>But the point was, I thought that was the hell's bells, man—[<i>laughter</i>]—327/350, 0 to 60 in 5.3 seconds. This truck—three times heavier, 0 to 60 in 3 seconds. Whoa! [<i>Laughter</i>] And besides, there's a beautiful red Corvette—maroon Corvette I'm driving home over here. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Yolanda, thank you for the introduction. And, President Ray Curry, thank you. No one does more to look out for American autoworkers than Ray Curry. And it's great to be with you today, pal. And happy birthday.</p>, <p>And I want to thank the team here at GM, and especially to your chairwoman, Mary Barra. Mary, you are a—you're an incredible leader. You really are. Thank you for hosting us at the very same facility where you once served as a plant manager. I believe Mary has gotten a promotion or two since then. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>I know a lot about that as a son of a car guy. Thirty years ago—40 years ago, my dad managed those dealerships back home. I used to work with my dad's operation. Drive up to the Manheim automobile auction and bring back automobiles. And I guess I got a promotion too. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Look, I got a chance to drive a pretty incredible machine back then. I thought I—but I never could have imagined vehicles like the ones that I just took for a spin: the first-ever all-electric Hummer, which I first got to check out back in August when GM brought one of the White House—one to the White House lawn—in the South Lawn, along with the electric Ford 150, and the electric Jeep Wagoneer [Wrangler].* Masterpieces of modern manufacturing. Built by union workers. And proof—and proof—that America has what it takes to win the competition of the 21st century.</p>, <p>I want to thank your Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist, who's become a friend.</p>, <p>As well as I want to thank Representative—I—where's Representative Tlaib? I want to thank her for the passport into the city—into your district. Thank you. I appreciate it very much.</p>, <p>And I want to thank my Secretary of Labor, Marty Walsh, for joining me here today as well.</p>, <p>But let me tell you: The infrastructure law I signed on Monday would not be possible without the Michigan congressional delegation. That's not hyperbole. Debbie Stabenow—once again, Debbie delivered for Michigan autoworkers. She was the driving force to make sure this law included a national network of electric vehicle charging stations.</p>, <p>And Gary Peters—Senator Peters was instrumental in securing a mere $65 billion for high-speed internet in this law so families in rural Michigan will finally have broadband infrastructure they need to get connected and expand their possibilities for them and their children.</p>, <p>And Elissa Slotkin—she can't be here today, but she knows that the competitive edge around the world depends on the strength of our industrial base here at home and the people who run that base.</p>, <p>And Dan Kildee continues to be the leading voice for investing in infrastructure in small towns and communities but—so folks in every part of the state can compete. And Dan and Debbie are responsible for the additional tax credit of $4,500 for union-made vehicles.</p>, <p>And Haley Stevens, she ran for office to fix Michigan's roads and bridges. Well, you're delivering, kid. You are delivering.</p>, <p>And Andy Levin, a former union organizer—Andy fought like hell to make sure that this law allowed us to start replacing lead pipes in Michigan and all across America.</p>, <p>And Brenda Lawrence was a key fighter in clean drinking water as well. And we're lucky to have her leading the Democratic Women's Conference and serving in the leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus. Thank you.</p>, <p>And Debbie Dingell, a great friend who—whenever I'm in trouble, I call her for advice first. Now, that—when I don't—when I screw up, it doesn't mean I followed her advice; it means I may not have followed it. But, Debbie, thank you for being such a good friend for so long. Debbie helped drive us across the finish line with this legislation.</p>, <p>Folks, it's not hyperbole to say that this delegation is laser-focused on your needs—the needs of the people of Michigan and the American people—and your concerns. The kind of conversations that take place around your kitchen tables, conversations as profound as they are, are ordinary: ""How am I going to get to work on time if I-75 is flooded again?"" ""How can I be sure that my job at the auto plant is still going to be here a few years down the line?"" ""How can I afford to get my child degree—a degree beyond high school if they don't start with the same opportunity?""</p>, <p>And more broadly, ""How do we emerge from this pandemic not just with a little breathing room, but with a real fighting chance to get ahead?"" They're the things that take place at the kitchen tables I grew up in.</p>, <p>For most of the 21st [20th]* century, we led the world by a significant margin because we invested in our people, we invested in ourselves. But something went wrong along the way: We stopped. We risked losing our edge as a nation, and China and the rest of the world are catching up.</p>, <p>Well, we're about to turn that around in a big, big way. We're going to be building again. We're going to be moving again. And, folks, when you see these projects starting in your hometowns, I want you to feel the way I feel: pride in what we can do when we're together as the United States of America.</p>, <p>And it starts here in Detroit. In the auto industry, Detroit is leading the world in electric vehicles. You know how critical it is? Mary, I can remember talking to you way back in January about the need for America to lead in electric vehicles. And I can remember your dramatic announcement that by 2035, GM would be 100-percent electric.</p>, <p>You changed the whole story, Mary, wherever you are. There you are. You did, Mary. You electrified the entire automobile industry. I'm serious. You led—and it matters—in drastically improving the climate by reducing hundreds of millions of barrels of oil that will not be used when we're all electric.</p>, <p>You know, up until now, China has been leading in this race, but that's about to change. Because this law—because of this law, next year, for the first time in 20 years—in which American infrastructure investment will be far greater [faster]* than China's—the first time in 20 years.</p>, <p>We're going to put IBEW members and other union members to work installing a national network of charging stations along our roads and highways in our communities, over 500,000. And Governor Whitmer has already announced a proposal to expand electric charging stations along key travel routes across the State. And a few weeks ago, GM announced it's going to install 40,000 public charging stations, as we're going to unleash a lot more than that.</p>, <p>Look, we're going to make sure that the jobs of the future end up here in Michigan, not halfway around the world. You know, that means that here in Detroit you're going to set a new pace for electric vehicles. This is not hyperbole, this is a fact.</p>, <p>With this infrastructure law, along with my Build Back Better plan, we're going to kickstart new batteries, materials, and parts production and recycling; boosting the manufacturing of clean vehicles with new loans and new tax credits; creating new purchase incentives for consumers to buy American-made, union-made clean vehicles, like the electric Hummer. Folks—or the Silverado or any other of the 20 or more vehicles that GM is going to come out with in the near term that are electric; and spurring demand by covering Federal Government's enormous fleet of vehicles, as I'm going to do.</p>, <p>I pledged when I ran—we have hundreds—we have thousands and thousands of vehicles in the Federal fleet. They're going to all go electric—all of them—down the road, supporting electric transit systems, electric schoolbuses.</p>, <p>And of course, that's not all the law will achieve. This law is going to start to replace 100 percent of the Nation's lead pipes and service lines. As I stated earlier, every child in Michigan and across America can turn on the faucet and drink clean water.</p>, <p>Ten million homes have those lead pipes going into them and 400,000 schools. Tens of thousands of plumbers and pipefitters are going to get to work in good-paying jobs and help make the Nation healthier.</p>, <p>Folks—and there's an additional $10 billion nationwide to eliminate the dangerous forever chemical, PFAS, which is an incredibly dangerous chemical.</p>, <p>Look, this law is going to make high-speed internet affordable and available everywhere in America, create jobs laying down that broadband line. Today, 14 percent of Michigan households don't have an internet subscription, nearly 400,000 people in this State. A lot of places, there's no broadband infrastructure at all. This law is going to make high-speed internet affordable, available everywhere in Michigan—urban, suburban, rural—going to create jobs laying down broadband lines.</p>, <p>And in the 21st century in America, no parent should have to do what a lot of you did—and they did in my State and all over America—should ever have to sit in a parking lot of a fast-food restaurant again just so their child can use the internet coming from that fast food restaurant. This is the United States of America, for God's sake.</p>, <p>This law makes the most significant investment in roads and bridges in 70 years, fixing so many of those 1,200 bridges, 7,300 miles of roads here in Michigan that are in poor condition—so when a family drives the car you built right here, they'll be a whole lot safer, and they'll get there a hell of a lot faster.</p>, <p>The law includes the most significant investment in passenger rail in the past 50 years and, again, in public transit ever.</p>, <p>I remember Mayor Duggan, who's not here—he's on a honeymoon. He's a good guy—love Duggan. He helped pull this city out of a real tough spot.</p>, <p>And he used to talk about—we—you know, we—I found out—I didn't know it beforehand—that we didn't have—most of the jobs are outside the city, significant—60 percent of the people who had those jobs outside the city didn't have vehicles to get out, didn't have cars to get outside the city. So he provided buses, transit. And guess what? Things began to change. Well, now we're going to change that again.</p>, <p>Here in Michigan, that means replacing nearly one-fifth of the transit vehicles that are past their useful life. That means jobs for folks making the upgrades: good-paying union jobs, jobs you can raise a family on, jobs you can't outsource.</p>, <p>Folks, this law will modernize our airports, freight rail, our ports on—along the Great Lakes, making it easy for companies to get goods to market, reducing supply chain bottlenecks, and lowering costs for families.</p>, <p>This law also builds up our resilience against extreme weather events. Here in Michigan, you know the cost of extreme weather. You remember the flooding this summer that shut down parts of I–75 and I–95 [I–94],* the power outages and tornado warnings. They are costing this State billions of dollars.</p>, <p>Nationally, last year—listen to this: Nationally, last year, the extreme weather cost the United States of America $99 billion—$99 billion—from hurricanes in Louisiana to 20 inches of rain in the Northeast, to the fires in the West that literally consumed more land than the entire State of New Jersey, from Cape May to New York. That's how much has burned to the ground.</p>, <p>This law builds back our bridges, our water systems, our powerlines, our electric grid better and stronger so fewer Americans will be flooded out of their homes or lose power for days and weeks at a time when a storm hits.</p>, <p>This bill also rewards companies for paying a decent wage, for buying American, sourcing their products right here in America, not abroad. This will help the United States export clean energy technologies, including electric vehicles made here in Michigan, to the entire world.</p>, <p>There's so much more in this law. But most of all, this law does something truly historic. This law is going to help rebuild the backbone of this Nation. When I ran for office, I said there were three reasons I'm running: one, to restore the soul of this country and decency; two, to restore the backbone of this country—working class and middle class folks, they were the ones that built America; and three, to unite the country.</p>, <p>To rebuild the economy from the bottom up and the middle out is the way I look at the world. The blue-collar—this is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America, and it leaves no one behind. The same goes for my Build Back Better Plan; it's for our people.</p>, <p>If you're paying, for example, $14,000 or $15,000 a year for childcare so you can work—a lot of families in America are doing that—my Build Back Better plan is going to make a gigantic difference in your life because childcare costs will be limited to 7 percent of your income—7 percent.</p>, <p>Look, my Build Back Better plan is going to provide access to better education. You know, one of the reasons we went ahead of the rest of the world at the turn of the 20th century is, we were the first nation in the world that had universal education for 12 years, not based on any background or income. That pushed us ahead, but the rest of the world has caught up and, in many cases, passed us.</p>, <p>If we were sitting down for the first time today and saying, ""We want universal education in America,"" would anybody say we'd only make it 12 years to compete in the 21st century? I don't think so. So what we're doing is, we're going to make sure that every 3- and 4-year-old in America has access to quality preschool. School, school, school.</p>, <p>And by the way, all of the data shows that will increase by 56 percent the possibility of them going through—all the way through 12 years of school and onto after school—after high school.</p>, <p>And young people graduating from high school will have access to education beyond high school. We're increasing Pell grants, we're providing apprenticeship programs, and we're going to make a huge difference for those 2 million women in America who can't get back into the workforce right now because they can't afford childcare. Look, my Build Back Better plan is going to help solve that.</p>, <p>If you're one of the millions of Americans who is paying around $1,000 a month for your insulin, for example, my Build Back Better plan will make sure that we change that too, because it means that no one will pay more than $35 a month for their insulin. And under my plan, we're going to lower costs for prescription drugs across the board, allowing them to negotiate prices.</p>, <p>Lowering the cost of daycare, eldercare, housing, and health care, prescription drugs—that's what the plan does. My plan meets the moment on climate change as well.</p>, <p>And one more thing: It's fully paid for. Fully, fully paid—it doesn't increase the deficit 1 single cent. As a matter of fact, it will reduce the deficit, according to the experts. And again, no one in America earning less than $400,000 will pay a single penny more in Federal taxes. No one.</p>, <p>And you'll say, ""Well, how're you doing that, Joe?"" Well, I'll tell you what, real simple: I come from the corporate capital of the world. More corporations incorporated in my State of Delaware than all States combined. And guess what? They ain't paying enough. Sorry, Mary. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But here's the deal: Look, I'm a capitalist. If want—if you want to—if you're able to make a million or a billion dollars, have at it. That's good for everybody, except pay your fair share. We have 55 corporations—55 of the largest corporations in America, the most successful—paid not a single penny in Federal taxes the last several years. And guess what? They made $40 billion. I want them make money. That's good, but pay a little. Pay a little.</p>, <p>And that's how we pay for it—for real. It doesn't cost a cent. We all talked—the program has $1.75 billion—guess what? It's paid for. Paid for. And folks, from now on, they're going to have to pay their fair share—not an exorbitant number, just a fair share.</p>, <p>Let me close with this: Throughout our history, we've emerged from previous crises stronger than we were before the crisis. We're one of the few nations in the world who have done that. Every major crisis that has occurred in American history—every one—we've come out stronger after it than before it happened because we invested in ourselves.</p>, <p>During and after the Civil War, we built the transcontinental railroad, uniting us, east and west; creating jobs; and opening up America in a way that had never occurred before. During the cold war, we built the interstate highway system, transforming how Americans lived their lives, allowing us to spread out across the Nation. And now, as we work to put the COVID-19 pandemic behind us, we will build the economy of the 21st century. It matters.</p>, <p>On Monday, I held an important virtual meeting for 3½ hours almost with President Xi Jinping of China. Years ago, when I was Vice President, I was in China with him. We were near the Tibetan Plateau, and we had over 25 hours of private meetings: me and an interpreter, and he and an interpreter. We got to know one another.</p>, <p>Well, guess what? He turned to me one day—this is the God's truth, my word as a Biden—and said, ""Can you define America for me?"" And I said: ""Absolutely. In one word—possibilities."" Possibilities. We're the only nation in the world that believes everything was in our ambit. There's nothing impossible once we set our mind to it. It's never been a good bet, as more world leaders have had to heard me—hear me say, ""It's never been a good bet to bet against America. Never.""</p>, <p>And there's no limit to what the American people can do. No limit to what our Nation can do. Because, folks—[<i>applause</i>]—and this is just not a political speech; I believe this is a fact of history: no limit. Given half a chance—just half a chance—the American people have never, ever, ever let the Nation down. Never. Because of this—this Michigan delegation—this new law gives our people a chance—more than half a chance.</p>, <p>We're at an inflection point in world history. Things are changing, not just here, across the world. And the question is: How do we respond to it? What do we do?</p>, <p>I truly believe—and I give you my word as a Biden—I truly believe that 50 years from now, historians are going to look back at this moment—the last 2 years, and the next 4 or 5 years—and they're going to determine whether or not in that moment: Did America win the competition for the 21st century, or did we lose it? Because that's where we are. All the pieces on the globe are changing.</p>, <p>But we've got to get back in the game, folks. We don't have to hurt any other nation. We've got to get back in the game, though. Because, by the way, if we don't get back in the game and able to do it, who else is going to deal with the crises in the Middle East? Who else is going to deal with the Israeli-Palestinian issue? Who else is going to deal with all those issues that affect—who else is going to be the Nation that decides—that decides—that we have to have a plan to deal with the next pandemic and lead the world so we're not where we are now, because there will be others.</p>, <p>Folks, I'm betting on America. I'm betting on the American people. We've got to focus on what made the Nation great. I have no problem with people on the—Wall Street bankers and others—fine—but they didn't build America. The middle class built America, and unions built the middle class.</p>, <p>May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>]"

2,4,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in Woodstock, New Hampshire",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-woodstock-new-hampshire,"[<p>Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Before I officially start, Billy, you have something you have to give your wife—I've got to remind you. Okay? [<i>Laughter</i>] Okay? You've got it? Okay. You've got it. All right.</p>, <p>Folks, it's a great honor to be here. It really is. Commissioner, thank you for the introduction. And it's great to be with your—with Members of Congress here: Maggie Hassan, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Representative Amy Kuster—Annie Kuster, as well as Chris Pappas. And you know, let me tell you: The infrastructure law signed yesterday—and this is not hyperbole—would not have been possible without this delegation. That's a fact.</p>, <p>No, I'm—Maggie, you did one hell of a job. Because, folks, you should know that Maggie was a clear player in every aspect of this law. She led by getting bipartisan support. She made the case for making sure the law delivers high-speed internet everywhere in New Hampshire, which, as you know from the pandemic, is badly needed.</p>, <p>And you know, we—and that will protect the New Hampshire coastline from rising sea levels and extreme storms. And she was always making sure New Hampshire roads and bridges, like the one we're standing on today, are safe. And this is one is not. And so thank you, Maggie.</p>, <p>You know, and, Jeannie—Jeanne, you know, I won't surprise anyone here, but you were the key member of this bipartisan group of Senators that negotiated the infrastructure deal. Your calm, common sense, as usual, always leads the way. And I mean that sincerely.</p>, <p>The fact is that you need that, being married to Billy—[<i>laughter</i>]—you know, be calm, common sense. And I shouldn't be so familiar, but anyway, I—and Billy is a friend.</p>, <p>But making sure New Hampshire water is safe to drink, upgrading pipes that are a hundred years old and helping eliminate PFAS chemicals from the waterways.</p>, <p>You know, you always made the case that developing the workforce and jobs that we're going to create is an issue that many small businesses here in New Hampshire focus on.</p>, <p>And I might add parenthetically—you know, one of the things that's going to happen: We have another bill that's coming along here that has money for education in it. And it has money for education to provide for money that's directly for community colleges and for apprentice programs and Pell grants to allow people—the colleges to train for what is needed in the workforce—to train for what is needed in the workforce, including major apprentice programs that deal—so you can hire New Hampshire folks to do this work.</p>, <p>And, folks, Annie Kuster is an old friend, and many times—how many times did we talk about New Hampshire's parents during the pandemic who are worried about having—not having high-speed internet at their home, children learning remotely, especially here in rural New Hampshire? And every time this issue came up, you were there—[<i>laughter</i>]—reminding us and making the case she did—as she did in every element of the bill.</p>, <p>And Chris, he was a key member of the committee that—that got this bill across the finish line. Because the truth of the matter is, getting big ideas into an actual bill is hard work, and technical data is required. And it requires getting into the nitty-gritty and details without losing the big picture. And that's exactly what you did, Chris.</p>, <p>He always remembered the big picture and always making the economic case for the investments and how they're going to matter to real people across the country, but particularly here in New Hampshire and how clean water, access to the internet, rebuilding bridges, and everything in this bill matters to individual lives of real people. This is not something abstract.</p>, <p>Folks, it's not hyperbole to say that your delegation is laser-focused on your needs—the people of New Hampshire—the concerns that are discussed around our kitchen tables. This isn't esoteric. This isn't some gigantic bill—it is. But it's about what happens to ordinary people.</p>, <p>Conversations around those kitchen tables that are both profound as they are ordinary: ""How do I cross a bridge in a snow storm?"" What happens—no, I—think about it. You know, you're in a situation—what happens if the bridge collapses and there's a fire on the other side? It's going to takes 10 miles longer to get to the fire. People can die. I mean, this is real. This is real stuff.</p>, <p>What does it mean if a schoolbus or water treatment trucks or logging trucks can't cross? It means jobs. It means time. It means energy.</p>, <p>More broadly, how do we emerge from this pandemic not just with a little breathing room, but a real fighting chance to get ahead? Those are the things that take place at the kitchen tables where I grew up and where all of you—where everybody is living. And Maggie, Jeanne, Annie, Chris, and me, we all ran for office to help answer those questions—the questions at the kitchen table.</p>, <p>I used to get kidded because I spent so much time commuting every day between Wilmington, Delaware, after my wife and daughter were killed, to—back to Washington every single day—260 miles a day. And I'd ride home, and I'd look out the window—this is the God's truth—just outside of Washington. And I'd go through a long stretch of residential neighborhood, and I could see the lights on in the kitchens and in the dining room, and I wondered: What is it they're—what are they talking about? What are they thinking about?</p>, <p>Because that's why I ran. That's why these folks ran. It's about building the—their—taking care of their legitimate needs and to make sure democracy delivers for everybody.</p>, <p>You know, we promised that we couldn't just build back what we had before. We had to build back better. And that's—that's an environmental requirement. If a highway gets washed out, you can't build it back to what it was before, which used to be the measure; you've got to build a couple of feet higher. Because even if we gain control of the climate, we're still—it's not going to go back to what it was before. It's not going to be that way.</p>, <p>And despite the cynics, Democrats and Republicans, we can work together. We can deliver real results. We can deliver real people—results that are going to affect their lives. And that we're—you know, we're taking a monumental step forward in building back better for this Nation.</p>, <p>My message to the people of New Hampshire is simple. It's this: Because of this delegation, New Hampshire and America are moving again. Your life is going to change for the better, and that's literal. For example, the Pemi Bridge here you just—I just walked across—opened in 1939—twenty—excuse me, 82 years ago. This may not seem like a big bridge, but it saves lives and solves problems.</p>, <p>Let me tell you why: Businesses depend on it, like the local propane company or the sand and gravel company or the logging trucks. The public services depend on it. Schoolbuses, waste water trucks cross it every day. It's essential to the Woodstock Fire station about a quarter mile away. Without this bridge, as I said earlier, it's a 10-mile detour just to get to the other side.</p>, <p>And I know, having had a house burn down with my wife in it—she got out safely, God willing—that having a significant portion of it burn, I can tell: 10 minutes makes a hell of a difference. It makes a big difference. Folks, every mile counts, every minute counts in an emergency.</p>, <p>And, folks, this is bridge that has been structurally deficient for years. I'm preaching to the choir here, I know. But the fact is: It used to be able to carry 40-ton trucks. Now the bridge is down to 20-ton restrictions. In a couple of weeks, it's going to be closed to put steel plates down over—excuse me, down and over the weekend and—for sections of this deck.</p>, <p>That steel plate is basically like putting a Band-Aid on a major wound. This is going to make it bumpy for drivers, difficult for snow plows, and it's still dangerous for bikers. And when that's done, the bridge may need even more weight restrictions.</p>, <p>The State has already spent a quarter of a million dollars in ""Band-Aid"" repairs on this bridge alone. And right now there are 215 bridges in your State—215 bridges—deemed structurally unsafe in New Hampshire alone.</p>, <p>Many of them are like the—are less-trafficked bridges; they're often overlooked when decisions are being made about where and how to invest and rebuild. But these bridges are essential in small towns, rural areas—farmers and small businesses—like in my State of Delaware.</p>, <p>Not only about 700—you have about 700 miles of highway in New Hampshire that is listed in poor condition. Driving on these roads that need repair costs New Hampshire drivers an estimated extra $476 every year, per person driving, in gas and repairs and longer commute times. That's $476 in hidden tax on New Hampshire drivers as a result of the deteriorating infrastructure.</p>, <p>But thanks to the infrastructure law, we're going to make the most significant investment to modernize our roads and our bridges in 70 years. The law is going to speed up replacement of bridges by the—at least—by at least a year and allow New Hampshire to invest in other critical infrastructure needs.</p>, <p>Thanks to the Congressional delegation, this law also represents the most significant investment in passenger rail in 50 years and in public transit ever. Here in New Hampshire, that means replacing about one-third of the transit vehicles—buses and the like—that are past their useful life. And what it means: You'll be safer to get where you're going faster, and you'll save money.</p>, <p>And this means jobs—jobs for folks making these upgrades. It's estimated it will create thousands—excuse me, up to two extra—2 million jobs extra a year, and up to 16 million jobs nationwide. Good-paying jobs. Union jobs. Jobs you can raise a family on. Jobs that can't be outsourced.</p>, <p>And that's not all. The bipartisan bill is going to mobilize our ports and our airports and freight rail to make it easier for companies to get goods to market, reduce supply chain bottlenecks we're experiencing now.</p>, <p>I just had to convince the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, where 40 percent of all products come into the western United States, to stay open 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, because they're backing up ships and container vessels for miles and miles and miles, hundreds of them. And that's the reason why you don't have things on the shelves. Why? Because people were dying of COVID in the eastern part of the Pacific—or the western part of the Pacific, making the products that we're, in fact, buying here in the United States of America, or the products that go into the products we buy.</p>, <p>Folks, we're going to lower costs for you and your families.</p>, <p>This Congressional delegation—we're going to start by replacing 100 percent of the lead water pipes and service lines in the United States and address PFAS as the dangerous forever chemical that is a threat to the drinking water here in New Hampshire.</p>, <p>Every American and every child should be able to turn on the faucet and drink clean water, which will also create thousands of good-paying jobs for plumbers and pipefitters putting these—replacing these pipes.</p>, <p>You know, in every meeting about this law, this delegation made it clear that high-speed internet is essential—as essential as clean water and electricity. I don't know how many times you all told me that. But I think I already knew it, but you didn't let me forget it. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And now not just in New Hampshire—for New Hampshire families, but New Hampshire businesses as well. Today, 1 in every 10 New Hampshire households doesn't have internet subscriptions. And in a lot of places, there's no broadband infrastructure at all.</p>, <p>And the law is going to make high-speed internet affordable and available everywhere in New Hampshire: urban, suburban, and rural. It's going to create jobs laying down those broadband lines.</p>, <p>In the 21st century in America, no parent—no parent—should ever should have to sit in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant to connect to the internet so their kids can do their homework or they can get their job assignment. Really, think about it.</p>, <p>This law also builds on our resilience to extreme weather. Southwestern New Hampshire, there have been two hundred-year storms in recent years. Hurricane Irene hit New Hampshire really hard. And you all know that every winter, power will go out from ice storms.</p>, <p>Well, from 2010 to 2020, extreme weather events cost New Hampshire $500 million in damages. Nationwide, extreme weather events cost, this year—this year—$99 billion in damages. I can tell you because I flew over almost all of it. You know, more fires in the West burn to the ground homes, businesses, and forests than the entire State of New Jersey, from Cape May to New York City.</p>, <p>This is the United States of America, for God's sake. And why is it happening? Well, the severe storms that are knocking down all the wires—anyways, there's a lot going on.</p>, <p>We have to—this law builds back our bridges, our water systems, our powerlines, our grids, and—for better and stronger resilience. So fewer Americans are going to be flooded out of their homes or lose power for days and weeks after storms hit.</p>, <p>Look, there's much more to this law. But most of all, this law does something else that's truly historic. Maggie, Jeanne, Annie, Chris, we understand that it is time to rebuild the backbone of this Nation. It's the reason why I ran.</p>, <p>I left politics; I had no intention of running again until I really got upset when I saw those folks coming out of that field down in Virginia, carrying swastikas and torches and—White supremacists.</p>, <p>But you know what else, what really angered me? Take a look at what's happened over the last 20 years. The backbone of this Nation has been hollowed out: hard-working, middle class folks. If I hear one more person tell me how Wall Street built America, I think I'm going to—anyway. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But seriously, the middle class built—built—built this country, and they've been left out. Trickle-down economics does not work. To rebuild the economy from the bottom up and the middle out—and the middle out is what I wanted to do.</p>, <p>Of the listed billionaires in America, do you know how much money they made in the last 4 years? One trillion dollars. I'm a capitalist. You want to be a billionaire and a millionaire? That's great. Good for you. But pay your fair share. Four hundred corporations—550 corporations in the Fortune 500—guess what?—I misspoke. Fifty-five corporations in the Fortune 500 made $40 billion last year. Did not pay one single penny in taxes.</p>, <p>Who pays it? ""Y'all"" pay it, as they say in Southern Delly. ""Y'all"" do. For real. Think about it. This law—and so that's why this bill is paid for.</p>, <p>Look, this long-overdue promise creates better jobs for millions of Americans to let—and I'm going to be clear, especially here in New Hampshire: No one earning—no one earning in America—less than $400,000 will pay a single, solitary extra penny in Federal taxes. I wouldn't even let the bipartisan commission include a gas tax in this bill because that would mean people—working folks would be paying more money.</p>, <p>Look, this law is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America. It leaves nobody behind.</p>, <p>Now our focus moves on to implementing this infrastructure law and with some speed and discipline. I asked the former Mayor of New Orleans and former Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana, Mitch Landrieu—where are you, Mitch? Right there. He—by the way, Mitch loves the cold and snow. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>What—Mitch is going to do what I had responsibility to do with the Recovery Act. I was asked by the President to make sure the $900 billion that was being spent was, in fact, used well. Well, guess what? We spent all that money. We built a whole awful lot of things and with less than one-tenth of 1 percent waste or fraud. That's going to be Mitch's job: making sure that everything gets out and it goes where it's supposed to go.</p>, <p>Look, we're at an inflection point in American history. This law—this law—meets that point. For most of the 20th century, we led the world by a significant margin because we invested in ourselves. But somewhere along the way, we stopped investing in ourselves. We've risked losing our edge as a nation, and China and the rest of the world are catching up and, in some cases, passing us.</p>, <p>Our infrastructure used to be rated the best in the world. Now, this is not a joke: the best in the world. According to the World Economic Forum, we now rank 13th in the world in terms of infrastructure.</p>, <p>Well, we're about to turn things around in a big way. For example, because of this law, next year will be the first year in 20 years that American infrastructure investment will grow faster than China's, for example. And we'll once again have the best roads, bridges, ports, and airports. And we'll be building again and moving again.</p>, <p>Folks, when you see these projects start in your hometowns, I want you to feel what I feel: pride—pride in what we can do together as the United States of America.</p>, <p>And as some—you know, I think the same goes if—I don't want to get into it in detail, because you're going to be freezing, but here—[<i>laughter</i>]—but my plan to build back better for our people, getting folks back to work and reducing costs of things like childcare, eldercare, housing, health care, prescription drugs.</p>, <p>Thirteen—13—excuse me, 14 Nobel laureates in economics said it will actually bring down the costs, it will reduce the deficit, and it will—it's totally paid for—and it's going to reduce inflation, and to meet the moment of climate change as well.</p>, <p>The leadership of this delegation, I'm confident that the House is going to pass this bill. And when it passes, it will go to the Senate. I think we'll get it passed within a week.</p>, <p>And it's fully paid for. It'll reduce the deficit over the long term, as I said. And again, no one making less than 400 grand will pay a single penny more in Federal taxes.</p>, <p>Let me close with this: Throughout our history, we've emerged from crisis by investing in ourselves. During the Civil War, we built the transcontinental railroad, uniting and connecting the East and West Coast—uniting America. During the cold war, we built the Interstate Highway System, transforming how Americans live and where they're able to live. And now, as we work to put the COVID-19 pandemic behind us, we will build an economy of the 21st century. It matters.</p>, <p>Last night I had an important virtual meeting for 3½ hours with the President of China, Xi Jinping. Years ago, when I was Vice President, he asked me—when we were near the Tibetan Plateau, he asked me if I could—I met with him more than any other world leader has. And he asked me if I could define America for him. This a God—true story. I looked at him, I said, ""Yes, I can, in one word: possibilities.""</p>, <p>Think about it: Of all the nations in the world, we're the only one—the only nation I can think of—that has come out of crisis stronger than when we went into it.</p>, <p>In America, we've always believed anything is possible. Anything is possible. We've got to reestablish that spirit. We've got to reestablish that sense of who we are. There's no limit to what our people can do. There's no limit to what our Nation can do.</p>, <p>If you think about this thing—it's never been a good bet to bet against America. Every world leader I meet with and he starts telling me—I said, ""It's never been a good bet. Never."" Give Americans half a chance—ordinary Americans half a chance—they have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down, not once.</p>, <p>Because of Maggie and Jeanne and Annie and Chris, this new law gives our people a real chance. It gives us a real chance; it gives everybody a chance. And that's why I truly believe that 50 years from now, when historians write about this moment, I think they're going to talk about this was the beginning of the time where America recaptured the competition of the 21st century; we reasserted ourselves.</p>, <p>That's exactly what we're going to do, what we can do, what we will do. I promise you.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for your time. Thank you.</p>]"
2,5,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Prior to a Virtual Meeting With President Xi Jinping of China,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-virtual-meeting-with-president-xi-jinping-china,"[<p><i>President Biden.</i> Good to see you, Mr. President. Next time, I hope we get to do it face to face like we used to when we traveled through China. We've spent an awful lot—a lot of time talking to one another, and I hope we can have a candid conversation tonight as well.</p>, <p>Maybe I should start more formally, although you and I have never been that formal with one another.</p>, <p>Good evening to everyone here in the United States, and good morning to you, Mr. President, in Beijing. I'm happy we had found time to meet, and I look forward to a candid and forthright discussion like all the discussions we've had thus far.</p>, <p>As I've said before, it seems to me our responsibility as leaders of China and the United States is to ensure that the competition between our countries does not veer into conflict, whether intended or unintended. Just simple, straightforward competition.</p>, <p>It seems to me we need to establish some commonsense guardrails, to be clear and honest where we disagree, and work together where our interests intersect, especially on vital global issues like climate change.</p>, <p>None of this is a favor to either of our countries—what we do for one another—but it's just responsible world leadership. And you're a major world leader, and so is the United States. How our bilateral relationship evolves, seems to me, will have a profound impact not only on our countries, but quite frankly, the rest of the world.</p>, <p>We have a responsibility to the world, as well as to our people. It's why we believe—and you and I have talked about this—all countries have to play by the same rules of the road, why the United States is always going to stand up for our interests and values and those of our allies and partners.</p>, <p>If past is prologue, I am sure that today we'll be discussing those areas where we have concerns: from human rights, to economics, to ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific.</p>, <p>And I think it's very important, as I've told other world leaders when they ask about our relationship, is that we have always communicated with one another very honestly and candidly. And it's—we never walk away wondering what the other man is thinking.</p>, <p>And to—I think that's an important ingredient for this relationship: to be open and candid, in terms of our relationship. And I think it's important we communicate honestly and directly to one another about our priorities and our intentions.</p>, <p>I look forward to getting down to business and—on the extensive and substantive of agenda we have ahead of us. And I thank you very much. And thank you for your congratulatory call when I won the election. It was very gracious of you.</p>, <p>Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>, <p><i>President Xi.</i> Good to see you, Mr. President, and your colleagues.</p>, <p>It's the first time for us to meet virtually. Although it's not as good as a face-to-face meeting, I'm very happy to see my old friend.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p><i>President Xi.</i> Right now both China and the United States are at critical stages of development, and humanity lives in a global village, and we face multiple challenges together. As the world's two largest economies and the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China and the United States need to increase communication and cooperation.</p>, <p>We should each run our domestic affairs well and, at the same time, shoulder our share of international responsibilities and work together to advance the noble cause of world peace and development. This is the shared desire of the people of our two countries and around the world, and the joint mission of Chinese and American leaders.</p>, <p>A sound and steady China-U.S. relationship is required for advancing our two countries' respective development and for safeguarding a peaceful and stable international environment, including finding effective responses to global challenges such as climate change, which you referenced, and the COVID pandemic.</p>, <p>China and the United States should respect each other, coexist in peace, and pursue win-win cooperation. I stand ready to work with you, Mr. President, to build consensus, take active steps, and move China-U.S. relations forward in a positive direction. Doing so would advance the interests of our two peoples and meet the expectation of the international community.</p>, <p>I now look forward to a wide-ranging and a comprehensive discussion with you, Mr. President, on overarching issues.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Thank you.</p>]"

Joe!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well—[<i>laughter</i>]. Well, thank you. Heather, you thought—you're surprised you're standing here. [<i>Laughter</i>] Jill was very surprised I'm standing here. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Well, Heather, thank you for the introduction. And I can't look over here because the Sun is shining in my eyes, but all this other crowd over here—and thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for all you've done.</p>, <p>Look, thanks for sharing this day with us—why this day matters to you and our fellow—your fellow Iron Workers and your families. And you explained it well.</p>, <p>And for all the folks at home, I know this day matters to you as well. I know you're tired of the bickering in Washington, frustrated by the negativity, and you just want us to use and focus on your needs, your concerns, and the conversations that are taking place at your kitchen table—conversations as profound as they are ordinary.</p>, <p>How do I find work? And how do I get there? How can our small business thrive and our child succeed in school? Or how do we emerge from this pandemic not just with a little bit of breathing room, but with a real fighting chance to get ahead?</p>, <p>When we ran for President, to help—I thought maybe I could help answer some of those questions for you and the needs you have. Because every time I'd ride home on Amtrak, I'd go through just north of—just south of Baltimore. I'd look out as it would go through a suburban neighborhood. I'd look in those—all those lights were on in the windows, Nance, and I'd look, and I'd wonder, ""What are they talking about?"" I'm serious. I swear to God. ""What are they talking about sitting at that table? What are they talking about?""</p>, <p>They're talking about the things that I talked about at our kitchen table, Jill at hers, and all of you as well. Ask about, ""How can we come together to be President for all Americans, to make sure our democracy delivers for you, for all of you?""</p>, <p>And I promised that we couldn't just build back to what it was before. We literally had to build back better. You couldn't build back—we're the only country that's always come out of great crises stronger than when we went in.</p>, <p>And the world has changed, and we have to be ready. My fellow Americans, today, I want you to know: We hear you, and we see you. The bill I'm about to sign into law is proof that despite the cynics, Democrats and Republicans can come together and deliver results.</p>, <p>We can do this. We can deliver real results for real people. We see in ways that really matter each and every day, to each person out there. And we're taking a monumental step forward to build back better as a nation.</p>, <p>I want to thank everyone who helped make this happen: Vice President Harris, my Cabinet members, my White House team, Jill, Doug, our First Lady, and our—First Lady and our Second Husband. No, I'm joking. [<i>Laughter</i>] These guys travel all over the country together. I'm getting worried, you know. [<i>Laughter</i>] And Doug is one hell of a lawyer besides.</p>, <p>And everybody from the United States Senate—Majority Leader Schumer and a group of Senate Democrats and Republicans have established this bipartisan framework, including representatives and all the folks you heard from.</p>, <p>Senator Rob Portman is a really—hell of a good guy. I'm not hurting you, Rob, because I know you're not running again. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's the only reason I say it. But you are a hell of a good guy. And the most determined woman I know: Senator Kyrsten Sinema. Congratulations, Kyrsten.</p>, <p>Look, Committee Chair Tom Carper, Ranking Member Shelley Moore Capito. I also want to thank Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for voting for this bill and talking about how useful and important it is.</p>, <p>And from the House of Representatives: Speaker Pelosi; Steny Hoyer; Jim Clyburn; and Committee Chair Pete DeFazio. Democrats and Republicans. Progressives and moderates.</p>, <p>I'd like to pause and ask all the committee chairs and ranking members of the United States Senate and House that are here today—please stand. Would all of you stand? Come on. [<i>Applause</i>] All right. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>, <p>To state the obvious, none of this would have happened without all of you. I really mean it.</p>, <p>And also, to the Governors—where are the Governors? Governors, stand up. Come on. I want you to stand up. Red States, blue States—you all contacted me. You all said you were for this. You all stepped up.</p>, <p>And more than 375 mayors—Democrats and Republicans—from every State and District of Columbia wrote me asking to get this done.</p>, <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> You've got it, kid.</p>, <p><i>Audience member.</i> You've got it.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] And nearly 50 of whom are here today, including Republican mayor of Fontana who—from California—from Fontana—from California—Fontana, California, Mayor Warren, who spoke earlier.</p>, <p>And the county and State and Tribal leaders as well—civil rights leaders, faith leaders. Law—you know, this law was supported by business groups—the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; the National Association of Manufacturers; the Business Roundtable, representing 200 of the largest corporations in America and other top business.</p>, <p>I want to especially thank—and I'm sure you all—as we used to say in the Senate—I'd say, ""a point of personal privilege""—I want to thank organized labor—who understand this about jobs. You all stood up. Jobs! Jobs! Jobs! Jobs!</p>, <p>Special thanks to the AFL-CIO; the United Auto Workers; electric workers, the IBEW; the iron workers—it goes on—plumbers, pipe fitters, and the building trades, steel workers—who did I leave out? [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Pardon me?</p>, <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And my wife is a member of a union, the NEA. I'm going to get in trouble.</p>, <p>Machinists—so many more.</p>, <p>Look folks, for too long, we've talked about having the best economy in the world. We've talked about asserting American leadership around the world, with the best and the safest roads, railroads, ports, airports.</p>, <p>Here in Washington, we've heard countless speeches and promises and white papers from experts. But today we're finally getting this done.</p>, <p>So my message to the American people is this: America is moving again, and your life is going to change for the better.</p>, <p>If you live in one of the top—if you live in one of the 10 million homes or your child attends one of the 400,000 schools or childcare centers that still has lead pipes in them, you face a clear and present danger to your child's health and your health now.</p>, <p>This law is going to start to replace 100 percent of the Nation's lead pipes and service lines so every American, every child can turn on the faucet and drink clean water. And tens of thousands of plumbers and pipefitters are going to get work done in good-paying jobs.</p>, <p>Folks, as we saw with remote learning, remote working during the pandemic, access to high-speed internet is essential—and access to water—as essential as access to water and electricity. This law is going to make high-speed internet affordable and available everywhere—everywhere in America—urban suburban, rural—and create jobs laying down those broadband lines.</p>, <p>No parent—no parent——</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President coughed.</i>]</p>, <p>Excuse me. No parent should have to sit in a parking lot at a fast-food restaurant again just so their child can use the internet to do their homework. That's over.</p>, <p>And, folks, if I visited your town, I'm sure you'd be able to tell me and—where you hold your breath as you cross the particular bridge or where the most dangerous intersection in your town is. This law makes this the most significant investment in roads and bridges in the past 70 years. It makes the most significant investment in passenger rail in the past 50 years and in public transit ever.</p>, <p>So what that means is, you're going to be safer, and you're going to get there faster, and we're going to have a whole hell of a lot pollution—less pollution in the air.</p>, <p>The bipartisan law will modernize our ports, our airports, our freight rail to make it easier for companies to get goods to market; reduce supply chain bottlenecks, as we're experiencing now; and lower costs for you and your family.</p>, <p>The law also builds on our resilience so that the next storm—superstorm, drought, wildfire, hurricane—can be dealt with. Last year alone, the United States, as a consequence of these kind of extreme weather events, lost $99 billion in the United States alone in damage.</p>, <p>After Hurricane Ida—I see the distinguished Governor from Louisiana is over there; I saw him stand up—I went down to see him. We went through and saw all the damage there. They had 179-mile-an-hour winds at top speed in Louisiana.</p>, <p>But then I headed on up to New York—Chuck, up in your area—into Queens and New Jersey. More people died there than in a hurricane. More people died with the flooding.</p>, <p>Record wildfires raged and went—I went to Idaho and California and saw it. More land has burned to the ground than the entire State of New Jersey out west.</p>, <p>Folks—walk the neighborhoods and look the people in the eye in these circumstances, as many of you have, and you'll see the despair and the heartache. So many of you understand; you're living through it.</p>, <p>This law builds back our bridges, our water systems, our powerlines, our levees better and stronger so few Americans will be flooded out of their homes or lose power in those days and weeks that comes with the storms that hit.</p>, <p>Folks, this bipartisan law, for the first time ever, creates a true national network of charging stations for electric vehicles—over 500,000 of them—so you can charge your car here and drive all the way to California not worrying about having to find places to charge, creating thousands of jobs—thousands.</p>, <p>It is also going to make it possible for Americans to get off the sidelines and into the game of manufacturing solar panels, wind turbines, batteries to store energy and power for electric vehicles, including electric schoolbuses, which will mean millions of children will no longer inhale the dangerous diesel fumes that come out of the buses. [<i>Applause</i>] For real. It's a big deal.</p>, <p>And it will reward companies for paying good wages and for buying American, sourcing their products here in America right now. It's going to help the United States export clean energy technologies to the world, creating millions—tens of thousands of more jobs.</p>, <p>There's so much more in the law, but most of all, it does something truly historic. I ran for President believing it was time to rebuild the backbone of this Nation, which I characterized as working people in the middle class—they're the ones who built the country—and to rebuild the economy from the bottom up in the middle out.</p>, <p>This law delivers on that long-overdue promise, in my view. It creates better jobs for millions of Americans. And no one—no one—earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a single penny in Federal taxes because of it. And it does not include—as we did the bipartisan infrastructure bill, it does not include a single penny in gas tax, which I rejected because people under $400,000 would be paying it.</p>, <p>This law is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America. It leaves no one behind. And it makes—it marks an inflection point that we face as a nation.</p>, <p>For most of the 20th century, we led the world by a significant margin because we invested in ourselves. But somewhere along the way, we stopped investing in ourselves. We've risked losing our edge as a nation, and China and the rest of the world are catching up. Our infrastructure used to be rated the best in the world. Now, according to the World Economic Forum, we rank 13th in the world. Well, that's about to change.</p>, <p>Things are going to turn around in a big way. For example, because of this law, next year will be the first year in 20 years American infrastructure investment will grow faster than China's. We'll once again have the best roads, bridges, ports, and airports over the next decade. And we'll lead the world into the 21st century with modern cars and trucks and transit systems. We're going to do this by building again and moving again.</p>, <p>Folks, too often in Washington the reason we didn't get things done is because we insisted on getting everything we want—everything. With this law, we focus on getting things done. I ran for President because the only way to move this country forward, in my view, was through compromise and consensus. That's how the system works. That's American democracy.</p>, <p>And I'm going to be signing a law that is truly consequential, because we made our democracy deliver for the American people. We compromised. We reached a consensus. That's necessary.</p>, <p>And now our focus moves to implementing an infrastructure law that's going to—with speed and with discipline. I have a lot of experience in doing that. When I was Vice President, I was given responsibility for overseeing and implementing the Recovery Act, a nearly $900 billion emergency package.</p>, <p>I'm proud to say that when we finished implementing that Recovery Act, it was determined that there had been less than two-tenths of 1 percent waste, fraud, or abuse. And I was—it was how I learned and earned the nickname ""Sheriff Joe"" from President Obama. Because I made it a point, every single day for well over a year, to stay on top of how the money was being used.</p>, <p>I spoke with over 160 mayors, two, three times sometimes. And I spoke with county executives and every Governor save one—I won't mention that; save one—[<i>laughter</i>]—she could see Alaska from her porch, but—monitor what we're doing, just how it was being done.</p>, <p>And it was one of the most efficient implementations of a major program in American history. And now we owe it to the American people to do the same thing again.</p>, <p>And to make sure every penny is spent where it's supposed to go in a timely fashion, I've asked the former mayor of New Orleans and former Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana, Mitch Landrieu, to oversee this responsibility.</p>, <p>He'll have full access to every tool the Federal Government has to get it done. And we have the high obligation and responsibility to make sure this money is used wisely and used well.</p>, <p>Folks, I've been looking forward to this day for a long time like all of my colleagues here have.</p>, <p>Tomorrow I'll be traveling to New Hampshire to visit a bridge that is structurally not safe, like thousands of bridges across America. That's what this law is all about: keeping communities safer and more efficient.</p>, <p>On Wednesday, I'll be in Detroit to meet with the UAW workers who are building the next generation of electric vehicles. And that's just the beginning.</p>, <p>We're also seeing me and the Vice—you'll be seeing me and the Vice President Harris, Jill and Doug, Cabinet officials hitting the road to help you understand how this is going to transform your lives for the better. And, folks, when you see those projects start in your hometowns, I want you to feel what I feel: pride, pride in what we can do together as the United States of America.</p>, <p>Folks, you know, the same goes for my plan to build back better for the people—getting folks back to work and reducing costs of things like childcare, eldercare, housing, health care, prescription drugs, and meeting the moment on climate change.</p>, <p>I'm confident that the House will pass this bill, and then we're going to have to pass it in the Senate. And it's fully paid for. It will reduce the deficit over the long term, according to leading economists in the world. And again, no one earning less than $400,000 will pay a single penny more in Federal taxes. And together—together—with the infrastructure bill, millions of lives will be changed for the better.</p>, <p>Folks, let me close with this: Throughout our history, we've emerged from crises by investing in ourselves. During and after the Civil War, it's been referenced, we built the transcontinental railroad, uniting East and West and uniting America. During the cold war, we built the Interstate Highway System, transforming how America lived their lives. And now we're emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, and we'll build an economy for the 21st century.</p>, <p>When I met with the President of China—who I'm going to be speaking with tonight—several years ago, he asked me—we were in China—he asked me—he said: Could I define America? And I said, ""Absolutely."" It's the God's truth. I said: ""Absolutely. I can define it in one word—possibilities. Possibilities.""</p>, <p>There is no limit to what our people think we can do. And there is no limit to what our Nation can do. And there is no one thing that I know more than this: It's never, ever been a good bet to bet against the American people. Never, never, never.</p>, <p>Given half a chance, the American people have never, ever, ever, ever let this nation down. And it's our job to give our people that chance. It's our job to come together and make sure we remain a nation of possibilities.</p>, <p>As I look out on this crowd today, I see Democrats and Republicans, national leaders, local leaders, all elected officials, labor leaders, business leaders, and most of all, I see fellow Americans. I see America.</p>, <p>Let's remember this day. Let's remember we can come together. And most of all, let's remember what we got done for the American people when we do come together.</p>, <p>I truly believe that 50 years from now, historians are going to look back at this moment and say, ""That's the moment America began to win the competition of the 21st century.""</p>, <p>So, with confidence, optimism, with vision and faith in each other, let's believe in possibilities. Let's believe in one another. And let's believe in America.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.</p>, <p>Now let me sign this bipartisan bill.</p>, <p>[<i>The President signed the bill.</i>]</p>, <p>Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thanks, everybody.</p>]"
2,7,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks at a Virtual White House Tribal Nations Summit and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-virtual-white-house-tribal-nations-summit-and-exchange-with-reporters,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Thank you, Madam Secretary. You're doing a good job. And I say to the press, ""Excuse my back.""</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President turned to face the video screen behind the podium and addressed participants as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>Next time in Washington, okay? I see you all up on the board behind me, and I hope we do this in person. I hope, I hope, I hope. That's my hope. Thank you.</p>, <p>[<i>The President returned to face the podium</i>.]</p>, <p>Good morning. I want to thank you for joining us. This is a big day. I think, as my mother would say, former Senator Dan Inouye is looking down going: ""Finally. Finally."" I was raised by Dan Inouye in the United States Senate.</p>, <p>And to President Fawn Sharp, and Chairman Hill of the Oneida Nation, and our President Holsey: I thank you all for what you're doing, and I want to recognize you.</p>, <p>And, Chairman Hill, I thought going—being from Upstate New York, in college, and my deceased wife is from Skaneateles Lake, not far from Oneida, New York—I thought that the Oneida Nation was all in Central New York, but obviously, you're up in Wisconsin. Come down and see us in Oneida. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Anyway, I want to thank you, Madam Secretary, for your remarks. But I also want to thank you, Deb, for being willing to join when I asked you to come along and to serve. And as I said, I was confident, at the time, you would be incredibly important.</p>, <p>When I got to the Senate, Dan Inouye took me under his wing. He helped me understand the simple truth that I had only been vaguely aware of, and that is that Tribal nations do better when they make their own decisions. That's why some of the votes I took as a young Senator are among my proudest: supporting the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, the Indian Child Welfare Act, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, and so much more.</p>, <p>When I ran for President, it was important for me to continue to make progress. And that's what we've done since I took office. When COVID-19 struck in Indian—it hit Indian Country with devastating consequences. Native Americans contracted the virus at over three times the rate of white Americans, nearly twice the rate of lives lost; twice as many died as a percentage.</p>, <p>But Tribal nations stepped up. And today, the Native Americans have gone from being a population most harmed by COVID to one of the populations most vaccinated against COVID. That success has a lot to do with Tribal leadership, but it also has to do with the American Rescue Plan, which included over $31 billion—$31 billion—for Tribal nations, the most significant investment in the history of Indian Country. Long overdue.</p>, <p>Now we're taking the next step. Today I'm signing—and I'll shortly sign—a bipartisan infrastructure deal. Everyone knows we're long overdue to make major investments in infrastructure, but nobody knows that better than Indian Country. Tribal lands have been chronically underfunded for generations.</p>, <p>And so I'm very proud to say that when I sign the bill outside on the South Lawn shortly, the single largest investment in Tribal infrastructure ever is going to occur: more than $13 billion in direct investments to Indian Country and tens of billions more in grants and future funding opportunities: funding for clean drinking water, high-speed internet, roads and bridges, environmental cleanups, and so much more.</p>, <p>But we can't stop there. We need Congress to pass my Build Back Better plan as well. Today, 1 in 10 Native American parents have reported having to quit or change their jobs or turn down an opportunity due to a childcare challenge. This bill would save most families thousands of dollars per year in childcare, helping moms and dads rejoin the workforce.</p>, <p>But also, this bill, when it passes, will allow every 3- and 4-year-old in the Nation to attend high-quality preschool, increasing considerably their chances of getting all the way through the first 12 years of primary school and on to college. It includes the most significant investment to tackle the climate crisis in history.</p>, <p>And I might note parenthetically: No group of Americans has created and cared more about preserving what we inherited than the Tribal nations. And it will be expanded—will—this also will expand health coverage, lower costs for millions of Americans.</p>, <p>You know, we have to continue to stand up for the dignity and sovereignty of Tribal nations. My dad used the word ""dignity"" I think more than any other word. He said, ""Everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity.""</p>, <p>I was proud to reestablish the White House Council on Native American Affairs and to issue a memorandum my first week in office instructing my entire administration to engage in a regular, meaningful consultation with Tribal nations. I was kidding my wife Jill, who'll be out here shortly: She's visited the Navajo Nation so many times I'm worried she's not going to come home.</p>, <p>But look, I've been proud—I'm proud to—of the—to name Native American leaders in my administration: not only the first Native American Cabinet Secretary—and it won't be the last in history—but more than 50 Native Americans now serving in significant roles in my administration.</p>, <p>We've also taken action to protect Tribal lands: revoking the permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline; preserving and protecting their sacred homeland, including Bears Ears and the Grand Staircase-Escalante. It's part of who we are as a nation. And I'm grateful to the Tribes who led the effort.</p>, <p>You know, we also can be proud of that progress, but there's still so much more to do. So today I'm announcing five new initiatives. First, a new initiative involving 17 departments and agencies to protect Tribal treaty rights and the work of the Federal Government. Second, a new initiative to increase Tribal participation in the management and stewardship of Federal lands.</p>, <p>Third, my administration will be the first to work with the Tribes to comprehensively incorporate Tribal ecological knowledge into the Federal Government's scientific approach, helping us fight climate change.</p>, <p>And fourth, taking action to protect the Greater Chaco Landscape in Northwest New Mexico from future oil and gas drilling and leasing. And fifth, I'm about to sign an Executive order, in a moment, addressing the crisis of violence against Native Americans.</p>, <p>Today I'm directing Federal officials to work with Tribal nations on a strategy to improve public safety and advance justice. This builds on the work we did together in reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act in 2013, when we granted authority to try to exercise jurisdiction over non-Indian offenders who commit violence on Tribal lands. We're going to reauthorize that again. We're going to expand the jurisdiction to include other offenses like sex trafficking, sexual assault, and child abuse.</p>, <p>These efforts—again, to use the word my dad would use much—are a matter of dignity. That's the foundation of our nation-to-nation partnership. That's what this summit is all about. So I want to thank everyone who's here for participating, and I look forward to continuing to work together.</p>, <p>And now it's my honor to sign an Executive order. And a couple of my friends are going to be coming out here, I'm told, Cabinet members. But you know, here we go.</p>, <p>Where is everybody? [<i>Laughter</i>] Jill.</p>, <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Hi. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Jill is here. The Attorney General. We've got—oh, everybody is there. All right, Jill.</p>, <p>I don't know what was going on back there, but I—[<i>laughter</i>]. You're all here. Okay. I was worried you weren't going to come out here. [<i>Laughter</i>] Good to see you. All right.</p>, <p>The title of this legislation is ""Improving Public Safety and Criminal Justice for Native Americans and Addressing the Crisis of Missing or Murdered Indigenous People.""</p>, <p>And I'm proud to sign it. It's long overdue.</p>, <p>[<i>The President signed the Executive order and distributed pens.</i>]</p>, <p>Thank you all so very much.</p>, <p>We're going to make some substantial change in Indian Country, and it's going to continue.</p>, <p>Thank you all.</p>, <p><i>Infrastructure, Jobs, Education, and Family Assistance Legislation </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, are you confident that Build Back Better will pass the House?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> You ask me that all the time, and I give you the same answer. I've been confident since the day I stepped into office.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, what do you hope to accomplish in your meeting with President Xi tonight?</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, what are you going to talk to President Xi about?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Are you hoping to lower the temperature with China?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>What are you going to talk to President Xi about?</p>]"

2,9,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks in a Cabinet Meeting,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-cabinet-meeting-1,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Well, I thank you all for being here. I want to thank Vice President Harris, who is on the line. I asked her to go to Paris to meet with Macron—with President Macron—and to work on some things relating to Libya and a few other things. And thanks. I—Madam Vice President, in a little while, after this is over, maybe we can talk and see how things are going okay for you. All right?</p>, <p><i>Vice President Kamala D. Harris.</i> I'd like that. Thank you, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Okay.</p>, <p>And we've gathered my Cabinet this afternoon at a moment of immense hope and possibility, in our view, for the United States. The American people sent us here to deliver. The American people said—they sent us here to make their Government work, and they sent us here to make a difference in their lives. And I believe we're doing that. I believe that's just what we're doing.</p>, <p>On Monday, I look forward to signing into law the Infrastructure Act—the Investment and Jobs Act, which we'll do outside, God willing, if the weather—the weather holding. And it's going—you know, it was a lot of hard work to get it done. I know it was probably hard work for all the press here to watch me try to get it done. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But I want to thank them for acknowledging that this was a bipartisan bill—it was bipartisan support—and proving we can still come together. It's hard, but we can still come together to get something big done for the American people.</p>, <p>And the bill represents critical investments that are long overdue in our country: from rebuilding our roads and highways, to getting rid of the lead pipes; delivering clean water to thousands of families—tens—actually, millions of people around the Nation; to making high-speed internet accessible to every American, rural and urban; to forfeiting—to fortifying our bridges and power lines and levees that stand up to the increasing threats posed by extreme weather and superstorms. And we have $99 billion worth of losses just this year because of the consequence of those environmental events. To fortifying our bridges, our power lines, as I said, and our levees. But also to—one of our biggest responsibilities is to make sure all the money is used efficiently and effectively.</p>, <p>And I have a lot of experience in doing that. I—when the—when I was Vice President, I was given the responsibility of overseeing, as my—now running the Vets Department, but my—the former—the former Chief of Staff of—I was saying here to Denis, who can tell you—of implementing the Recovery Act, which was nearly $9 billion in stimulus package—$900 billion stimulus package.</p>, <p>And in the process, I'm proud to say we were able to—the President gave me the authority—which I will be signing as well—the—to use whatever assets the Federal Government had—any personnel in the Federal Government. And we put together a good team because we—when we finished implementing the Recovery Act, it was determined that it had less than two-tenths of 1 percent waste or fraud. Period.</p>, <p>I was—that's how I became known. [<i>Laughter</i>] The President started calling me ""Sheriff Joe,"" but—from President Obama at the time. Because I made it a point, every day, to stay on top of how exactly the money was spent, what projects were being built, what projects were not being built, and how it was functioning. And it was one of the most efficient implementations of a major program in modern American history.</p>, <p>Well, it is my intention to see to it that the act we just passed and we're going to sign on Monday does—meets the same standard. We owe it to the American people to make sure the money in this infrastructure plan and the Build Back Better plan—which, God willing, we're going to be able to still finish—will be able to be used for purposes it was intended.</p>, <p>So that's what I want to talk to my Cabinet about today and the high obligation and responsibility that we all have to make sure this money is used wisely, used well, and used for the stated purposes for the American people.</p>, <p>Because if we do it right, we know what it will mean. We know what it will mean. It will create millions of new jobs, it will grow the economy, and we'll win the world economic competition that we're engaged in in the second quarter of the 21st century with China and many other countries around the world.</p>, <p>And we're going to—we'll see ease—and I say, yes, ""ease""—lower inflationary pressures on our economy. And we'll be carrying this out—what I call the blue-collar blueprint for America, one that builds the economy from the bottom up and the middle out and one not from the top down.</p>, <p>And so I want to thank you all for being here. That's what we're going to discuss today. And next week, I'll have further announcements of exactly who's going to be put in charge of how we do this.</p>, <p>So thank you all so very much.</p>]"
3,0,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks at a Veterans Day Ceremony in Arlington, Virginia",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-veterans-day-ceremony-arlington-virginia-16,"[<p>Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.</p>, <p>Folks, being President of the United States, you are afforded many opportunities to try to express your love, commitment, and admiration for the American people. And I must say to you that the single greatest honor I've been afforded as President is to stand before so many of you, those Medal of Honor winners out there, and talk about Veterans Day and veterans.</p>, <p>I want to welcome all the Cabinet members and honored guests joining us today, including the father of our Secretary of State, who served in the Army Air Corps during World War II, Ambassador Donald Blinken, whose birthday is today. Happy Birthday. Thank you for your service to our country.</p>, <p>And I just want to tell you, I know you're a little younger than I am, but you know, I've adopted the attitude of the great Negro—at the time, pitcher in the Negro Leagues—went on to become a great pitcher in the pros—into the Major League Baseball after Jackie Robinson. His name was Satchel Paige.</p>, <p>And Satchel Paige, on his 47th birthday, pitched a win against Chicago. [<i>Laughter</i>] And all the press went in and said: ""Satch, it's amazing—47 years old. No one's ever, ever pitched a win at age 47. How do you feel about being 47?"" He said, ""Boys, that's not how I look at it."" They said, ""How do you look at it, Satch?"" He said, ""I look at it this way: How old would you be if you didn't know how old you were?""</p>, <p>I'm 50 years old, and the Ambassador is 47. [<i>Laughter</i>] But all kidding aside, Mr. Ambassador, thank you for your service during World War II, as well as your service as an Ambassador. And thank you for raising such a fine man, Tony Blinken, our Secretary of State.</p>, <p>To all our veterans, past and present, we thank you, we honor you, and we remember always what you've done for us.</p>, <p>I'd like to recognize one of our national heroes who is here today: Medal of Honor recipient, Mr. Brian Thacker. During the Vietnam war, then-First Lieutenant Thacker put the safety of his fellow troops above his own, providing cover fire against an attacking enemy, and even calling in artillery fire on his own position so our forces had a better chance to withdraw.</p>, <p>Wounded, unable to leave the area, he evaded capture for 8 days until finally Federal—friendly forces retook the position. Yours is a remarkable story; it will never be forgotten.</p>, <p>And we'll also never forget the stories of American leaders and icons we've lost recently who shaped our Nation in ways that are hard to measure. I've lost, like many of you, three good friends in the last month:</p>, <p>General Colin Powell, a child of immigrants, who grew up to be the joint—Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of State. A man who was a friend, but who earned the universal respect of the Americans and people for his leadership in uniform and out.</p>, <p>And a guy who became good friends in many times I was in and out of Iraq as a Vice President and a Senator, General Ray Odierno, who I met multiple times in Iraq and who did so much to help get us to where we are today and who always put the troops and its veterans first. It was an honor to have my son, Major Biden, serve under his command at the time.</p>, <p>And my friend and colleague—who was mentioned already—the United States Senator, Max Cleland, who, as a triple amputee, knew the cost of war as well as anyone could ever know it and went on to champion the dignity and care of America's wounded veterans throughout his life.</p>, <p>We lost all three of these incredible veterans in the last several weeks, and our hearts go out to their families. These are stories that inspire generation after generation of Americans to step forward to defend our Nation. And today we pay homage to the unrelenting bravery and dedication that distinguish all those who have earned the title of ""American veteran.""</p>, <p>It's an honor that not only a small percentage of Americans can claim, and one that marks those who are able to claim it as brothers and sisters. It's a badge of courage that unites across all ages, regardless of background, because to be a veteran is to have endured and survived challenges most Americans will never know.</p>, <p>You've come through the trials and testing, braved dangers and deprivations, faced down the tragic realities of war and death. And you've done it for us. You've done it for America: to defend and serve American values, to protect our country and our Constitution against all enemies, and to lay a stronger, more secure foundation on which future generations can continue to build a more perfect Union.</p>, <p>Each of our veterans is a link in a proud chain of patriots that has stood in the defense of our country from Bunker Hill to Belleau Woods, Gettysburg to Iwo Jima, Chosin Reservoir to Kunar Valley. Each—each—understood the price of freedom, and each shouldered that burden on our behalf.</p>, <p>Our veterans represent the best of America. You are the very spine of America, not just the backbone. You're the spine of this country. And all of us—all of us—owe you. And so, on Veterans Day and every day, we honor that great debt and recommit ourselves to keeping our sacred obligation as a nation to honor what you've done.</p>, <p>We have many obligations to our children, to our elderly, to those truly in need. But I've gotten in trouble way back when I was a young Senator for saying we only have one truly sacred obligation. We have many obligations, but one truly sacred obligation: to properly prepare those and equip those who we send into harm's way and care for them and their families while they're both deployed and when they return home. This is a lifetime sacred commitment. It never expires.</p>, <p>And for me and for Jill and for the entire Biden family: It's personal. When Beau was deployed to Iraq, after spending 6 months in Kosovo as an assistant U.S. attorney trying to help—he was trying to set up a criminal justice system, I got a call from him one day. He said, ""Dad, what are you doing Friday?"" And I said: ""What do you need, hon? I'm—what do you need?"" He said, ""I'd like you to pin my bars on."" I said, ""What in the heck have you done?"" He said, ""Someone's got to finish these wars, dad."" True story.</p>, <p>Jill and I learned what it meant to pray every day for the safe return of someone you love. So many of you have done that. Our grandkids learned what it meant to have their dad overseas in a war zone instead of back at home, for a year, tucking them into bed and reading that story every night. Thousands of Americans—tens of thousands—have had that experience.</p>, <p>As the English poet John Milton wrote, ""They also serve who only stand and wait."" To all the mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, spouses—all those who stand alongside our veterans—and their families, caregivers, survivors: You are the solid steel spine that bears up under every burden, the courageous heart that rises to every challenge. We've asked so much of you for so long, and our Nation is grateful.</p>, <p>For two decades, the lives of our servicemembers and their families and veterans have been shaped by the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 9/11, hundreds of thousands of Americans have served. So many are still serving today in harm's way, and we cannot forget them. The American people are forever grateful and in awe of what you've accomplished.</p>, <p>But in fulfilling their mission, so many veterans and their families and caregivers have been through hell. Some facing deployments after deployment, spending months and years away from their families, missing birthdays, the anniversaries, and collections [celebrations].*</p>, <p>I remember one of the last times I flew into Iraq, in the so-called ""Silver Bullet."" I remember walking up to the cockpit. And the crewmasters along with the pilots were up there, and I said, ""How many of you is this your first tour?"" No one raised their hand. There were five people. ""Second tour?"" No one raised their hand. ""Third tour?"" Two raised their hand. ""Fourth tour?"" Two raised their hand. ""Fifth?"" One raised their hand.</p>, <p>Folks, on Veterans Day we have to always remember that there's nothing low-risk or low-cost about war for the women and men who fight it. I carry with me, in my pocket, every single day—I have my staff check with the Defense Department—on the back of my schedule I have U.S. daily troops in Afghanistan, killed and wounded; U.S. daily troops in Iraq, killed and wounded: 52,323 [53,323]*—not ""roughly 53,000""—every one of these individuals has a family, has a unit at home.</p>, <p>Fifty-three thousand three hundred and twenty-three American service men and women wounded in the conflicts of Iraq and Afghanistan; 7,074 gave their lives, the last full measure of their devotion. Untold thousands more returned home—as our Secretary can tell you—with unseen psychological wounds of war, the enduring grief borne by our Gold Star families. These are the costs of war that they'll carry—we'll carry as a nation for decades to come.</p>, <p>And to all veterans, servicemembers, their families, caregivers, survivors: I want you to know that our administration is going to meet the sacred obligation that we owe you. We're going to work with Congress—Republicans and Democrats together—to make sure our veterans receive the world-class benefits that they've earned and meet the sacred—the specific care—specific needs that they each individually need.</p>, <p>That means expanding presumptive conditions for toxic exposure and particulate matter, including Agent Orange and burn pits. We're going to keep pushing on this front to be more nimble and responsive. We're reviewing all the data and evidence to determine additional presumptive conditions that make sure our veterans don't have to wait to get the care they need.</p>, <p>It also means prioritizing mental health care that is necessary to treat the invisible wounds that so many of our veterans carry, including pursuing our newly released comprehensive public health strategy to reduce military and veteran suicides.</p>, <p>I want to say clearly to all our veterans: If you're struggling—you're so used to never asking for anything. If you're struggling, reach out. Call the Veterans Crisis Line. If you're having trouble thinking about things, it's no different than if you had a wound in your arm.</p>, <p>And making—it's also making sure that the growing population of women and LGBTQ+ veterans receive appropriate services and support.</p>, <p>And as we continue our efforts to defeat the pandemic and build back better, it means keeping the needs of veterans front and center. The American Rescue Plan included $17 billion to support VA's COVID-19 response, to get vaccination—vaccine shots in arms as fast as possible, and to fund programs that provide rapid retraining assistance for veterans who may have lost their jobs in the pandemic, housing assistance, debt forgiveness, and to invest in improving VA facilities and the living conditions of vulnerable veterans.</p>, <p>Through Jill's work of Joining Forces, we're also working to support our veterans and military families, survivors, and caregivers so they can have what they need to thrive. They deserve it.</p>, <p>As Secretary McDonough noted, this Veterans Day also marks the centennial of one of the most hallowed American monuments: the Tomb of the Unknowns. A hundred years ago today, an American soldier of the First World War—as the tomb says, ""known but to God,"" end of quote—completed the voyage from an unidentified battlefield in France, over the rough Atlantic seas, here to Arlington National Cemetery. He lay in state under the Capitol Rotunda for 2 days on the same plinth that held the body of Lincoln, as 90,000 Americans came to pay respects.</p>, <p>On the final leg of his journey, he was escorted from the Capitol by the President of the United States, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Members of Congress, General Pershing, and the Chiefs of Staff—Medal of Honor recipients all walking, as the Washington Post said, processing ""without parallel"" to give honor due to American servicemen—American servicemembers—not just the anonymous soul today entombed in gleaming marble, but the generations of Americans who dared all, risked all, gave all for the cause of freedom.</p>, <p>To commemorate, in the wounds of the Member—in the words of a Member of Congress who proposed the legislation creating the memorial, an American warrior who, quote—and this is the quote—who ""typifies . . . the soul of America."" You veterans are the soul of America. America's soul.</p>, <p>It's why our veterans have always fought, always been willing to put themselves on the line. That the first unknown lies now with his brethren, unnamed warriors from later wars fellow patriots who picked up the mantle of honor and made it their burden.</p>, <p>And today, a hundred years later, we keep a sacred watch over their graves. Generations of elite sentinels have taken the post, pledging their ""eternal vigilance."" We lay wreaths. We renew our oaths. We stand in solemn awe of such fidelity. Because for us to keep faith with American veterans, we must never forget exactly what was given to us, what each of them was willing to put on the line for us.</p>, <p>And we must never forget that it is the mighty arm of the American warrior—never bending, never breaking, never yielding—generation after generation that secured for us the blessings of a nation that still stands today as a beacon of liberty, democracy, and justice around the world.</p>, <p>May God bless you all, God bless all American veterans and those who proudly earned that title, and may God protect our troops.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>]"
3,1,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in Baltimore, Maryland",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-baltimore-maryland,"[<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you. We have an expression—we used to have an expression when I served in the Senate—Senator Van Hollen—they said—when they wanted to make some statement that was personal, they'd say, ""A point of personal privilege.""</p>, <p>You know, when you were talking about being a waterman, working on the water—my family is originally from Baltimore, came in the early 1800s. And the entire Biden family worked in the water—were watermen until probably 1906, -7, or -8. And my father was raised here in Baltimore. They don't say ""Baltimore."" They say ""Bawltamer."" And so, you know, although they never worked at the port, they did work in the bay and along here.</p>, <p>So, you know, this has been—this is one the oldest ports in the country continuously running and one of the best ports in the country.</p>, <p>And so, Tony, thanks for that introduction. And, Mayor Scott, thanks for the passport into the city. I appreciate it very much. And I want to thank Governor Hogan for being here and Members of the delegation.</p>, <p>I want start off with one of my best buddies and, I think, one of the most effective people in the United States Senate, Chris Van Hollen. Don't—if you need something, go to him, man. He knows how to get it done.</p>, <p>And also, Dutch Ruppersberger. And a guy who—I knew him when he was a kid. He doesn't remember me. I'm getting so old; I knew his dad, Senator Sarbanes. And Congressman Sarbanes, Congressman Brown, and all of this delegation. You've got a first-rate delegation.</p>, <p>And so I want to thank them for being here today and thank them for all the help in getting the Members of the House and getting the legislation passed. It's a big deal. It's going to make a big difference.</p>, <p>The reason I started calling this ""Build Back Better"" is, we're the only country in the world—we underestimate ourselves; we're sort of down on ourselves the last 10 years or so—we're the only country in the world, as a matter of history, that every crisis we've faced, we've come out better on the other side. We not only beat it—not a joke, think about it—we've come out better than we were before we went into the crisis.</p>, <p>And the economic and political, as well as health crisis we found with COVID—I was determined, when we got elected, we've got to build it back better than it was. Because the world is changing so rapidly—so rapidly, man. We've got to keep up. We're in competition to determine whether or not we can still remain the most powerful economic force in the world.</p>, <p>And so today I'm here to talk about one of the most pressing economic concerns of the American people—and it's real. And that is: getting prices down, number one; number two, making sure our stores are fully stocked; and number three, getting a lot of people back to work while tracking and tackling these two above challenges I mentioned.</p>, <p>Today's economic reports showing unemployment continued to fall, but consumer prices remain too high. Tell us—the American people, in the midst of an economic crisis, that recovery is showing strong results, but not to them. They're still looking out there. Everything from a gallon of gas to loaf of bread costs more. And it's worrisome, even though wages are going up.</p>, <p>We still face challenges, and we have to tackle them. We have to tackle them head on.</p>, <p>And on the good side, we're seeing the highest growth rate in decades, the fastest decrease in unemployment at this point ever since 1950. Jobs are up. Wages are up. Value is up. And savings are up. But we're—we've got problems too.</p>, <p>Many people remain unsettled about the economy, and we all know why. They see higher prices. They go to the store online, or they can't—or they go to the store—or go online, and they can't find what they always want and when they want it. And we're tracking these issues and trying to figure out how to tackle them head on.</p>, <p>My administration, with the help of the folks on my left over here, is—has a plan to finish the job at getting us back to normal from the pandemic and having a stronger economy than we've ever had before.</p>, <p>Let me explain the part that the ports play and why they're so critically important. It starts with a piece of good news: Infrastructure week has finally arrived. How many times did you hear over the last 5 years ""Infrastructure week is coming""? [<i>Laughter</i>] Yes, uh-huh.</p>, <p>Anyway, but last week, we took a monumental step forward as a nation and we did something long overdue and long talked about in Washington, but almost never actually done: The House of Representatives passed my bipartisan infrastructure bill. Along with another—plans that I'm advancing, this bill is going to reduce the cost of goods to consumers and businesses and get people back to work, helping us build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out that—where everybody is better off.</p>, <p>You know, I'm tired of this trickle-down economy stuff. I come from Delaware—just across the line up here—and you know, we have more corporations in Delaware than every other nation in the State [State in the Nation]* combined. And so I understand big business. The fact of the matter is, it's time they start paying their fair share. The fact is, you have 55 corporations last year that, in fact, made $40 billion, didn't pay a single penny in taxes.</p>, <p>Nobody is going to—nobody is going to pay more—if you make less than 400 grand, you're not going to pay anything more in taxes at all. Period. Guaranteed. Including gasoline tax. Not going to—additional, from a Federal Government standpoint.</p>, <p>And so, look, this is a once-in-a-generation investment to create good-paying jobs, modernize our infrastructure, turn the climate crisis into an opportunity. When I talk climate to other world leaders, I say—think one thing: We're dealing with climate—think ""jobs."" Good jobs. Because that's how you beat the climate crisis.</p>, <p>Put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st century we face with China and the rest of the world. China is outspending us on research and development. China is outspending all these—these other countries are as well.</p>, <p>And here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to create good-paying union jobs—union. Not good jobs—not 12 dollars an hour, not 15 dollars an hour—45 bucks an hour and up with good benefits so you can raise a family on and build the middle class out. And jobs that cannot be outsourced; you can't outsource these jobs.</p>, <p>And I'm going to transform our transportation system with the most significant investment in passenger rail in the past 50 years; in roads and bridges—the most significant investment in 70 years; and investments in public transit that we've done over the period. You know, this is going to—it's going to modernize our ports with $17 billion in investment—$17 billion in investment.</p>, <p>We're going to reduce congestion. We're going to address repair and maintenance backlogs, deploy state-of-the-art technologies, and make our ports cleaner and more efficient. And we're going to do the same with our airports and freight rail.</p>, <p>We're going to create jobs replacing lead water pipes that are here in Maryland, as well as every other State in the Union, that are poisoning our kids and others.</p>, <p>We're going to make high-speed internet affordable and available to everywhere in America. Those of you who have kids in school when we we've been going to this hybrid thing—some in class, some out of class—how many times if you—if you don't live in an area where you have high-speed internet you can afford, how many times have you driven your kids to the parking lot of McDonald's and sat there going off the McDonald's internet so you could hear? No, I'm not joking. Think of this—United States of America, for God's sake.</p>, <p>So, folks, we're going to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle charging stations all across the country. IBEW is going to put in 500,000 charging stations across the country.</p>, <p>And guess what? That's in the Recovery Act—excuse me, that's in the Build Back Better bill, which is not going to raise taxes 1 single cent. It's totally paid for—totally paid for—by making taxes work for people who make over 400 grand and just do their fair share. I'm a capitalist, man. You should be able to be a millionaire or billionaire if you can. But pay your fair share. Pay something along the line.</p>, <p>I'm going to get America off the sidelines on manufacturing—the manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries to store energy and power the electric vehicles from schoolbuses to automobiles.</p>, <p>We're also going to make historic investments in environmental cleanup and remediation, rebuilding resilience against superstorms and droughts and wildfires and hurricanes. I traveled all over the country this year. You know, there's nine—literally, $99 billion in losses because of storms this year. Ninety-nine billion dollars.</p>, <p>You ever think you'd hear somebody stand up and say, ""The Colorado River is being drained""? Did you ever think you'd see—you'd go out—more wildfires in the West than the entire—and lost—land lost, homes lost—burned to the ground—I've flown over in Marine One—than the entire State of New Jersey, from the Cape all the way to New York. That's how much we've lost in America so far—so far.</p>, <p>And according to the economic experts, this bill is going to ease inflationary pressures, lowering the cost to working families. Seventeen—excuse me, yes, 17 Nobel laureates in economics wrote a letter to me about 10 days ago saying this is going to affect—bring inflation down, not up.</p>, <p>Best of all, the vast majority of these jobs are going to create—that we're going to create don't require a college degree—don't require it. This is the ultimate blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America.</p>, <p>I'm not waiting to sign a bill to start improving the flow of goods from ships to shelves. Yesterday I announced a port of—a port plan of action. It lays out concrete steps for my administration to take over the next 3 months to invest in our ports and to relieve bottlenecks.</p>, <p>This builds on the progress we've already made. Last month, I reached a deal with two of the largest ports in America, the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach. And I met with you guys, with the longshoremen there, and we worked out a deal between the port owners and the longshoremen to move toward operating those two ports.</p>, <p>Okay, 40 percent of everything in the Pacific comes through those two ports. And they're lined up—ships are lined up 70-some lined up out as far as you could see. So they all agreed they're going to go 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>, <p>It's already paying off. Last week, the number of container ships in the docks for more than 9 days fell by over 20 percent. And now we're announcing steps to improve ports on the East Coast to provide support for the Port of Savannah, the fourth largest container port in the country, to help reduce congestion.</p>, <p>With our help, they now have the funds they need to set up five new inland port sites in Georgia and North Carolina so goods can get closer to their final destination more quickly. And other ports across the country will have the resources they need to make these kinds of immediate investments as well.</p>, <p>The challenge we need to meet here, and that my plan is going to help address, has to do with the supply chain. You hear a lot about the supply chains in the news, but frankly, not a lot of people are clear—have a clear understanding, whether they have a Ph.D. or they didn't go to school, about how a supply chain works. It's easy to talk about it, but what's the impact on the economy, let alone how to fix it? It's perfectly understandable because supply chains are incredibly complex.</p>, <p>And as long as goods and materials are getting where they need to go on time, there's usually no need to worry about the supply chains. But when global disruptions hit, like a pandemic, they can hit supply chains particularly hard. COVID-19 has stretched global supply chains like never before. And suddenly, when you go to order a pair of sneakers or a bicycle or Christmas presents for the family, you're met with higher prices and long delays, or they say they just don't have any at all.</p>, <p>And the reason for that, last year, was—has a lot to do with most companies make their product—how they make their products today. In simple terms, supply chain is just the journey that a product takes to get to your doorstep: raw materials plus labor, assembly, shipping—everything it takes to create the finished product. These supply chains are complex.</p>, <p>Even products as simple as a pencil can—have to use wood from Brazil, graphite from India before it comes together at a factory in the United States to get a pencil. It sounds silly, but that's literally how it happens. So if, all of a sudden, you've got a COVID crisis in Brazil, you can't get the product maybe because the plant shuts down. That's what's happening.</p>, <p>Products like smartphones often bring together parts from France, Italy; chips from the Netherlands; touchscreens from New York State; camera components from Japan—a supply chain that crosses dozens of countries.</p>, <p>That's just the nature of a modern economy—the world economy. But global supply chains have helped dramatically bring down the price we pay for things we buy. But they've also made us much more reliant on what happens in other parts of the world.</p>, <p>So if a factory in Malaysia shuts down due to a COVID outbreak—which they have—it causes a ripple effect that can slow down auto manufacturing in Detroit. Why? They can't get the computer chips they need. If a climate disaster closes a port in China, it can delay shipment of furniture or clothing, reduce worldwide supply, and driving up prices here in America.</p>, <p>And the irony is: People have more money now because of the first major piece of legislation I passed. You all got checks for $1,400. You got checks for a whole range of things. If you're a mom and you have kids under the age of 7, you're getting 300 bucks a month, and if it's over 7 to 17, you're getting $360 a month—like wealthy people used to when they'd get back tax returns. It'd change people's lives.</p>, <p>But what happens if there's nothing to buy and you've got more money? You compete for getting it there. It creates a real problem. So, on the one hand, we're facing new disruptions to our supplies. But at the same time, we're also experiencing higher demand for goods because wages are up, as well as—as well as—people have money in the bank. And because of the strength of our economic recovery, American families have been able to buy more products.</p>, <p>And—but guess what? They're not going out to dinner and lunch and going to the local bars because of COVID. So what are they doing? They're staying home, they're ordering online, and they're buying product. Well, with more people with money buying product and less product to buy, what happens? The supply chain is the reason, and the answer is you guys—and I'll get to that in a minute—but what happens? Prices go up.</p>, <p>So we've got nearly 20 percent more goods coming into the country than we did before the pandemic struck. In 19 days—excuse me, COVID-19 has changed the way we spend our time and our money. More products are being delivered than ever before. That's because people have a little more breathing room than they did last year, and that's a good thing.</p>, <p>But it also means we got a higher demand for goods at the same time we're facing disruptions in the supplies to make those goods. There's a recipe—this is a recipe for delays and for higher prices, and people are feeling it. They're feeling it. Did you ever think you'd be paying this much for gas—a gallon of gas? In some parts of California, they're paying $4.50 a gallon.</p>, <p>That's why it's so important that we do everything in our power to stabilize the supply chain. And here's the good news: Yesterday I spoke with the CEOs—personally spoke with the CEOs of the major retailers—Walmart, Target—and the leading freight movers—FedEx and UPS. They assured me that the shelves will be stocked in stores this holiday because they signed on to 24/7 as well. They signed on to 24/7.</p>, <p>And they provide more avenues—they're getting more of their containers off the ports quicker than ever before. Because a lot of stuff on the ports, it was sitting around, staying there. Why? Because it no longer is the product they need at this moment. And it doesn't cost them anything to leave them sitting at the port, rather than in their warehouses. That's moving as well.</p>, <p>Part of the reason why is because my Port Envoy, John Porcari—who was the Secretary of Transportation here for two Governors—John has worked with the operators, the shippers—shipping companies and unions and retailers to speed commerce so they can get products to stores and to your doors and to get the shelves fully stocked this holiday season.</p>, <p>Instead of pointing fingers, we're seeing folks start to work together: railroads, ocean liners, labor, State and local governments. The progress has already begun. And now we passed the bipartisan infrastructure bill—the deal—it's only going to accelerate. You've heard me say it before: Infrastructure—infrastructure—used to be rated, in the United States, as the best in the world when I got to the Congress.</p>, <p>But today, according to the World Economic Forum, you know where we rank in infrastructure? Thirteenth in the world. Twelve countries in the world have more modern, efficient infrastructure than the United States of America.</p>, <p>By investing in our roads, our bridges, our ports, and so much else, this bill is going to make it easier for companies to get goods to market more quickly. Here in Baltimore, you've got a port that's older than America itself, and it's been operating for 315 years.</p>, <p>By the way, you've got any marines here—any former marines? Raise your hand. Well, if you're here as a marine, happy birthday. It's your 247th birthday—the United States Marine Corps. They deserve some applause.</p>, <p>Look, this port is connected to the Nation's oldest rail line, the B&amp;O Railroad, which in turn relies on the tunnels that are about 126 years old, those tunnels. Okay?</p>, <p>The tunnel has become a major bottleneck to the port. Now, the Port of Baltimore will be getting a $125 million grant to upgrade that tunnel so freight trains can come double-stacked through that tunnel—double-stacked with these cars—with containers on top of them. Twice as much. They move out a hell of a lot more quickly if they're going—if they're imports going out, but if they're exports—going across the ocean. That means, in addition to more good jobs being filled, more products on shelves delivered faster and lower prices.</p>, <p>It's about taking a long-term view of our economy to deliver lower costs, more jobs, and ensure our shelves are stocked with product. And the longer term view means building greater resilience to withstand both the shocks and disruptions we can anticipate as the world continues to change: pandemics, weather extremes, cyber attacks, whatever else comes our way. And they're all going to come our way. You know it. We need to be ready.</p>, <p>We need companies throughout the supply chain to create and support good-paying jobs for people that are—that they can grow in, build skills in, join a union, make a decent living.</p>, <p>That's when disruption hits—so when disruption hits, companies can quickly adapt because they're invested in their workers, their skills, their training, and a strong foundation of what—when I always think unions and my family, I think of dignity and respect. That's what it's about: dignity and respect.</p>, <p>Taking the longer term view also means making ""Buy American"" not just a promise, but an ironclad reality. When I got elected, I said we're going to—I get to ""spend""—quote, unquote—$600 billion of your money making everything from aircraft carriers to balloons. But guess what? So much of it has been going out and getting foreign contractors to do it. Well, this administration has been doing—we set new rules to strengthen our domestic supply chains with a new Made in America office within the White House.</p>, <p>Never again should our country be left unable to produce critical goods because we don't have access to the materials we need. Never again should we have to rely on one company or one country, particularly when the country doesn't share our values.</p>, <p>I've said it before: We're in a competition for the 21st century and who's going to own it. America still has the most productive workers in the world and the most innovative minds in the world. That's not hyperbole, that's a fact. But other countries are closing in. We risk losing our edge if we don't step up now.</p>, <p>This bipartisan infrastructure bill is a major step forward. It represents the biggest investment in ports in American history. And for American families, it means products moving faster and less expensively from factory floor, through the supply chain, to your home.</p>, <p>The bottom line is this: With the bill we passed last week and the steps we're taking to reduce bottlenecks at home and abroad, we're set to make significant progress.</p>, <p>We're already in the midst of a historic economic recovery. And thanks to those steps we're taking, very soon we're going to see the supply chain start catching up with demand. So not only will we see more record-breaking job growth, we'll see lower prices and faster deliveries as well.</p>, <p>This work is going to be critical as we implement the infrastructure bill and as we continue to build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out by passing the Build Back Better plan.</p>, <p>We need to unlock the full might and dynamism of our economy, guys, and of our people. I really mean it. And with this plan, we've set in motion what a—that's—what's—exactly what we're going to do: We're going to build a better America—not a joke. We're going to lead the world again—not a joke. We're going to be in a position where we once again own the 21st century, because when we own it, everybody does better. Everybody. Not only America, but around the world.</p>, <p>Sorry to take so long. And the Sun is down. You don't have any sweater on. You're going to freeze. I'm going to stop talking. [<i>Laughter</i>] A man with little—as little hair as mine just took his hat off. I'd put it back on. You're going to get cold if I don't step down.</p>, <p>But look, all kidding aside, I want to particularly thank the longshoremen. You guys—there's an old expression up in Claymont, Delaware, where I was from—y'all brung me to the dance, man. You've stuck with me from the first time I ran. And you've stepped up every time you've been asked—every time you've been asked. And I want to personally thank you while I'm standing in front of you.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and God bless all the workers that keep our economy going. And make God protect our troops. Thank you so very much. Thank you.</p>]"
3,2,Joseph R. Biden,"Eulogy at the Funeral of Former Governor Ruth Ann Minner of Delaware in Milford, Delaware",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-the-funeral-former-governor-ruth-ann-minner-delaware-milford-delaware,"[<p>Well, Tommy, you left it to me. [<i>Laughter</i>] We all brought our weapons. I brought my rosary. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've got a story about that with Ruth Ann.</p>, <p>Folks, to our beloved Delaware, to our beloved nation, and to our beloved family: Here in Milford, in this house of God, we find truth in the old proverb, ""A good example is the best sermon."" To me, that was Ruth Ann. ""A good example is the best sermon.""</p>, <p>Ruth Ann was, without engaging in hyperbole, one of the—Delaware's real, true pioneers, one of the most remarkable and inspirational people I got to meet. I didn't know her—I knew her extremely well, I thought, but not in the same way that the earlier speakers have known her, working with her every single day.</p>, <p>Ruth Ann and I, we'd talk when one of us were in trouble politically or one of—[<i>laughter</i>]—or one of us were seeking advice from the other person. I mean that sincerely.</p>, <p>And she was one of the most remarkable, inspirational people that Jill and I have met and that our family has ever known. And we've met a lot of people. We've met a lot of successful women at home and internationally. Ruth Ann had something different than almost everybody I've ever worked with.</p>, <p>Mr. Lindell—Lindale, I should say; Governor Carney; Governor Carper; the Right Reverend Blunt Rochester—[<i>laughter</i>]—that girl can preach; Governor Markell; and the Minner family: Look, in Delaware, we know the power of her example, and we know it pretty well. Every one of us in these pews had some interaction with Ruth Ann, beyond the family. But it's one that every American should know—her example. And I mean this sincerely.</p>, <p>Because of the generosity of the people of Delaware, I had an opportunity to meet virtually every serious, well-known person in the world that—because of the nature of my job. And I'd not often, but occasionally, talk about Ruth Ann when they'd ask me about, ""Can you tell me about—can you define America for me?"" Not a joke. And I'd talk about—it's just about opportunity. And it's about being able to dream something beyond your circumstance and have some shot being able to get there.</p>, <p>But it's not just learning that she was elected to the House of Delaware—it's not just learning about that—or that she went to the Delaware Senate, Lieutenant Governor, or as the first woman Governor. But it's how she got there, which I think, Nance, is what it's all about, how she did it.</p>, <p>It's how each time she climbed up the political ladder, she always stayed grounded in the lives of everyday people—whether it was the folks at the corner store, whether it was her neighbors, whether it was her family. Just ordinary people—that's what she and I—when we'd talk, we'd talk about.</p>, <p>I remember when I did the Inaugural. I said, ""This is about just—never once, when we've given the American people a shot—just a shot—never one single time has the American people—ordinary people—ever, ever let us down.""</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, a cell phone rang</i>.]</p>, <p>That's okay. That's—[<i>laughter</i>]. That's Ruth Ann saying, ""Keep going, Joe."" [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But you know, the thing is, Ruth Ann had that—that ""something special"" my mom would talk about, in that she had a sense of empathy. She understood. She understood. When she looked at you and talked to you, especially if it was a crisis, you knew she understood.</p>, <p>You know, and the American people should know that she was a Governor who once, as a teenager, dropped out of school to—you all know it, but the American people should know it—dropped out of school to help run the family farm. It sounds like fairy-tale stuff, but it's real. It happened.</p>, <p>As a young widow who, after Frank suddenly passed away, decided that she's going to get her GED while working two jobs and raising three boys—easy to read, hard as the devil to do.</p>, <p>An entrepreneur who helped build a successful auto-towing company that the boys ran. A pathbreaker who—I remember this one, because I was doing the same thing with less efficiency as a member of the banking committee—which was when she went to get that loan and needed a signature of her husband. She and I talked about this. She needed—she couldn't get it because her husband needed to sign it.</p>, <p>And after going out to the elected officials and saying, ""Can we do something about this?"" she decided the best way was to change the law, was to write it herself. She determined to do it, and she did it. Not a lot of highfalutin speeches or anything, she just did it.</p>, <p>And you know, no wonder she was such a tireless champion of education in Delaware—for a better education for every Delawarean. Ruth Ann was a student at Del Tech, where after—before my wife, Jill, taught there for years and years. The reason Jill is not with me today is, she's teaching today, fulltime as a professor at Northern Virginia Community College.</p>, <p>Ruth Ann was a student there—Del Tech. Just as smart and as talented as anyone else that was there, but just looking for a chance to get ahead. Not asking for anything, just a shot. ""Let me get a credential. Just give me a shot.""</p>, <p>No wonder she was a tireless champion in protecting Delaware's public lands and waters. It sounds corny, but she was a farmer's daughter. She understood it. She understood the consequence.</p>, <p>One of the few times—I say to the Governors here—that she called me about working with Harkins from Iowa to make sure we put away a lot of land—one of the reasons why. And I called her when—we're going to lay aside more land for farmers—and they get paid for doing it—than any time in American history if my bills go through. That's Ruth Ann. It's about the next generation, not just this one. She never talked about it that way. She just talked about it like this was the right thing to do.</p>, <p>You know, having watched Roger pass from cancer caused her to lead the effort to create the Delaware Cancer Consortium to increase screening, lower incidence rates of cancer, help end—as Jill and I talk about—ending cancer as we know it. When Jill started the breast cancer initiative—things have changed a long time ago—and Ruth Ann was one of the first people to call her.</p>, <p>Tommy, when I raised breast health—cancer—and breast health and cancer initiatives in the United States Senate, Bob Byrd showed me, under the Senate rules, I wasn't able to use the word ""breast"" on the floor the United States Senate. Not a joke. Not a joke. How much has changed because of Ruth Ann, because of the tireless, incredibly large number of mostly women that she encouraged?</p>, <p>You know, it's no wonder she was so unwavering on questions of principle, because that's what drove her. And as was stated by the Gov, Ruth Ann understood the—an elected office is about what you're willing to lose over, not what you're willing to do when you win.</p>, <p>When I got elected as a 29-year-old kid to the Senate—beating Caleb Boggs, a really fine man who endorsed me when I ran the second time—the thing I—people would come up to me and say, ""Well, what's the secret?"" Because if I won—this kid—this Irish Catholic kid from Claymont, Delaware, who didn't have the proverbial pot—how could this happen? There had to be a secret. They'd literally ask me, ""What's the secret?""</p>, <p>The secret is represented by the women and men who have spoken already. ""What are you willing to lose over?"" If you haven't figured that out, you should never run for office. Go into another enterprise. You'd make a lot more money, and you get a lot less heat. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, I'm serious. What difference does it make if you're not doing what you believe?</p>, <p>So, you know—and I, like all of you, remember when she decided that protecting the health of Delawareans from cigarette smoke at a time when opponents would chant, ""Ban Ruth Ann."" Remember that? ""Ban Ruth Ann. Ban Ruth Ann."" Remember what she'd say? I remember. She would say, ""Why should the life and health of a restaurant worker be valued less than anybody else's?"" Because I believe that's how she thought about it.</p>, <p>What made her so powerful: She expressed what she really thought and felt. Didn't have to be clothed—cloaked in poetic language, just what she thought. Everybody understood what she meant. She worried about that waitress who was making 5 bucks an hour, busting her neck, breathing in that smoke. That's who she cared about, and people knew it.</p>, <p>You know, like many people here, I can honestly say that, but for the love of my family and the grace of God, I wouldn't be here today without Ruth Ann's support. She was always there for me, for us, for my beloved Beau. I think she cared about him, guys. I think she really cared about him.</p>, <p>Beau was elected attorney general when Ruth Ann was Governor. And the thing that surprised her most was she was ready to appoint him attorney general—[<i>laughter</i>]—and he wouldn't do it. He had too much of Ruth Ann in him. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But no kidding. You remember that? He wouldn't do it. He said, ""I'm going to run for it."" He couldn't have asked for a better angel to have on his shoulder than Ruth Ann. He respected her, he looked up to her, and I think she respected him. Like Ruth Ann, Beau walked among the people. When we lost him, Ruth Ann understood.</p>, <p>The Minner family knows how, when you have serious loss, people go up and say, ""I know how you feel."" And you know they mean well. But after a while, especially if you're well known, you feel like saying, ""You have no damn idea how I feel."" You know they mean well.</p>, <p>When someone comes up, like Ruth Ann, who's has lost two husbands, lost a son, and said, ""Joe, I know how you feel,"" you know she knows. And just seeing her continue to walk, continue to speak out, continue to embrace the family that's left, you think to yourself, ""Maybe I can do that.""</p>, <p>Many of you have had significant loss. You know, when it happens, you feel like there's a black hole in your chest, you're being sucked into it. But there's certain people who come along; just by talking to you, they kind of reach down and keep you from sinking. Ruth Ann was one of those people that helped a lot, particularly for Jill.</p>, <p>You know, to America, let her be remembered as a leader who understood that democracy was a lot more than a form of government. Democracy is a way of being. It begins and grows in an open heart and with a willingness to come together by searching to find a common cause—not always the same exact answer, but a common cause. If you get to that point, there's nothing we can't solve if you acknowledge the common cause. And your grandmom and your great-grandmom knew how to do that. She reached out.</p>, <p>And you know, empathy is the fuel of democracy. I've learned, over time, it's the single most—how can I—underappreciated aspect of what makes governments work when they work. It's that sense of empathy, that thing that just says—you have a leader who says, ""That person knows what I'm going through.""</p>, <p>I was being reminded by my son Hunter, when I was trying to get the COP26—what's going on over in Europe on the environment—together, it makes a lot of difference. All empathy is looking at you and understanding what you're worried about. And you know and I know what you're worried about.</p>, <p>You know, one of my favorite quotes—I used to stutter badly when I was a kid. And I had a book of Emerson's—Ralph Waldo Emerson's saying on my—on the bureau with—I shared in a three-bedroom, split-level house—it was a decent place—with my two brothers—three brothers and—two brothers and I, and then a third brother came along.</p>, <p>But I used to get up in the middle of the night, and I'd—when everybody was asleep—and get a flashlight out. And I'd try to learn how to speak without—without—just—without making a fool of myself. And I'd shine it on the bottom of the mirror in this room we had where the four of us slept. And what would happen is that I'd try to keep my face from getting contorted when a stutter—go, go—and you just feel foolish.</p>, <p>And one of the things that I remember is—one of Emerson's quotes was, ""Society is [like] a wave. The wave moves"" on, but the particles remain the same. Meaning, God ain't made a new brand of man or woman in millennia or a lot longer.</p>, <p>And Ruth Ann kind of understood that. Whether she'd say it that way or not, I don't know. She understood that human beings are human beings. And you know—and she understood, I think, what a lot of us forget and, as President of the United States of America, I try to remind myself almost every day: Government is about making sure the system works—it functions, it works for people, you can deliver something to them.</p>, <p>Ruth Ann's love for the people of Delaware was really extraordinary, and we loved her back here in Delaware. She knew that while we have never made real the full promise of America for all Americans, every single generation has just kicked the clock up just a little bit closer. We've made slow, but consistent progress, opened a little wider.</p>, <p>And it's like the phrase used that she was more progressive than everybody thought, even though she would never think of herself as progressive. But the progressive part is: Society is like a wave. The wave moves on. The particles, the people don't change.</p>, <p>You know, the mission she now leaves us as a way forward is that's the power of Ruth Ann's example. If all of America—this is—if I were back teaching, I'd teach a course in Ruth Ann Minner. [<i>Laughter</i>] Seriously. Think about it. Think of what she did. A bright woman from humble circumstances. No fanfare. Not a whole lot of hollering and shouting. Just got up every morning and put one foot in front of the other.</p>, <p>Tommy knows—knew my dad. My dad would say just one thing: ""If you get knocked down, get up. Just get up. Get up."" His other expression was, ""Never complain and never explain.""</p>, <p>Well, you know, from our history, there's hope for the future—from solace, to strength. From our hearts, we continue to work for democracy. This was Ruth Ann's and my view—how she viewed things. Work of our time—of all time—and the life of Ruth Ann Minner: ""Just keep moving forward. Don't stop. Don't quit.""</p>, <p>To all of you who have worked alongside her, I want to thank you for your service and carrying on her legacy. And to her family—to Frank and Margaret, and Wayne and Phyllis, and Cindy and in Gary's memory, and to all of the grandchildren and children: The Bible teaches, as was referenced earlier, ""Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.""</p>, <p>While comfort can be a long time in coming, if you have faith, I promise you—and hold onto one another—it will come, and it will give you a purpose in Ruth Ann's memory. For real.</p>, <p>There's an anthem that means a lot to the Bidens that I quoted in my Inaugural Address—and, I might add, on election night, when it was unusual, because we didn't get to have one of those big events, et cetera—it was down at the Riverfront—I walked out on that stage to accept the win. And who was the first person I saw—[<i>laughter</i>]—in an automobile in front of me, standing on a car? Ruth Ann Minner.</p>, <p>Just like when I decided to run for the Senate. I came down—well, I was told—in 1972, this kid from Delaware had been a public defender, a civil rights guy. And I was coming down to Milford. I thought, ""I'm in hostile territory, man."" [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>My politics wasn't what everybody expected. But your mom greeted me. Your mom went out and talked about me. Your mom brought the family and her friends together. That's when I figured out: All I need in Milford is Ruth Ann. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But you know, this anthem is one that I don't think she knew, but one that is—means a lot in my family that I used in my Inaugural Address for being sworn in as President. It goes like this. It's called the ""American Anthem."" It says:</p>, <p>The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day.</p>, <p>What shall our legacy be? What will our children say?</p>, <p>Let me know in my heart that when my days are through</p>, <p>America, America, I did my best for you.</p>, <p>Ruth Ann gave her best to Delaware. She gave her best to America. May God bless you, dear friend. May God bless America and Ruth Ann Minner.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>]"
3,3,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks During a Virtual Fundraising Reception for the Democratic National Committee,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-during-virtual-fundraising-reception-for-the-democratic-national-committee,"[<p>Well, Eddie, thank you. I tell you what: You have me as your President. You know, I notice Scranton acted first; they have an exit—the Joe Biden Parkway. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>So, I tell you what—and, Ed, I know you'll believe this, but when I—I'm going to get in trouble with my folks in Delaware—but on election night, I wanted to get one election result: what—how I did in Scranton. And I won every precinct, Eddie. So my mom is looking down; she's smiling.</p>, <p>But look, thanks for your friendship more than anything else. And, Ken, thank you as well. It's been wonderful to see so many friends. And I want to thank you all for your incredible support.</p>, <p>You know, because of you guys—and you started it all—I never thought I could even remotely raise enough money to be competitive with the Trump Organization, and we raised an incredible amount of money for me. And it put me in the game.</p>, <p>And Kamala and I were sent here by the American people to deliver, and that's what we're trying to do. You know, after—as I said jokingly, when I announced it—after years of ""Infrastructure Week""—[<i>laughter</i>]—we finally followed through and just passed a monumental piece of legislation.</p>, <p>It's going to create millions of jobs—and that's not just me; that's coming from Wall Street as well as think tanks—and to grow our economy to make us more competitive and take a giant step forward on dealing with the climate crisis—over half a billion dollars, more than that—in terms of dealing with the climate crisis: electric vehicles, charging stations, a whole range of things.</p>, <p>It's the most significant investment in passenger rail in the past 50 years, the most significant investment in bridges and roads in our States in the last 70 years, and the most significant investment in public transit ever.</p>, <p>We're going to modernize our ports, our airports, freight rail, and to make it easy for companies to get their goods to market, reduce supply chain bottlenecks, and lower the cost to working families.</p>, <p>We're going to replace lead pipes in every—so every American can drink clean water. And that will take—going to cost several billion dollars. And every American is going to have access to high-speed internet, because a lot of them don't right now.</p>, <p>We're going to see new fleets of electric vehicles and schoolbuses, a national network of charging stations so you can charge up and drive all the way across the country with your kids and not worry about whether you're having—not going to be able to charge again.</p>, <p>And there's so much more. But the bottom line is, the legislation is going to change the lives of the American people.</p>, <p>And they expected us to deliver when they elected us, and we did. And now we need to do it again with the Build Back Better Initiative for struggling families with childcare, eldercare. And it's going to be a life-changer.</p>, <p>There's 2 million women who can't get back to work because they have to deal with childcare—or eldercare, for that matter—the sandwich generation getting caught between both. And it's going to be good for them and their families and for the economy.</p>, <p>There's universal pre-K—3 and 4 years old, as you mentioned, Ed—it's going to increase academic achievement. It's estimated by some of the great universities in the country studying this the last 10 years that it's going to increase the prospect of a kid coming from a home where they don't have books or they haven't heard that many words—they're going to put them in a position to compete with every other child in America, increasing by 56 percent the chance they'll get all the way through 12 years of school and go on to beyond high school.</p>, <p>And we're going to lower the prescription drug costs, cut taxes for working people and middle class—by the way, this bill doesn't cost a cent. We're going to—you know, and together with the infrastructure bill, we're going to make significant investments on the most significant—significant investment ever in dealing with the climate crisis and turn it into an opportunity in a jobs bill.</p>, <p>And all this is paid for by making sure that big corporations start to pay their fair share. There are 52 who—55 didn't pay a cent and made $40 billion. You know, it's not just them, but I—you guys both know, you all know I'm a capitalist; I'm not a socialist. But it's about time everybody just pay a little bit, pay their fair share.</p>, <p>It's fair, it's fiscally responsible, and it's paid for—plus one more thing: It extends the refundable childcare tax credit I put in the American Rescue Plan that passed months ago, which has helped some 60 million children—60 million children. It helped cut child poverty in America by more than 40 percent this year. And it's one of the things I'm most proud of. And we have—and we've had some big news in the last few days.</p>, <p>And a COVID vaccine for children ages 5 to 12 has been approved. And it's going to give millions of American parents peace of mind. And it means we now have the tools to combat COVID-19. We have vaccine, booster shots, and soon, an antiviral pill that's going to prevent severe illness or death once you—if someone hadn't been vaccinated—you guys have still got to get vaccinated, but if you hadn't been vaccinated and you get sick, this is going to keep you from being hospitalized or dying. And that's critical not only for public health, but for our economy as well.</p>, <p>You know, just last week, we reported 500,000 jobs were created last month. And they upped the jobs number created in July and August by 250,000 or thereabouts. The job creation for the previous 2 months, it was adjusted upwards, and several hundred—200-and-some-thousand jobs.</p>, <p>And it means, over the course of my Presidency, we will have created 5 million jobs—new jobs—so far. It's the largest number of jobs any President has ever created up to this point in their Presidency.</p>, <p>Now, I know a lot of folks are—don't feel that progress out there, that we're making in the economy. I get it. I know the cost of gasoline and groceries and rent seems to be harder and harder to handle that. But that's all the more reason why we have to pass the Build Back Better plan.</p>, <p>Seventeen Nobel laureates in the economy have spontaneously contacted us and told us and put out a national statement that my plan, they said, will ease inflationary pressures, not create them. And for those Americans who are focused on the cost of living, it's even more important to pass this legislation.</p>, <p>And there's so much more to do: voting rights, immigration, the courts, building on the Affordable Care Act, protecting women's right to choose, and so much more.</p>, <p>My message is this: We need to remember what got us to the White House in the first place. We won in 2020 because of you all, but also because we had at that time, at the end of the day, a unified party, more unified than ever.</p>, <p>Now, as we look to 2022, we have to stay united. We need to remember that the American people sent us here to deliver, to make their lives better, and when we do, to explain it to them.</p>, <p>I'm going to close with this: Not only Americans—are the American people watching, the world is watching. I met with the vast majority of the world leaders so far, in person mostly, but also on Zoom. I just returned from the G-20 and COP26 in Europe.</p>, <p>And the question the world is asking: Is America really back? They see the polarization. They see the attacks of January the 6th. And they're asking if American democracy can deliver. My answer is: Not only can we deliver, we have to deliver.</p>, <p>This is truly an inflection point in our Nation. Both Putin and Xi Jinping have indicated to me that they don't think democracies can work in the 21st century because it takes too long to arrive at a consensus; that's why autocracies are going to win the day.</p>, <p>But look, we're meeting some of the most important challenges head on we've ever faced. We're pulling out of a pandemic that has taken 750,000 lives and pulling our economy off its—you know, and we're pulling our economy back off its back. We're rebuilding the backbone of this nation, giving working people a fighting chance.</p>, <p>We can—confronting the existential threat of climate change. And we're defending and protecting the very democracy. And it's up to us: our country, our planet, our democracy. They're all in our hands. They're all in our hands.</p>, <p>If you continue to support me and the Democratic Party, I think we can do this, but it's not going to be easy. But I'm talking too long. I'm taking too much of your time. I want to hear what you've got on your mind.</p>, <p>But I want to thank you, and I really mean it, God bless you all for your help. It really matters.</p>]"

Biden,Remarks During a Virtual Grassroots Event and Question-and-Answer Session of the Democratic National Committee,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-during-virtual-grassroots-event-and-question-and-answer-session-the-democratic,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Hey, Jaime. Thank you, Mr. Chairman—Chairman Harrison. I tell you what: Your introduction was great, a little exaggerated, but thank you for your leadership<i>.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] And I want to special thanks to each of you, the grassroots advocates for—from all across the country. They tell me there's a whole bunch of you on this video.</p>, <p>Look, let me start with this: Kamala and I were sent here by the American people to deliver. And that's what we've done. After years of ""Infrastructure Week,"" followed by another—just a—we just passed a monumental piece of legislation.</p>, <p>It's going to create millions of jobs—and that's not just Joe Biden saying it; that's everyone from Wall Street to labor saying it—creating millions of jobs to grow our economy, make us more competitive, and take a giant step—and I mean this sincerely—a giant step toward dealing with climate and the climate crisis.</p>, <p>It's the most significant investment in passenger rail in the past 50 years, roads and bridges in the past 70 years, public transit ever. And we're going to modernize our ports, our airports, our freight rail and make it easier for companies to get their goods to market and reduce the supply chain bottlenecks—backlogs that are out there and lower the cost for working families.</p>, <p>It will replace lead pipes in every American—so that every American can drink clean water and not have to worry. Every American will have access to high-speed internet. And we'll see new fleets of electric vehicle, schoolbuses, a national network of charging stations—over 500,000 of them all across America—so we can charge up and drive across the country without ever having to do anything other than know you can get to the next charging station and make it all the way without worry at all.</p>, <p>We're going to also take away those diesel buses, which are where our children inhale diesel exhaust, making it safe and battery-operated buses.</p>, <p>We're making sure bridges you drive over are safe, making sure the water you drink is clean, to making sure that our power lines and our levees are strong enough to withstand the next hurricane, the next flood, the wildfire, or superstorm.</p>, <p>Look, this legislation is going to change the lives of every American. And for 4 years long—for 4 years long, the last President told us we're going to get the infrastructure done, but he couldn't get it done. So it was left to us, and we got the job done.</p>, <p>By the way, we got some help from some Republicans whom we had to encourage to vote for it initially and vote for it in the House. And now we need to do it again with my Build Back Better plan. And I'm confident we're going to get it done, as we did in the past with everything else we've tried so far. And we're going to need your help; your help and your talking about it makes a difference.</p>, <p>And for those families struggling to afford childcare and eldercare, our Build Back Better plan will be lifechanging. For those 2 million women who can't get back to the workforce right now because of things like childcare, this will get them back to work. And that's going to be good for them, good for their families, and good for the economy.</p>, <p>But there's more. There's universal pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old child in America. It's going to increase academic achievement in all children and give them an even start no matter what home they come from, no matter how little they've been taught to read or they've been read to. It's going to change everything.</p>, <p>More affordable health care and lower prescription drug costs. Tax cuts for working people and the middle class and are working their way into the middle class.</p>, <p>Together with the infrastructure bill, we're going to make the most significant investment ever to turn the climate crisis into an opportunity: new jobs. And all this is paid for by raising taxes on big corporations and the very wealthy. I'm not trying to punish anybody, but I'm insisting that they pay their fair share. It's fiscally responsible, and it's paid for.</p>, <p>Plus, one more thing: It extends the refundable child tax credit by putting the American Rescue Plan that we passed months ago. It's one of those things that I'm most proud of, because not only has this meant a tax cut for working families, not only has it helped some 60 million children in America. It has helped to cut child poverty in America by more than 40 percent. And that's something to really, really be proud of, in my view.</p>, <p>You know, we had some other big news just a few days ago: The COVID vaccine for children ages 5 to 12 was approved. That's going to give millions of Americans—millions of American parents peace of mind. And it means we now have all the tools to combat COVID-19. We have vaccine booster shots. Soon, an antiviral pill is going to prevent severe illness and death. And it's also—it's also been a long, tough fight, I know. We still have a way to go.</p>, <p>But we have every tool we need to get COVID-19 under control. And that's critically not only for the public health, but for our economy as well. I know you all know this.</p>, <p>Just last week, we reported over 500,000 jobs were created last month. In the 2 months earlier, it was raised by 250,000 jobs that had been underrated. And you know, it just—I think it was about 230—I think it might have—over 200,000 jobs.</p>, <p>But that means, over the course of my Presidency, with your help, we've created over 5 million new jobs just since we got sworn in on January the 20th. That's the biggest and largest number of jobs any President has ever created up to this point in their Presidency.</p>, <p>Now, I know that a lot of folks don't feel the progress we're making in the economy. I get it. I know the cost of gas, groceries, and rent seems to be harder and harder to handle. That's what—that's one of the most re—more reasons why we should have to pass my Build Back Better bill.</p>, <p>But if you'll hold for a second here. You know, when we passed the American—the first piece of legislation we passed, one of the reasons we did that—we knew people were in real trouble. So many people lost their jobs. So that's why you learned that we got everybody another $1,400 that would get them through. At the time, they got a check for $1,400.</p>, <p>It also made it easier for people to be able to—if you were—had a child, and we passed the child tax credit, it means if you had one child, you got to check for 300 bucks a month. If you had two—anyway, it goes on. So it really helped. But we had to do more.</p>, <p>You know, the Build Back Better plan is not going to cause inflation like people are talking about, because 17 Nobel laureates in economics have looked at my plans and said they will—it will ease inflationary pressure. So, for those Americans who are focused on the cost of living, it's even more important to pass this legislation.</p>, <p>Folks, I ran for President because, for too long, the working people of this Nation had been dealt out of the deal, and it was time to deal them back in. I ran to rebuild, as I said, the backbone of this Nation—working people, middle class folks—to rebuild the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.</p>, <p>That's why I wrote these bills in the first place. That's why it will matter so much when I sign them into law, because of you. And there's so much more to do: protecting the sacred right to vote, immigration, the courts, building on the Affordable Care Act, protecting a woman's right to choose, and so much more.</p>, <p>And my message is this: We need to remember what got us to the White House in the first place. We won in 2020 as a unified party, maybe more unified than ever. Now, as we look at 2022, we need to stay unified. We need to remember that the American people sent us here to deliver to make their lives better.</p>, <p>Let me close with this: This is no ordinary moment. This is truly an inflection point in the Nation's history. I truly believe that you and I are doing something—and some of the most important work ever—of meeting some of the most important challenges we've ever faced as a nation: We're putting out the pandemic—by pulling out of the pandemic that has—I hate to say it—lost 750,000 lives; pulling our economy back off the junk heap here and get us back on our feet; to rebuilding the backbone of this Nation, giving working people a fighting chance again; to confronting the existential crisis of climate change; to defending and protecting our very democracy and the right to vote.</p>, <p>There's no one else coming to do this work. It's up to us: our country, our planet, our democracy. They're all in our hands right now. So let's stay together.</p>, <p>This next phase is critically important. So let's stay engaged. Get involved. You already are if you're on this, but get involved and volunteer. Text ""Volunteer"" to 43367. Let me say it again: ""Volunteer"" to 43367.</p>, <p>We can do this. Let's believe in one another. As my grandfather would say, ""Let's keep the faith."" God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.</p>, <p>And I'm going to turn it back to Chairman Harrison. Jaime.</p>, <p><i>Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime R. Harrison.</i> Thank you, Mr. President. And let me just take personal privilege here, Mr. President, and thank you. This weekend, I was able to take my 7-year-old to get vaccinated. And I can't tell you how emotional it was for me and his mom just to have that level of confidence and protection for him. So thank you for all that you've done to make that possible.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you, Jaime.</p>, <p><i>Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Harrison.</i> Yes. We've got a few questions for you, Mr. President. The first one is: How will the bipartisan infrastructure bill help me and my family?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, look, the bipartisan infrastructure deal is going to have a significant impact on families across the country.</p>, <p>The infrastructure deal is going to create good-paying jobs, union jobs—not jobs paying $7 and $8, $9, $10—and not even $15. And the good part about this: None of these jobs can be outsourced. It's building here.</p>, <p>These jobs will do the following: one, put pipefitters and plumbers back to work replacing lead water pipes so every child in America can drink clean water. All those lead pipes will be gone. Transform rail, roads, and bridges—public transit—and modernize our ports and our airports and freight rail, increasing the ability for goods to flow more quickly across the country and around the world.</p>, <p>Manufacturing solar panels, wind farms, batteries, and electric vehicles to grow clean energy supply chains, so we can export to the world as well—not just benefit our country, but export to the world. Build out the first-ever national network of charging stations. As I said, over 550,000 so families can travel coast-to-coast in an electric vehicle.</p>, <p>Make high-speed internet affordable and available for every American household, rural and city, and make it affordable.</p>, <p>Clean up the brownfields and the Superfund sites, as well as plug abandoned mine lands—mines that are still open—orphaned wells. And stop polluting and protecting—and start to protect public health. And by the way, capping these wells are going to pay the same ways wage that digging the well cost—reward the workers. It's going to be a union wage.</p>, <p>Build up our resilience to superstorms and droughts and wildfires and hurricanes that cost billions of dollars a day. I mean, just this past year, these weather events have cost $99 billion in America—$99 billion. And these investments are going to help families with their commutes and school dropoffs with safer roads and better transit options.</p>, <p>And everyone—you know, everyone can tell me what the most dangerous intersection in their neighborhood is, can't you? We're going to fix it. That—the money is there for that. And that's true all across the country. And this bill is going to help fix intersections, like those dangerous ones you know in your town and your city.</p>, <p>And it's going to help businesses, small and large, compete, getting their good—their goods, and the goods they make, to market faster, and enable to offer lower prices.</p>, <p>How long have you heard people in Washington talk about passing an infrastructure bill? A long time. But we got it done. And by the way, 19 Republicans helped us pass it in the Senate, and Democrats voted for this bill. So it's not just talk, it's action.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Harrison.</i> Thank you, Mr. President. And I can tell you, particularly in rural communities, the broadband expansion is going to be big, and not only for jobs, but also for health care. A lot of our rural hospitals are closing because they are—they don't have access to broadband. So your help here is going to have a tremendous impact on many of those communities.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And, Jaime, let me point out that it's not only that, it's going to—as you said, at all those rural hospitals, this is going to allow telemedicine.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Harrison.</i> Exactly.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> It's going to make a big difference in people's lives. And how many people do you know, Jaime—whether it's in South Carolina or in Wilmington, Delaware, where I'm from, or wherever it is, and during this pandemic, where kids were out of school and they're being taught virtually—how many parents had to drive their kids to do their homework in a McDonald's parking lot because they could hook into their ability—they had internet that you could hook into?</p>, <p>But I mean, you know, this is just ridiculous in a country as great as ours.</p>, <p>I'm sorry to interrupt. Go ahead.</p>, <p><i>Education and Family Assistance Legislation </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Harrison.</i> No, no. I agree, Mr. President. We also got a question from an educator, and she said: ""As an educator, I've been keeping an eye on the parts of the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the Build Back Better Act that would help our children. Can you explain how these bills would work together to help the next generations of students succeed in their education?""</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, first of all, I'm married to an educator. I think my wife Jill—or I'm Jill's husband, as we say in my house—she teaches fulltime in a community college and has taught for years in the public school system. And then, since I became Vice President, we moved to—before that, she worked as a community college professor in Delaware, and now she works as a community college professor in Northern Virginia and still does her duties as First Lady.</p>, <p>And she has an expression. She says, ""Any country that outeducates us is going to outcompete us."" The average cost of pre-K in the United States is $8,600. That's a tough squeeze for working families. Under my plan—and this now going to go into effect—under my plan, we're going to be able to provide free preschool for every 3- and 4-year-old in America when this next bill passes.</p>, <p>And the studies have shown that kids who go to pre-K are more likely to stay in school and do better over the course of their education, no matter what the background they come from. Some people come—kids come from backgrounds where, as you know, as a teacher—all the studies show where if you're from a middle class family or an upper middle class family, and there's books and parents read to you, and et cetera, et cetera, you start off having heard a million more words than a kid coming from a poor household or a household with a single parent that didn't have the time to do that.</p>, <p>This is one of the best investments we're going to make because it equalizes the playing field. The 3-year-old from the house that has been—had economic pressure on it and the 3-year-old from the house that doesn't, they end up being able to do the same thing throughout school.</p>, <p>Look—and we're going to make sure that education beyond high school is more accessible for those families who—[<i>inaudible</i>]—by raising the maximum in what they call Pell grants. And we've increased the amount of Pell grants, and we've invested in community college and workforce programs that will be able to be used for parents who can't afford it.</p>, <p>So it makes a big change in educational opportunity, plus so many other things I believe it does indirectly for kids, in terms of their overall education.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Harrison.</i> Well, Mr. President, again, I'm married to a former—I'm married to a teacher, and I was a former teacher myself. And I can tell you this is a big deal for many, many working families, and it's going to be a big deal for our kids.</p>, <p>And we just want to thank you for everything that you have done to make this possible.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Jaime, you know, the interesting thing is, what really got me focused on preschool and making sure it was available is, you know, of all the countries in the world, we rank number 33—I think it was—out of 44 of the leading countries, according to the OECD, of leading—the most advanced countries in the world—the United States—in early education. We rank at the bottom of the list—the United States of America. And it's long overdue.</p>, <p>And it also shows—all the studies that the great universities have done in the last 10 years demonstrate that if they have—if they go to preschool at 3 and 4 years old, it increases by something like 53 percent the ability of—the likelihood that that child will go all the way through all 12 years and go beyond high school.</p>, <p>So it's like you would say or your wife or my wife: Any country that outeducates us is going to outcompete us.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Harrison.</i> Well, and, Mr. President, I think people should also understand that this isn't your first time investing in education. The American Rescue Plan got our schools back open. And that is something that you did, along with all the Democrats in the House and the Senate. And sad to say, not one Republican in either body actually voted for that plan. But it was you who helped to get our schools back open.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I'm hoping, Jaime, that we can get back to a place where there's more civility in politics. I really mean it. And I've never seen it this way.</p>, <p>You know, the Republicans who voted in the House of Representatives for the infrastructure bill—you've seen in the press the reports that the other Republicans are trying to strip them of their standing in their Congress. If they're a chairman of a committee, they're trying to strip them of that chairmanship. I've never seen it like this before. It's got to stop for the sake of America.</p>, <p>I know I get in trouble when I talk about ""bipartisan,"" because people say, ""Why the devil would I like any Republicans?"" Well, it's important. We are—unless we get—generate consensus in America, we're in trouble.</p>, <p>And the one thing we generated consensus on and then the very people who voted for it initially—because it looked like the Democrats were going to be given credit for something—are now being threatened with their chairmanships. It's just not right. We're going to change it though.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Harrison.</i> Well, thank you, for—Mr. President, for—from all of us. We really appreciate your visit, your leadership, and your heart. And you're the President we need at this moment. So, thank you again, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, but what we need at this moment are the thousands of people you have on this Zoom here. And listen, I want to thank them all. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. It's who we are. Thanks.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Harrison.</i> Well, thank you again for joining us this afternoon, Mr. President. And we look forward to seeing you all again—seeing you again soon.</p>]"

3,6,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Honoring the 2021 National Basketball Association Champion Milwaukee Bucks,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-honoring-the-2021-national-basketball-association-champion-milwaukee-bucks,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Well, good afternoon, everyone.</p>, <p><i>Forward Giannis Antetokounmpo.</i> Good afternoon. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>It's an honor. It's an honor to host the 2021 NBA championship—the champions, the Milwaukee Bucks. I—congratulations to team owners Marc and Wes and Jamie and Mike.</p>, <p>And to two dear, dear friends, Ted and Mary Kellner: You won't believe it, but they're both responsible for my being here. Not a joke.</p>, <p>In nineteen—excuse the point of personal privilege, as we used to say in the Senate. In 1972, I was a 29-year-old kid who decided I was going to run the United States Senate. I wasn't old enough. You had to be 30 to be a Senator, for real. When I got elected, I had to wait 17 days to be eligible. And right at the very end, my sister managed my campaign, and my brother raised the money. He was 25, and my sister was—she used to be 3 years younger; she's now 20 years younger. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But at any rate, and we were doing well. We were catching up. No one expected us to have any shot at all. And we—everything was moving. We were actually catching up after being down 56 to 28 at one point. And we were running out of money. And all of a sudden, I got a phone call on Tuesday saying that we don't have any money to keep any of our ads on TV or the radio.</p>, <p>And so I didn't know what to do. And I got a call from a guy named Ted Kellner and four other people. And they said: ""Come on out to Greenville. We want to help you out."" They helped me out; they financed the end of my campaign. They were my friends before, and I'm indebted to them now. Well, thank you both, Ted and Mary. Thank you. Now that I've ruined your reputation. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And while he couldn't be here today, I also want to congratulate the team's previous owner and a dear friend of mine—served in the United States Senate—Herb Kohl, one of the finest guys I served with, a man of significant honor.</p>, <p>And, folks, congratulations to the staff and to the fans and everyone here to celebrate, including the Second Gentleman. Doug—where are you, Doug? There's a man—he's a basketball fan. [<i>Laughter</i>] He's the Second Gentleman. He's a first-rate lawyer, and now he's the Second Gentleman. And I don't know where he has more power. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Most of all, congratulations to all the players. Now, I know you've got final—you know, you got in the Finals—the MVP player here. And I'd like to talk about it for just a minute.</p>, <p>You know, we—we also got someone who earned the award that's just as important in my book. Donte, I'm honored to be with him tonight—today, because, in 2015, he was the Delaware high school boys basketball Player of the Year. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Donte grew up in Newark, Delaware, attended a high school—I still like him anyway. There's two competing high schools—Catholic high schools in Delaware: Archmere and Salesianum. Salesianum had five times as many boys, but—and they beat us all the time. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I still—I still was the second highest scorer at football. But at any rate—you know, I don't know, man. Donte, I still like you in spite of that fact.</p>, <p>And so—and he won two State championships there. So he's used to this championship stuff. But then he starred at Villanova. And the Bidens are a sporting family, particularly my wife Jill, who's, as she calls herself, ""a Philly girl."" She takes it up a notch. She knows a lot about the sport, and she never forgives anybody if they lose. But you know, we went to the University of Delaware, Jill and I, years apart. And then she went on to Villanova grad school, and I went to Syracuse Law School.</p>, <p>In 2016, we went to the Final Four to watch our teams play. And I watched—I watched Donte win his first of his two national titles at 'Nova. Donte, we're also proud of you back home, but I still like Syracuse. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And, to all the players, that's what you represent for so many people: pride—pride and decency. Just look at the enduring images during the Finals. Thousands of fans celebrating in the Deer District of—and the Herb Kohl Way. You know, you represented yourselves and your families, your organizations, and a great American city by staying true to who you are. You did the work off—in the offseason and during the grueling regular season.</p>, <p>In the playoffs, down 0-2 against Brooklyn, and then to make it—just to keep your—the owners and your coach in constant perspiring, you—[<i>laughter</i>]—you, in the Finals, you were down 0-2 against Phoenix. But you never gave up. I watched. It was amazing how you came back. You always believed. And, Coach Bud, you got them to play as a team.</p>, <p>You know, Giannis, 50 points—50 points—to seal game 6 to win the Bucks' first championship in 50 years, since Kareem—[<i>laughter</i>]—Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson won it for the Bucks. And the worst part is, I remember them both. [<i>Laughter</i>] I was a kid. I was a kid. You know? I remember them both. Finals MVP, two-time NBA MVP, five-time All-Star, and just named one of the—to the list of the 75 greatest NBA players ever.</p>, <p>I might add that I'm proud that two Syracuse guys made it—Carmelo Anthony, as well as Dave Bing. I actually was at graduate school when they were playing, and—who played around this time—the time I was there.</p>, <p>And at just—and at just 26 years old, you've—you're just getting started. What makes it even more special is, you won the title with your brother, who is here today. And you join another brother already with a ring. What a hell of a family. I'll tell you what, man. [<i>Laughter</i>] I think you won the gene pool. [<i>Laughter</i>] And you've still got two more, right?</p>, <p>Sons living the dream of an immigrant family from Nigeria and then Greece in search of new opportunity. In struggles, they always dreamed. Brothers who once had to share the same basketball shoes, all five of them, before they got to the NBA. I tell you what, I would have liked to have been there when you—that fight went on—who got the shoes when. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Mr. Antetokounmpo</i>. Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>But, at any rate, I know—I know your mom is so proud of you and is watching. And your dad is watching—looking down, watching over you all. And your baby boys, who will grow up knowing that anything is possible. And that's the power of the team's example.</p>, <p>And not just winning the title. Last year, as a team, you took a stand for justice and peace in the wake of Jacob Blake's shooting in Kenosha, Wisconsin. And you've gotten—and you've gotten people engaged—[<i>applause</i>]. No, it really mattered, because I remember calling your coach. You got people engaged in the vote, in the political process. You've encouraged fans to get vaccinated.</p>, <p>You know, you—I just want to thank you. I want to thank Jrue Holiday and his wife Lauren, who, by the way, is probably a better athlete. [<i>Laughter</i>] You're good. You're good, but I tell you what, you—[<i>laughter</i>]—you married way up, pal. [<i>Laughter</i>] Jill and I watched her. I—seriously, we watched her bring home a Women's World Cup in place in 2015 to add to her two other Olympic Gold Medals. I mean, what the hell, you know? [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And they are world-class athletes. And they talked about why getting vaccinated is so important and—to protect yourself and those you love and the people around you. And it mattered. So I want to thank you both.</p>, <p>And I'll conclude with this: This year marks the 75th anniversary of the NBA. During that time, we've seen generations of players define their eras with their styles and the play and their personalities. And we've seen a distinctly American game become the fastest growing sport in the world—the fastest growing sport in the world.</p>, <p>When I first went to Beijing to meet with Xi Jinping, he put me out on a basketball court. I'm not like these guys. I can play a little bit. But he put me on a basketball court. And I'm thinking to myself, ""Everywhere in the world I go, as I travel the world—basketball."" And the best players want to come to America, though, in search of possibilities.</p>, <p>And through it all, one thing remains constant: the values of the game and of the sport: team work, hard work, respect, and the belief that we can strengthen the bonds that bring us together and stand up for something bigger than ourselves.</p>, <p>The first time an NBA Championship team visited the White House was in January 1963, when President Kennedy hosted the Boston Celtics. A few months later in August, Bill Russell returned to Washington, this time to stand on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to hear Dr. King and his speech on—""I Have a Dream"" in front of the whole Nation.</p>, <p>Today I am honored to welcome the Milwaukee Bucks to continue that tradition. A sport—and in sport and in a democracy, unity, perhaps, is the most elusive thing and the most necessary thing. But that's who this team is. They're unified. That's who we are as a nation.</p>, <p>As we saw over the weekend, with the getting closer to the passing consequential investments in our Nation and our people, there's nothing stopping us when we work together—nothing. And that—as one team, as one Nation, there's not a thing we've ever failed to do. Never, ever, ever when the American people have been given half a chance, they've ever let their country down.</p>, <p>And just like you. You've worked together, and watching you has just been incredible. So congratulations to the Milwaukee Bucks. The best of luck for the rest of this season. [<i>Laughter</i>] Actually, this is a season that is just beginning for us here.</p>, <p>But all kidding aside, best of luck next year. But you all are the best. You're the best, and it's a great honor to have you here.</p>, <p>Now, I think I'm supposed to introduce somebody, but I'm not sure who am I supposed to introduce now. [<i>Laughter</i>] Come on. I'm joking. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Co-owner Marc Lasry.</i> I know. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>I get you guys confused, you know. [<i>Laughter</i>]<i> </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Lasry.</i> Thank you, Mr. President. I also want to thank the Vice President, who we were able to meet earlier today with our family. I want to—I never know—do I say, ""Thank you, Doug""? Do I say, ""Thank you, Second Gentleman?"" But either way, it's been a real pleasure, and I want to thank you for being here.</p>, <p>We want to thank everybody here. It's been a real honor for us—I mean, obviously, as a team and for everything that we stand for and everything that we've done. But you know, it's actually really cool to win a championship. You get to come to the White House.</p>, <p>And you know, I think, for us, the one thing we'd like is, hopefully, we'll come back here next year, sir—[<i>laughter</i>]—and we'll do it again.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Antetokounmpo</i>. No pressure. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lasry</i>. You know, what the hell? Why don't we come back for the next 4 years? We'll just keep coming back. You know what? Let's do it for 8 years, and then we'll do it here.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I think that's a good idea. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lasry.</i> It is, isn't it? So, one, we want to say thank you. I'm going to introduce Giannis, who really needs no introduction. As the President said, he led our team to the championship. So, without further ado, Giannis.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Antetokounmpo.</i> This is awesome. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Marc.</p>, <p>On behalf of my teammates, the coach staff, the Bucks organization, we are very grateful for this opportunity. You know, a kid from Sepolia, Athens, Greece, grew up from two Nigerian parents. They were struggling every day to provide for us, illegal in a country that they didn't call home at the time.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, Mr. Antetokounmpo continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>And, man, as I said, I've done that my whole life, and I'm in the White House. This is awesome. [<i>Laughter</i>] You can never take moments like that for granted. But without hard work, that will not be possible. Thank you, guys.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, thank you all sitting out there in the sun. And everybody out in that audience has been a great supporter of this outfit. And it's been a great honor, a great pleasure to get to meet some of the players, get to know them a little bit.</p>, <p>And so I'll be not disappointed if I'm welcoming you back here next year, except that if the Sixers hear about that, I'm going to not be allowed in Philadelphia again.

3,7,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on House of Representatives Passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-house-representatives-passage-the-infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-and,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good morning, folks.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Good morning.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Good morning.</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>Well, finally: Infrastructure Week. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm so happy to say that: Infrastructure Week. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Folks, yesterday—I don't think it's an exaggeration to suggest that we took a monumental step forward as a nation. We learned that our economy created 5.6 million jobs since we took office on January 20, reached an unemployment rate of 4.6 percent, 2 full years earlier than the vast majority of economists projected that would happen. And we've just—we're just getting started.</p>, <p>We did something that's long overdue, that long has been talked about in Washington, but never actually been done. The House of Representatives passed an Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. That's a fancy way of saying a bipartisan infrastructure bill, a once-in-a-generation investment that's going to create millions of jobs modernizing our infrastructure—our roads, our bridges, our broadband, a whole range of things—to turn the climate crisis into an opportunity. And it puts us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st century that we face with China and other large countries and the rest of the world.</p>, <p>It's going to create more jobs—good-paying jobs, union jobs that can't be outsourced—and they're going to transform our transportation system with the most significant investments in passenger rail—the most significant investment in 50 years; in roads and bridges—the most significant investment in 70 years; and more investment in public transit than we've ever, ever made. Period.</p>, <p>It's going to modernize our ports and our airports—and I'm going to be going to some of our ports next week—and to freight rail, increasing that as a—I mean, look, we have a—we have bottlenecks across the country. We're doing so much with this legislation. It's going to make it easier for companies to get goods to market more quickly and reduce supply chains' bottlenecks and now—and now and for decades to come.</p>, <p>You know, and according to the economists, this is going to be—ease inflationary pressure—not increase it, ease inflationary pressures by lowering costs for working families.</p>, <p>It's going to create jobs replacing lead and—lead water pipes so every American, every child can drink clean water, improving their health and putting plumbers and pipefitters to work. How long have we been talking about that? It's a gigantic issue.</p>, <p>Jobs making high-speed internet affordable and available everywhere in America. And you heard me say this before—and I apologize for repeating myself—but no parent should have to sit in a parking lot of a fast food restaurant so their child can do their homework because they have no internet connection except to go off of what's going on at—with that internet connect from the fast food restaurant.</p>, <p>It's going to make significant, historic strides to take on the climate crisis. Some of you were with me when I was recently in Scotland at the COP26. What did people keep asking me? ""Are you going to fund this? Are you going to fund it? Are you really going to do what you're saying? Are you""—well, this will go steps—get to along—a big step along the way of doing it.</p>, <p>We're going to build out the first-ever national network of charging stations all across the country—over 500,000 of them—so that you can make real—and you know, auto companies made a commitment they were going to make 50 percent of vehicles electric by 2030. So you'll be able to go across the whole darn country, from East Coast to West Coast, just like you'd stop at a gas station now. These charging stations will be available.</p>, <p>It will get America off the sidelines on manufacturing: manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, battery storage, energy and power for electric vehicles from schoolbuses to automobiles.</p>, <p>And it will reward companies for paying good wages and for getting materials for their products from right from here in America and America exporting and providing the rest of the world with these technologies that are generated here in the United States as we go green around the world.</p>, <p>It also makes historic investments in environmental cleanup and remediation. It builds up our resilience against superstorms and droughts and wildfires, hurricanes. You know, you've heard me say it—again, I apologize for repeating myself—but $99 billion in losses last year because of climate crises. In America—$99 billion it costs the taxpayers of America. It represents a blinking red code out there for our Nation.</p>, <p>Vice President Harris and I look forward to having a formal signing ceremony for this bipartisan infrastructure soon. Because—but everybody is not—I'm not doing it this weekend because I want people who worked so hard to get this done—Democrats and Republicans—to be here when we sign it.</p>, <p>But we're looking more forward to having shovels in the ground to begin rebuilding America. And for all of you at home who feel left behind and forgotten in an economy that's changing so rapidly, this bill is for you. The vast majority of the thousands of jobs that will be created don't require a college degree. They'll be jobs in every part of the country: red States, blue States, cities, small towns, rural communities, Tribal communities. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America. And it's long overdue.</p>, <p>I'm also proud that the House took a big step toward—forward to pass my Build Better—my Build Back Better Act, which for the week of November 15, they're going to be taking up. They went through the procedural mechanisms to assure that occurs. Let me be clear: We will pass this in the House, and we'll pass it in the Senate.</p>, <p>The Build Back Better Act will be a once-in-a-generation investment in our people, getting America back to work by reducing the costs of childcare and eldercare and getting millions of women back on the job who have to stay home because they cannot afford the childcare or the health care for their parents; providing universal pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old child in America and increasing their academic achievement potential significantly—significantly; making health care more affordable; lowering prescription drugs costs; and tax cuts for working people and the middle class so that folks have just a little—as my—I know you're tired of hearing me saying—my dad used to always say, as a middle class guy, ""We just need a little breathing room""—a little breathing room.</p>, <p>It's going to reduce child poverty in this country, by the way, by 50 percent. We're already on track to do that with the child tax credit we passed in our last piece of legislation.</p>, <p>And this bill is fiscally responsible. That's a fancy way of saying it's fully paid for. It doesn't raise the deficit by a single penny. And it actually reduces the deficit, according to leading economists in this country, over the long-term. And it's paid for by making sure that the wealthiest Americans, the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share.</p>, <p>Again, you've heard me say it a hundred times: Why should 40—or 55 corporations who made over $40 billion in the last couple years—why should they pay zero in taxes? I said I'm a capitalist, I'm not a socialist. But the bottom line is, everybody should pay their fair share. Zero in taxes? Come on.</p>, <p>And so—and keep my campaign commitment: It does not raise a single penny in tax for anyone making less than $400,000 a year. Say it again: Folks, no matter what they tell you, you're going to find out this will not affect your taxes one little bit in having to pay a penny more if you make less than $400,000 a year.</p>, <p>Independent experts have concluded that these bills are the highest value investments that we can make to grow the economy. It's going to create millions of jobs, increase productivity and wages and reduce costs, and generate significant and historic economic growth.</p>, <p>Again, the press is here—the poor people who have to follow me all the time—they've heard me say this a lot: We got, out of the blue, a couple week ago, a letter from 17 Nobel Prize winners in economics. And they determined that it will ease inflationary pressures—not create them, ease them—ease those pressures.</p>, <p>And for the economy, it recognizes that we face an inflection point. For most of the 20th century, we led the world by a significant margin because we invested in our people. We invested in ourselves.</p>, <p>You've heard me say it a thousand times: Jill would say—my wife says, ""Any country that outeducates us is going to outcompete us."" We invested in education. We invested in health. We invested in things that affect people's opportunities to succeed.</p>, <p>We built an Interstate Highway System, which led to the best roads, bridges, airports, and transit systems in the world. These are the arteries of commerce that have moved goods from coast to coast quickly; that's why people decide to build facilities here in the United States. We empowered our companies to outcompete the world. And we created jobs and untold opportunities for our people to travel, to live, and to work.</p>, <p>But somewhere along the way, we stopped investing in ourselves. We stopped investing in our people. And we've risked losing our edge as a nation. I don't even think it was conscious, but that's just what's happened. And China and the rest of the world are moving to catch up and, in some cases, in certain areas, move ahead.</p>, <p>Our infrastructure used to be rated the best in the world. Today—today—according to the World Economic Forum, we rank 13th in the world. The United States of America ranks 13th in the world in infrastructure. Come on.</p>, <p>We used to lead the world in educational achievement. Now the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development—the OECD—ranks America 35th out of 37 major companies when it comes to investing in early education for childhood education and care. Think about that.</p>, <p>Those of you who are parents know: You start kids early. You give them the basics. You give them the material to be able to go on. It's simply unacceptable that we rank 35.</p>, <p>We're now turning it around in a big way. Any single element of this plan would be a fundamental change in America, but taken together, they're truly consequential.</p>, <p>Again, I have—I'll have more to say this—about this soon. But when we have the bill signing, I'll be able to thank everyone in the Senate and the House for their leadership. I hesitate to start now; I'll leave somebody out, and I want to make sure everyone who was a part of this gets credit for it.</p>, <p>But, for now, I want to quickly thank Members of the House who worked so hard to get some of this done: Speaker Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, Jim Clyburn, progressive leaders, moderate leaders, Democrats, Republicans—they, in fact, worked together.</p>, <p>It was like—as I saw—someone told me on my staff this morning that—on one of the programs this morning they said, ""Well, we finally—the sausage is made."" [<i>Laughter</i>] You know—well, you know, it is a process. You all know it. You're all pros. You cover it.</p>, <p>The American people have made clear one overwhelming thing, I think—and I really mean it—all the talk about the elections and what do they mean and everything: They want us to deliver. They want us to deliver. Democrats, they want us to deliver. Last night we proved we can. On one big item, we delivered.</p>, <p>I want to close with this: For much too long, working people in the middle class of this country have been dealt out of the promise of America. That sounds like hyperbole, but I really mean it.</p>, <p>Some of you may remember, when I ran, I was legitimately—I mean, it's appropriate to be criticized. I don't mean—I'm not complaining about being criticized. But when I said I was running for three reasons: one, to restore the soul of America, bring back some decency and honor in the way in which we dealt with one another.</p>, <p>The second reason was to rebuild the backbone of the country: the middle class. The wealthy are value added to the country, but they didn't build the country. Hard-working middle class folks are the ones that built this country. They're the ones that built—the middle class—they're the ones that built the backbone of the country.</p>, <p>And what I decided to do was, I said we have to begin to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out. Well, folks, that hadn't been the case. I'm so tired about trickle-down economic theory that I'm trickled out.</p>, <p>The idea that—and I asked the rhetorical question: When the middle class has done well, when have the wealthy have—never have—when during any time have the wealthy not done extremely well as well? I mean, come on. We've got to give working folks a real chance—a chance.</p>, <p>And so, folks, there's an awful lot more to say about this. But today I think, is a—it's just been a good day. You know, it's time to deal folks back in.</p>, <p>You know, as you've heard me say it again—I make no apologies for it: These bills—these bills, in fact, are—the two bills we're talking about—Build Back and—the Build Back Better bill, which we're going to be working on now, and this bill, are all designed to give ordinary people a fighting chance to begin to sort of level the playing field just a little bit, not punish anybody.</p>, <p>I've long said it's never ever been a good bet to bet against the American people. Never. And that—what it really means is: Bet on the American people. Give them a shot. Give them a shot. That's what these plans do. They bet on average Americans. They believe in America. They believe in the limitless capacity of the American people.</p>, <p>If you look at the history of the journey of this Nation, what becomes crystal clear—not a joke: Given half a chance, the American people have never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever let their country down. We're about giving them a full chance this time. And when we do, there's going to be no stopping us.</p>, <p>I truly believe that 50 years from now, folks are going to look back and say, ""This was the moment, this was the period, this year and the next couple years, when America decided to win the competition of the 21st century, to get in the game full bore.""</p>, <p>So my message to all the American folks is: Let's get to work. Let's get this done.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.</p>, <p>And I'll take a few questions.</p>, <p><i>Off-Year Gubernatorial and Congressional Elections/The President's Legislative Agenda </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, to what extent did the election results help propel this bill to the finish line? And how did—how were you able to bridge the gap last night between moderates and progressives?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, you know, I'm not being facetious with the answer I'm about to give you, but I don't—I'm not going to be a prognosticator and make a judgment on what—how the election could or would have been different. Each State is different. And I don't know.</p>, <p>But I think the one message that came across was: Get something done. It's time to get something done. Stop yelling—stop talking. Get something done.</p>, <p>And so, I think, again, that's what the American people are looking for. And I think it's a legitimate—and when you ask how we were able to bring things together—[<i>laughter</i>]—well, you know. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President made the sign of the cross</i>.]</p>, <p>Look, all kidding aside, I have—I believe everybody in the process is entitled to be treated with respect. And I've been doing this kind of thing my—doesn't mean—it's not all me, but I've been doing this thing my whole life. I've been able, in the Senate, to put things together when people said they couldn't be put together just by making the overwhelming point that you can't have all you want. It's a process. There's no one piece of legislation that's going to solve everybody's problems.</p>, <p>So I spent a lot of time, as you probably heard, with a lot of people—both political parties and within my party—saying: ""Look, let's—if we move on what's here in this bill—that is, the infrastructure bill—it is a game changer in a half a dozen ways. The fact that it has too much of what you don't want or more than you—and not enough where you don't want—just—let's be reasonable. Let's take a look at this. Let's do what we all agree, at a minimum, is in the interests of the American people. And if you want to add more, we can fight about it later, or you want to subtract some of it.""</p>, <p>I have never voted for a major piece of legislation—an omnibus bill—that I was for every piece of it. People say, ""Well, how do I explain this?"" I said, ""Well, you explain to the American—your constituency—and I'm not telling you how to do it. But you go home and say, 'This is what it did. It had one piece in here. There's not enough money for this, or there's too much money for that. But, overall, this has been a gigantic benefit to my congressional district.""</p>, <p>And so I spent a lot of time taking questions from both. And by the way, everybody, at the end of the day—I have to admit—dealt with me fairly. I mean, they were—we—and part of the process—and this is probably more than you need to know—but part of the process is getting to know all of the people personally again. I've been out of government for 4 years. I used to do this every day. I used to know about everybody's district I was working with when I was Vice President. I'd know—I know them and call up and say, ""Hey, Charlie or Harry or Mary"" or—right?</p>, <p>And so it's getting to know a lot of these people, to build trust. Because everything I say I'm going to try to do, I will try to do. And I think that's also part of the process. And so I—hopefully it can continue.</p>, <p><i>Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries/Education and Family Assistance Legislation </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President—you just alluded to it there, Mr. President. Two questions. You are arguably the most legislatively experienced President we have ever seen. But to get this first agenda item over the finish line, you needed Republican votes.</p>, <p><i>The President</i>. Sure.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>You are not going to have Republican votes, though, for your Build Back Better Agenda. Isn't it doomed?</p>, <p>And then my second question, Mr. President. OPEC Plus has snubbed your call to pump more oil. When will you respond with an SPR release?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, first of all, I'm not anticipating that OPEC would respond, that Russia and/or Saudi Arabia would respond. They're going to pump some more oil; whether they pump enough oil is a different thing.</p>, <p>There are other—are—there other tools in the arsenal that we have to deal—and I'm dealing with other countries; at an appropriate time, I will talk about it—that we can get more energy in the—in the pipeline, figuratively and literally speaking.</p>, <p>And I don't start off with any assumption that I can't get anybody to vote for anything. And so I don't—I mean that sincerely.</p>, <p>I think what's going to happen is, we're going to see what happens in the Senate, and whether or not I need only Democratic votes, which is likely—which is the likely outcome. And the question is: Can I get all of those votes? This is a process.</p>, <p>And all along, you told me I can't do any of it anyway. From the very beginning. No, no, come on, be honest. Okay? You didn't believe we could do any of it. And I don't blame you. Because you look at the facts, you wonder, ""How is this going to get done?""</p>, <p>But I think there's a—I think there's a dawning on the part of a lot of people—a whole elective office that if you get some of this done, things are better for them as well as everybody else.</p>, <p>And I'm sure there's some calculations saying, ""Well, if Biden gets this other bill, then he's going to be moving too fast and it's going to hurt—you know, the Democrats are going to be doing too well."" That's why I think we have to try to figure out how to make the case across the board, as to—there's a lot of things we have to tackle yet. So——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Education and Family Assistance Legislation </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, have you gotten assurances from moderate Democrats in the House and Senate that they are going to vote for your Build Back Better plan now that what they really wanted—the infrastructure bill—has passed?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> You know I'm not going to answer that question for you, because I'm not going to get into who—what made what commitments to me. I don't negotiate in public.</p>, <p>But I feel confident—I feel confident that we will have enough votes to pass the Build Back Better plan.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>What gives you that confidence? What gives you that confidence?</p>, <p><i>The President</i>. Me. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Q</i>. President Biden——</p>, <p><i>Paid Family Leave </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, you were forced to scrub paid family leave from your framework a couple of weeks ago——</p>, <p><i>The President</i>. I'm sorry?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>You were forced to pull paid family leave from the framework you released a couple of weeks ago. The House is putting it back in. Can you keep it in this bill when it makes its way to the Senate?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Time will tell.</p>, <p><i>Migrant Family Separation Policy </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, I'd like to ask you, real quick, sir: Where do you stand? You said last week that this report about migrant families at the border getting payments was ""garbage.""</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I didn't say that.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>You said——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Let's get it straight. You said everybody coming across the border gets $500- —$450,000.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>So the number was what you had a problem with.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> The number is what I was referring to.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Okay.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Now, here's the thing——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Sure.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> If in fact, because of the outrageous behavior of the last administration, you coming across the border, whether it was legal or illegal, and you lost your child—you lost your child—it's gone—you deserve some kind of compensation, no matter what the circumstance.</p>, <p>What that will be, I have no idea. I have no idea.</p>, <p>Yes?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>You're okay with DOJ negotiating a settlement?</p>, <p><i>Iran/China </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, two questions. You referred to China twice in your comments, and yet we haven't heard anything about the China bill, which is really the third element of what you're hoping to do here.</p>, <p>It's been through the Senate but has not yet come up to the House. And it would seem that that is the one that is more key to our competitiveness. So I was wondering if you would talk a little bit about that.</p>, <p>And then also tell us how you're feeling right now about the Iran deal, since it looks like you're going to go back to discussion at the end of the month.</p>, <p>But the Iranians have made it pretty clear at this point: They don't—they plan to rip up most of what was done so far. So are you into your plan B at this point?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm not going to comment on Iran now.</p>, <p>And the China bill you're referring to—everything in good time. We've got to get this through. We've got to get this through. The next thing is Build Back Better.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>So when do you plan to do that?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, in order.</p>, <p>I'm going to take one more question, and then——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President—can I follow up on paid leave, Mr. President? Sir, may I follow up on paid leave?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>President Biden—[<i>laughter</i>].</p>, <p>[<i>Two reporters began asking questions at once. The President covered his eyes and pointed toward the press</i>. <i>A reporter then asked a question as follows</i>.]</p>, <p><i>The President's Campaign Promises/National Economy/Coronavirus Pandemic/Global Supply Chain Disruptions </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>[<i>Laughter</i>] Mr. President, Democratic Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger said of your Presidency this week: ""Nobody elected him to be FDR. They elected him to be normal and stop the chaos."" How do you view your mandate after Tuesday's election losses for Democrats? And is she wrong?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, she—Abigail is a friend. We had a long talk. She joked and said that I have a picture—she said I have a picture of Roosevelt hanging in my office—her office, okay?</p>, <p>I don't intend to anybody but Joe Biden. That's who I am. And what I'm trying to do is do the things that I ran on to do. And look, people out there are—ordinary, hard-working Americans are really, really—been put through the wringer the last couple years, starting with COVID.</p>, <p>COVID has disrupted almost every family one way or another, whether it's wearing a mask or losing a family member. You know, we have 750,000-plus Americans dead—750,000.</p>, <p>And so people are worried. People are also worried about, you know, coming up—they don't—understandably. ""Why is the price of agricultural products—and when I go to the store, why is it higher?""</p>, <p>What—like, for example, if I had—if we were all going out and having lunch together and I said, ""Let's ask whoever the—whoever is at the next table, no matter how—what restaurant we're in—have them explain the supply chain to us."" You think they'd understand what we're talking about?</p>, <p>They're smart people. But supply chain—""Well, why is everything backed up?"" Well, it's backed up because the people who supply the materials that end up being on our kitchen table or in our family—our life—guess what? They're closing those plants because they have COVID. They're not—and so it's a complicated world that people are facing. We've never faced anything like this before. I mean, I'm not saying it's the worst of every time in American history, but we never faced anything this, sort of, defiant of understanding of what's going on.</p>, <p>And you can understand why people are upset. And I—whether you have a Ph.D. or you're working, you know, in a restaurant, it's confusing. And so people are understandably worried. They're worried.</p>, <p>And so all I can say is: What I'm going to try to do is explain to the American people, as best I can—and by the way, you all write for a living. I haven't seen any one of you explain the supply chain very well. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, no, I'm not being critical. I'm being deadly earnest. When your editor says, ""Explain the supply chain."" Okay? ""Lots of luck in your senior year,"" as my coach used to say. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But I sincerely mean it. This is a confusing time—a confusing time. Think of all those children—all those children who may have lost more than a year of education by only being out one semester.</p>, <p>Think of all that's going on, in terms of access to everything from—when you go back to college, if you're in college—you go back to college—wear—you have to wear your mask or who's your roommate. What—I mean, this is a confusing moment.</p>, <p>And it seems to me that my job as the President of the United States is to try to figure out—myself, as well—what is most needed to put people at ease and let them know there's a way through this. There's a way through this.</p>, <p>The world has never been here before. That sounds like hyperbole, but think about it. Think about it. This truly is one of those inflection points in history. All the pieces on the board are moving, both in terms of the relationships among and between nations, as well as the pieces about what employment future people have. How do we do this?</p>, <p>And so this is a confusing time. But I promise—I promise—the American people: I have one focus: ""How do we give you some breathing room? How do we get you to the point where we take pressure off you so you can begin to get back to a degree of normality and we move to a different place?""</p>, <p>And this time when we move—and by the way, everybody internationally uses ""Build Back Better"" now. When I used the phrase initially, people looked at me like, ""Build Back Better?""</p>, <p>But what it means—we're the only country in the world, gone through a crisis, to go through a crisis, and come out better than we were before the crisis occurred. That's building back better than it was before.</p>, <p>And so this is a process. And I just—you know, we're going to see. Take it every day, every moment at a—you know, one moment at a time.</p>, <p>I could take—I'm going to get in real trouble. [<i>Laughter</i>] This is the last question I'm taking. You can decide who I'm pointing to. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>[<i>The President closed his eyes and pointed toward the press</i>.]</p>, <p><i>Education and Family Assistance Legislation </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, when can Americans expect to see the impact of the infrastructure bill? And when do you think the Build Back Better bill will be passed: by Thanksgiving, Christmas?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I don't want to make your job easier.

[<i>Laughter</i>] And I know exactly how it's going to—[<i>laughter</i>].</p>, <p><i>Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act/The President's Optimism </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>But when can Americans see the impact from this bill?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>President Biden——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> So when will——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, they'll see the effects of the bill—this bill—probably starting within the next 2 to 3 months. As we get things—shovels in grounds and—in the ground—and people being told they're going to be working doing the following things. And things are going to move.</p>, <p>It is a bill that's paid out over a number of years. And so—but the money—the biggest thing it does is give people—you're going to have people going: ""Oh, okay. I guess I'm going to be able to keep my job,"" or ""I'm going to be able to get a job doing that,"" or ""I'm moving.""</p>, <p>So I can't tell you that—any of that with precision. If anybody can, then they ought to go into fortunetelling.

[<i>Laughter</i>] She's got to stand and listen to the President, but she deserves an enormous amount of the credit.</p>, <p>But here's the deal. When we came to office, we were told virtually by everybody, ""You can't get this economy moving."" Remember?</p>, <p>Remember when they told me there was no way I could get, you know, 2 million shots a day into people's arms in the beginning? ""There's no million—no way to get 200 million."" They said there's no way I could get the vaccine. ""There's no way, no way, no way.""</p>, <p>It's understandable. It's not—it's—I'm not criticizing people who said that, because these things have never been done before. It's never happened before. And so we got to work.</p>, <p>I agree I am a congenital optimist, but it's because—I really mean this—I have enormous faith in the ingenuity and the integrity of the American people. I'm not joking. I have enormous faith in them. Because I'm convinced we're the most unique country in the world—not because we're all so smart and the rest, but because we're the only country that's organized based on an idea.</p>, <p>We really mean it. We haven't lived up to it, but: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident. All men and women are created equal."" Basically, give everybody a shot.</p>, <p>And I really have faith in the American people. I know we're divided, I know how mean it can get, and I know there are extremes on both ends that make it more difficult than it's been in a long, long time.</p>, <p>But I'm convinced: If we let the American people know that we're committed to enhancing their ability to make their way, we'll all do better.</p>, <p>Thank you all so very much.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> President Biden—[<i>inaudible</i>]—lawsuits?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Will Democrats have to go it alone?</p>]"
3,8,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Report on the Employment Situation in October,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-bureau-labor-statistics-report-the-employment-situation-october,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good morning.</p>, <p>Today is another great day for our economic recovery. America is getting back to work. Our economy is starting to work for more Americans. Thanks to the economic plan we've put through in Congress earlier this year and a successful vaccine deployment, America continues to add jobs at a record pace.</p>, <p>In this historically strong recovery, unemployment rate has fallen again today down to 4.6 percent. This included a substantial drop in unemployment for Hispanics, which was much needed. Our economy is on the move. This morning we learned that in October, our economy created 531,000 jobs, well above expectations.</p>, <p>We also learned that job growth over the prior 2 months, August and September, was nearly 250,000 more jobs than previously thought. In total, the job creation in the first full 9 months of my administration is about 5.6 million new jobs, a record for any new President. That's a monthly average of over 60,000 [600,000]* new jobs each month, 10 times more than the job creation at three months before I took office.</p>, <p>New unemployment claims have fallen every week for the past 5 weeks, are down by more than 60 percent since I took office, and are now at the lowest level since the pandemic started. And people continue to move from unemployment rolls to work. Unemployment has decreased this year by more than any other year since 1950. So any year since 1950, unemployment has decreased more in this year than since 1950.</p>, <p>And not only are more Americans working, working Americans are seeing their paychecks go up. Weekly pay went up in October, with an average hourly earnings up almost 5 percent this year.</p>, <p>That's more than some of the lowest—that's more than some of the lowest paid workers in our country—men and women who work in restaurants, hotels, the entertainment industry have seen their pay go up 12 percent this year.</p>, <p>Over 5½ million jobs. Unemployment down at record pace to 4.6 percent. And before we passed the Rescue Plan, forecasters said it would take until the end of 2023—to the end of 2023—to get to 4.6 unemployment rate. Today we've reached that rate 2 years before forecasters thought it was possible. I would humbly suggest this is a significant improvement from when I took office and a sign that we're on the right track. This did not happen by accident or just because.</p>, <p>We laid the foundation for this recovery with my American Rescue Plan that Congress passed at the beginning of my term. It put money in working families' pockets. It gave families with kids a tax cut each month. It helped keep small businesses going in the dark days earlier this year. And it provided the resources needed to launch one of the fastest mass vaccination programs ever.</p>, <p>We got more than 220 million shots in arms in my first 100 days. And we didn't stop there. In recent months, we've started implementing vaccination requirements, which have helped bring the number of unvaccinated adults down in this country from around 100 million several months ago to 60 million now.</p>, <p>You know, that's good for our health, but it's also good for our economy. Now vaccine—vaccinated workers are going back to work. Vaccinated shoppers are going back to stores. And with the launch of the vaccine for kids ages 5 through 11 this week, we can make sure more vaccinated children can stay in school.</p>, <p>These plans I've implemented—through these plans of economic—economic success, the economic rescue, and vaccination plans, just both of them, have made the economy the envy of the world. We're the fastest growing major economy and one creating jobs at a faster pace than anyone.</p>, <p>Yet—yes, there's—you know, there's a lot more to be done. We still have to tackle the costs that American families are facing. But this recovery is faster, stronger, and fairer, and wider than almost anyone could have predicted. That's what the numbers say.</p>, <p>But we want to make sure that people continue to feel it in their lives, in their bank accounts, in their hopes and expectations for a tomorrow that's better than today. That's what this is all about: making sure our recovery is fully felt.</p>, <p>To determine that depends on two things, two things that are entirely within our reach. The first: For our economy to fully recover, we need to keep driving vaccinations up and COVID down.</p>, <p>In that effort, we took two major steps this week. On Tuesday, the CDC recommended COVID-19 vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11. We prepared for this moment by securing enough vaccine supply for every single child in that age category in America. Those doses have started to arrive at thousands of pediatricians' offices, pharmacies, schools, and other sites.</p>, <p>As a parent of one of the first children to receive a shot said, quote, ""Today is such a huge sigh of relief."" End of quote. Starting next week, our kids vaccination program will hit full strength, with about 20,000 trusted and convenient places for parents to get their kids vaccinated.</p>, <p>And yesterday the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, issued a rule to require employers with 100 or more employees to ensure that each of their workers is fully vaccinated or tests negative for COVID-19 at least once a week. And the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a rule requiring that all workers at health care facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid are fully vaccinated.</p>, <p>Together, these rules, along with other requirements we've put in place, means that two thirds of all workers in the United States are now covered by vaccination requirements. These requirements have broad public support, and they work.</p>, <p>Already, we've seen organizations that have adopted vaccination requirements increase their vaccination rates by more than 20 percentage points, often as high as 90 percent—over 90 percent. This is good for the workers, for their colleagues, for their loved ones, and for their communities. And it's also good for the economy.</p>, <p>In a recent University of Chicago survey, every economist agreed that requiring staff vaccinations or regular testing among large employers would promote the economic recovery that is faster and stronger even than it is now.</p>, <p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs project that these kinds of requirements could lead to up to 5 million more Americans reentering the workforce. That's because they feel safer to do so. It's because there are fewer disruptions to things like childcare.</p>, <p>Again, beating COVID-19 remains one of the most important ways to strengthen our economy, not just save lives, but strengthen our economy. And we're making progress.</p>, <p>As of this week, 70 percent of American adults are fully vaccinated, more than 193 million Americans fully vaccinated. It was less than 1 percent when we took office 10 months ago.</p>, <p>And one more piece of good news: Last night we received promising news about another potent and potential COVID treatment: a pill—a pill developed by Pfizer that may dramatically reduce the risk of being hospitalized or dying when taken shortly after infection, if you're infected.</p>, <p>If authorized by the FDA, we may soon have pills that may treat the virus of those who become infected. We have already secured millions of doses. And the therapy would be another tool in our toolbox to protect people from what—the worst outcomes of COVID.</p>, <p>But look, it's important to remember: We need to prevent infections, not wait to treat them once they happen. And vaccination remains the best way to do that.</p>, <p>The pandemic is not yet behind us, but within this week's announcements—vaccines for kids, more adults getting vaccinated, potential treatment for those who get sick—we're accelerating in our path out of this pandemic.</p>, <p>The second way to make sure recovery is fully felt is to pass our bipartisan—my bipartisan infrastructure agreement and my Build Back Better plan, which are being debated now. And I'm going to be heading over there quickly—shortly after I do this press conference—back to my office to make some calls. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>I want to say very clearly: If your number-one issue is the cost of living, the number-one priority should be seeing Congress pass these bills. Seventeen Nobel Prize winners in economics have said—spontaneously wrote to me, together, and said this will lower inflationary pressure on the economy when we pass my bills.</p>, <p>A new analysis from the Wall Street firm of Moody's Analytics found that it will ease the financial burden of inflation for middle class families. Put another way: These will—these bills will provide families with, as my dad used to say, ""just a little more breathing room."" That's because the Build Back Better framework lowers your bills for health care, childcare, prescription drugs, and preschool. And families get a tax cut.</p>, <p>That's how you end some of the anxiety people are feeling about the economy. That's how we give people some breathing room.</p>, <p>That's in addition to the infrastructure bill that will create millions of jobs rebuilding the arteries of our economy. And by the way, these two bills add up to the largest effort to combat climate change in the history of the United States of America.</p>, <p>Right now we stand on the cusp of historic economic progress. It's two bills that, together, will create millions of jobs, grow the economy, invest in our Nation and our people, lower costs for families, and turn the climate crisis into an opportunity and put us on a path not only to compete, but to win the economic competition for the 21st century against all comers.</p>, <p>And passing these bills will say clearly to the American people: We hear your voices. We're going to invest in your hopes, help you secure a brighter future for yourself and for your families, and make sure that America wins the future in the process.</p>, <p>I'm asking every House Member—Member of the House of Representatives to vote ""yes"" on both these bills right now. Send the infrastructure bill to my desk. Send the Build Back Better bill to the Senate.</p>, <p>Let's build on incredible economic progress, build on what we've already done. Because this will be such a boost when it occurs. Let's show the world that America's democracy can deliver and propel our economy forward. Now, let's get this done.</p>, <p>I'll be back to answer some of your questions when they pass. But may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Without a CBO score, sir?</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Did paid family leave make it in, Mr. President?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Without a CBO score, the House——</p>]"
3,9,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Recommendation of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for Children Ages 5 to 11 and Booster Shots for Older Americans and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-recommendation-the-pfizer-biontech,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good afternoon, folks.</p>, <p>Get my mask here. Today is a great day for American parents, American families, and American children. We've taken a giant step forward to further accelerate our path out of this pandemic.</p>, <p>After months of rigorous and independent scientific review, the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, authorized and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, recommended the COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 through 11.</p>, <p>For parents all over this country, this is a day of relief and celebration. After almost 18 months of anxious worrying every time that children—your child had a sniffle or started to cough, well, you can now protect them from this horrible virus, because that would always worry that it was coming along.</p>, <p>Twenty-eight million more young Americans are now eligible for the protection of a vaccine, and my administration is ready—we're ready from day one, today—organized, and have a plan for this vaccination's launch.</p>, <p>As soon as next week, we will have enough vaccine in enough places, and parents will be able to schedule appointments to get their kids their first shot. And we've already secured enough vaccine supply for every single child in America ages 5 through 11.</p>, <p>And weeks ago, we asked States and pharmacies to put together their detailed plan to start placing their orders for these specially formulated vaccines for young children. We started packing and shipping these orders last week, as soon as the FDA authorized the vaccine.</p>, <p>And we've already sent millions of doses—excuse me——</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President coughed.</i>]</p>, <p>——millions of doses, and millions more to come by next week. These doses will be available at approximately—excuse me——</p>, <p>[<i>The President coughed.</i>]</p>, <p>I beg your pardon; I swallowed wrong—will be available in approximately 20,000 locations around the country. These include places that parents know and trust: their local pharmacies, their pediatricians, family doctors, and children's hospitals.</p>, <p>Many of the vaccine sites will offer times on nights and weekends so parents can take their children to get vaccinated after work and after school. We've also been working with Governors, mayors, and local school leaders to bring vaccines to schools. As of today, more than 6,000 school clinics have already been planned in school districts around the country.</p>, <p>These efforts will also ensure equity that—is the center of our children's vaccination program, as has been—as it has been the vaccination program for adults. We're making vaccines available at hundreds of community health centers, rural health clinics, and thousands of pharmacies and schools in our hardest hit communities. And we're sending out mobile units to reach where the people are.</p>, <p>The bottom line is: We've been planning and preparing for months to vaccinate our children. Our program will be ramping up this week and more doses shipped out each day so that we have fully—we are fully up and running by next week.</p>, <p>Now, I know that many parents have been anxiously waiting for this day, but I also know that some families might have questions. So trusted messengers—like your pediatricians, family doctors—will be able to answer your questions, talk to parents about the importance of getting their kids vaccinated, and put your mind at ease.</p>, <p>We'll also be raising awareness and encouraging parents to get their children vaccinated, from our level. Just when we've been doing—that's what we've been doing since day one of my administration. And we're going to do everything we can to make these vaccines easily available and raise awareness of the importance of getting vaccinated.</p>, <p>So, parents of children ages 5 and older, please get them vaccinated. Because here's the deal: Children make up one-quarter of the cases in this country. And while rare, children can get very sick from COVID-19. And some can end up—few—but end up hospitalized. But they don't have to.</p>, <p>This vaccine is safe and effective. So get your children vaccinated to protect themselves, to protect others, and to stop the spread and to help us beat this pandemic.</p>, <p>Today I also want to speak to America's seniors. While everyone is at risk of getting COVID-19, the evidence is overwhelming that older Americans are still, by far, the most vulnerable to getting the sickest. And boosters—boosters—add an important layer of protection. Booster shots are free and effective, and every senior should get one. It's important.</p>, <p>Seniors are eligible to get your booster shot 6 months after you've been fully vaccinated. So 6 months. If you got your second shot before May the 1st, you are eligible to get the booster right now. And I've made it clear: We have ample supply of boosters.</p>, <p>And thanks to our planning and preparation, our booster program is off to a very strong start. Over 20 million Americans have now received a booster. In fact, in just 6 weeks, we've already gotten boosters to about half the eligible seniors who received the Pfizer vaccine. Nearly half of the eligible seniors in just 6 weeks.</p>, <p>It took nearly 11 weeks to get half of all seniors their first shot for that—when that program was launched back in December of 2020, just during the prior administration. So, as a—this is a strong pace. To our seniors: If you're eligible, get your booster now.</p>, <p>I'll conclude with this: Vaccines for children ages 5 to 11 and boosters [to]* provide additional protection for seniors and others are two major steps forward that are going to accelerate our path out of this pandemic.</p>, <p>And this brings me to where we are and where we're going to go from here: Since early September, cases and hospitalizations are down now more than 50 percent. And over the past 2 weeks, cases and hospitalizations are falling in approximately 40 States.</p>, <p>A year ago, we had no vaccines. Just this week, we hit an important milestone: 80 percent of adults have at least one shot. That's four out of every five adults. And for our seniors, over 95 percent have gotten at least one shot.</p>, <p>Overall, 193 million Americans are fully vaccinated, up from just 2 million the day I was sworn in. Over 20 million have enhanced protections from boosters. And we're now down from 100 [million]* to about 60 million unvaccinated Americans 12 years and older. And I'm proud to say, Black and Brown adults and Native Americans have gotten vaccinated at the same rate as White adults.</p>, <p>And one more thing: Our vaccination program is not only helping to save lives and beat the pandemic, it's helping our economic recovery and helping us grow. In the 3 months before I came to office, the economy was stagnant, creating only 60,000 jobs a month. Since I've taken office, it's now averaging 600,000 new jobs every month. That's the average.</p>, <p>And one more thing: Vaccinating our children will help us keep our schools open, keep our kids in the classroom, learning and socializing with their classmates and teachers. I think every reporter in this room who has a child understands the difference of a child going to school and having to learn from home. It matters. It matters in terms of their not just physical health and mental health.</p>, <p>You know, during this pandemic, we've seen just how important being in school is for our families and for our country. A year ago, we were heading into a Thanksgiving where public health were—experts were advising against traveling or gathering with family and friends.</p>, <p>Last Thanksgiving, for the first time, it was just four of us—my wife and I, our daughter and her—and my son-in-law. Later this month, our tables and our hearts are going to be filled, thanks to the vaccines.</p>, <p>We've made incredible progress over these past 9 months, but we have to keep going. The pandemic is not yes yet behind us, but we're getting there. So, please—please—do your part. If you know someone who is not vaccinated, encourage them to get vaccinated.</p>, <p>And folks—folks who haven't gotten vaccinated yet, please get vaccinated. It's easy. It's accessible. And it's free. Get vaccinated. You can do this.</p>, <p>May God bless you all.</p>, <p>And I'll take a few questions.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, on the outcome on Virginia——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, a quick one——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'll start all the way at the end.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you, Mr. President. Appreciate it.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, you're not all the way at the end, but that's okay. You're up. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Voter Participation/Virginia Democratic Gubernatorial Candidate Terence R. McAuliffe/The President's Economic Agenda </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>As leader of the Democratic Party, how much responsibility do you take for the dismal results in Virginia and beyond last night?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, look, yesterday reminded me of the—that one of the scared rights we have is to be able to go out and cast our votes. And remember that we all have an obligation to accept the legitimacy of these elections.</p>, <p>I was talking to Terry to congratulate him today. He got 600,000 more votes than any Democrat ever has gotten. We brought out every Democrat about there was. More votes than ever has been cast for a Democratic incumbent—I mean, not incumbent—a Democrat running for Governor. And no Governor in Virginia has ever won when he is of the same—where he or she is the same party as the sitting President.</p>, <p>What I do know is—I do know that people want us to get things done. They want us to get things done. And that's why I'm continuing to push very hard for the Democratic Party to move along and pass my infrastructure bill and my Build Back Better bill.</p>, <p>I think if we—look, think about what we—what we're talking about here. People are upset and uncertain about a lot of things—from COVID, to school, to jobs, to a whole range of things, and the cost of a gallon of gasoline.</p>, <p>And so, if I'm able to pass—sign into law my Build Back Better initiative, I'm in a position where you're going to see a lot of those things ameliorated quickly and swiftly. And so that has to be done.</p>, <p><i>Virginia Gubernatorial Election </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>So, Mr. President—Mr. President, given what you've said, do you take some responsibility? And do you think that Terry McAuliffe would have won if your agenda had passed before election day?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I think we should have—it should have passed before election day. But I'm not sure that I would be able to have changed the number of very conservative folks who turned out in the red districts who were Trump voters. But maybe. Maybe.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>You won the State by 10 points, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I know we did. But I—we also—I was running against Donald Trump.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you, Mr. President. I have a——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>The President's Legislative Agenda/Cost-of-Living Issues </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>What should Democrats possibly do differently to avoid similar losses in November, especially as Republicans are now successfully running on culture-war issues and false claims about critical race theory?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I think we should produce for the American people. Look, one of the things that is important to understand: If—if they pass my legislation, we're going to be able to reduce the price—people are going to see a reduction in the price of the drugs they—they have to get because Medicare will be able to negotiate and lower the price of drugs.</p>, <p>If they pass my legislation, you're going to see that nobody—and some of you who have children in daycare or children in childcare, you're paying up to $14,000 a year if you live here. You will never have to pay that much money if you live in Washington or wherever you live. No more than 17 percent—7 percent of your income. They're going to see that, you know, they'll get tax breaks—I mean, genuine tax breaks.</p>, <p>[<i>A cell phone rang.</i>]</p>, <p>If that's Trump, then tell him I'm busy. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>But, Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That was bad—bad joke.</p>, <p>But anyway, but the point is that, you know, we have to move and make it clear that what we've done is increasing their—look, people need a little breathing room. They're overwhelmed. And what happened was, I think we have to just produce results for them to change their standard of living and give them a little more breathing room.</p>, <p><i>The President's Outreach to African American Voters </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>My question is, though——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Can you just—what's your message, though, for Democratic voters, especially Black voters who see Republicans running on race, education—lying about critical race theory—and they're worried that Democrats don't have an effective way to push back on that?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I think that the whole answer is just to speak the truth, lay out where we are.</p>, <p>Look, I'm convinced that if you look at everything from my view on criminal justice system, to my view on equal opportunity, to my view on economic issues, and all the things that I have and what I've been pushing in legislation—each of the elements are overwhelmingly popular. We have to speak to them though. We have to speak them and explain them.</p>, <p>Look, I just think people are at a point—and it's understandable—where there's a whole lot of confusion. Everything from: ""Are you going to ever get COVID under control?""; to ""Are my kids going to be in school? Are they going to be able to stay in school?""; to ""Whether or not I'm going to get a tax break that allows me to be able to pay for the needs of my kids and my family?""</p>, <p>And they're all things that we're—that we're going to—that I'm running on—that we'll run on. And I think we'll do fine.</p>, <p><i>Immigration </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, right here. Right here, Mr. President. Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> This ought to be good.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>I think so too.</p>, <p>About the way forward, Mr. President: As you were leaving for your overseas trip, there were reports that were surfacing that your administration is planning to pay illegal immigrants who are separated from their families at the border up to $450,000 each, possibly a million dollars per family. Do you think that that might incentivize more people to come over illegally?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> If you guys keep sending that garbage out, yes. But it's not true.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>So this is a ""garbage"" report?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Okay. So you——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Four hundred and fifty—$450,000 per person. Is that what you're saying?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>That was separated from a family member at the border under the last administration.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That's not going to happen.</p>, <p><i>Former President Donald J. Trump </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Okay. And then just a follow-up, because you mentioned Trump a couple times. When you went to try to help Terry McAuliffe in—a couple weeks ago, before you left, you mentioned Trump 24 times. Do you still think that voters really want to hear you talking about Trump more than the issues affecting them every day?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, the reason I mentioned Trump—I didn't count the times—is because the issues he supports are affecting their lives every day and they're a negative impact on their lives, in my view.</p>, <p>Thank you all very much. I appreciate it.</p>, <p>[<i>Several reporters began asking questions at once.</i>]</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>[<i>Inaudible</i>]—election, sir, is the Democratic Party——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> What is your message to congressional Democrats on getting that bill passed?</p>, <p><i>The President</i>. Get it to my desk.</p>]"

To start, to state the obvious, we have to immediately scale up clean technologies that are already commercially available and cost-competitive, like wind and solar energy.</p>, <p>In the United States, we've set a goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030, creating tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs for American workers and meeting the power needs of almost 10,000 [10 million]* American homes every year. We can do this now. We don't have to wait.</p>, <p>At the same time, we recognize that our current technology alone won't get us where we need to be. So it must also be a decisive decade for innovation: developing, demonstrating, and commercializing new clean energy technologies by 2030 so that we can—they can be widely deployed in time to meet our 2050 net-zero goals.</p>, <p>Clean hydrogen, long-duration energy storage, next-generation renewables and nuclear, carbon capture, sustainable agriculture, and so much more. We need to invest in breakthroughs, and I welcome the U.K.'s leadership on the Glasgow Breakthrough agenda.</p>, <p>Innovation is the key to unlocking our future. That's why the United States is working to quadruple funding for clean energy research and development over the next 4 years. And we'll lead a year of action in 2022 to advance clean technologies globally.</p>, <p>Over the past 2 days, I've announced several U.S. Government-led initiatives to help develop and scale clean energy transmission, but we can't achieve our goals through government action alone.</p>, <p>I'm looking at some of the men and women in front of me that can help accelerate and develop clean energy technologies. The United States and the World Economic Forum are launching the First Movers Coalition. So let me explain what the First Movers Coalition is—and I expect that you already know.</p>, <p>The First Movers Coalition is starting with more than two dozen of the world's largest and most innovative companies. The coalition represents eight major sectors that comprise 30 percent of the global emissions we now are dealing with: steel, shipping, aluminum, concrete, trucking, aviation, chemicals, and direct air capture.</p>, <p>These companies will be critical partners in pushing for commercially viable alternatives to decarbonize the industrial—these industrial sectors and more, and while championing the U.S. innovation of good-paying jobs at the same time. And the U.S. Government is going to use our enormous market power as the world's largest buyer of goods and services—some $650 billion in acquisitions annually—to do the same. The Government purchases that much.</p>, <p>Together, these policies, God-willing, will spur a wave of new and better products into the market, and new companies and projects that will create good-paying jobs. So we're attacking the challenge from both ends. We're sending the demand signal loud and clear, and investing in research and development to expand supply.</p>, <p>We don't just want to innovate in the industrial sector; the agricultural sector also has a vital role to play. As stewards of the land, our farmers belong on the frontlines of the climate fight.</p>, <p>And together with the United Arab Emirates, I'm proud to announce the launch of the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate, AIM for Climate. This is something we first proposed at my Leaders' Summit on Climate. Over the last 6 months, we've worked for more than—with more than 75 partners to catalyze public and private investment in climate-smart agriculture and food system innovation.</p>, <p>Today, along with 75 partners, we're going to launch a $4 billion initial investment globally. And the United States is planning to mobilize a billion of that $4 billion over the next 5 years. And I invite all of you to join us in working to double the investment by the time we meet at COP27.</p>, <p>As with every aspect of the climate crisis, no one can do this alone. We need all of us working together. I know you're tired of hearing that said; it's said over and over and over again. But it's true.</p>, <p>And as we do, the United States will lead by example and share with the world our considerable powers of innovation. And, as my grandfather would say, ""with the grace of God and the good will of the neighbors and the creek not rising,"" we're going to make a lot of progress.</p>, <p>All kidding aside, I think there's virtually nothing we're unable to do, particularly when we do it together.</p>, <p>And, again, I want to thank all the private sector for their work. Thank you.</p>]"

Biden,"Remarks on the Global Methane Pledge at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-global-methane-pledge-the-united-nations-climate-change-conference-glasgow,"[<p>Well, it's very easy to follow Ursula. I think she says it all well the first time.</p>, <p>Look, I'm going to be very, very brief. I want to thank Ursula. And thank you so much to everyone here today, you know, for signing this game-changing commitment.</p>, <p>One of the most important things we can do—and I keep referring, as many of you do, to this decisive decade. We've got to figure what we're going to do. It's not just between now and 2050. What we're going to do between now and 2030 is going to impact significantly on what we'll—whether we'll be able to meet our longer term commitment.</p>, <p>And one of the most important things we can do in this decisive decade is—to keep 1.5 degrees in reach—is reduce our methane emissions as quickly as possible. As has already been stated, it's one of the most potent greenhouse gases there is. It amounts to about half—half—the warming we're experiencing today, just the methane exposure.</p>, <p>So, together, we're committing to collectively reduce our methane by 30 percent by 2030. And I think we can probably go beyond that. We just announced this package at the General Assembly in—back in September. At the time, it was mentioned, nine countries had signed on. Today, it's over 80—it's approaching 100—countries that are signing on. That's nearly half the global methane emissions or 70 percent of the global GDP.</p>, <p>And it's not—this is going to make a huge difference. And not just when it comes to fighting climate change, as Ursula pointed out—the physical health of individuals and a whole range of other things. It's going to improve health, reduce asthma, respiratory-related emergencies. It's going to improve the food supply as well by cutting crop losses and related ground-level pollution. And it's going to boost our economies, saving companies money, reducing methane leaks, capturing methane to turn it into new revenue streams, and—as well as creating good-paying union jobs for our workers.</p>, <p>And we're taking—and we're talking about jobs to manufacture new technologies for methane detection; jobs for union pipefitters and welders to go out and cap abandoned oil wells and plug leaking pipelines, which there's thousands of miles of those.</p>, <p>And it has been a foundation—the foundational commitment of my administration from the beginning. It's something that we—I campaigned on. And today I'm announcing the next steps to reduce U.S. methane emissions.</p>, <p>We're proposing two new rules: one through our Environmental Protection Agency that's going to reduce methane losses from new and existing oil and gas pipelines; and one through the Department of Transportation to reduce wasteful and potential dangerous leaks from natural gas pipelines. They have authority over that area.</p>, <p>We're also launching a new initiative to work with our farmers and our ranchers to introduce climate-smart agriculture practices and reduce methane on farms, which is a significant source as well.</p>, <p>And this is all part of our new methane strategy, which focuses on reducing the largest source of methane emissions while putting thousands—thousands—of skilled workers on the job all across the United States and, I expect, in your countries as well.</p>, <p>So let me close again by reiterating, this isn't just something we have to do to protect our environment and our future, it's an enormous opportunity—enormous opportunity—for all of us, all of our nations to create jobs and make meeting climate goals a core part of our global economic recovery as well.</p>, <p>The United States is eager to work with each of you to make sure we meet this goal and encourage more countries—more countries—to join us in committing to reducing methane globally, because there are more that can join and should.</p>, <p>So I want to thank you again. Much more to say, but much of it has already been said. But thank you for your partnership. Thank you for your ambition.</p>, <p>And now I'm going to turn it back to Secretary Kerry. I believe he's still here. There he is.</p>, <p>And I thank you all so very much.</p>]"
4,2,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks in a Meeting on the Build Back Better World Initiative at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-meeting-the-build-back-better-world-initiative-the-united-nations-climate-change,"[<p>Hello, everyone. Thank you all for making the time amid these very packed schedules we all have.</p>, <p>We're gathered here at COP26 to emphasize how the choices we make today—and I literally mean today—will resonate for decades to come. This is especially true when it comes to infrastructure. And the choices to build, for example, a coal plant today instead of a solar or wind farm could mean that—another 30 years of burning fossil fuels. Expanding a road instead of investing in mass transit could shape a city for a generation and the carbon footprint in that city.</p>, <p>Every choice we make in this decisive decade—and I mean it literally, between now and 2030—has to bring us closer—closer to, not push us further away from, a sustainable path to net-zero emissions by 2050. That recognition was front and center when I announced the Build Back Better World initiative in June, along with our G-7 partners.</p>, <p>But to put this in perspective, the Build Back Better initiative, the Clean Green Initiative of Great Britain, the Global Gateway and Clean Green initiatives are all part of a joint effort among the G-7 partners to deliver high-quality, sustainable infrastructure. And I want to thank Ursula for the Clean Green Initiative as well. I mean, it's—we're all on the same team with, essentially, the same issues.</p>, <p>There is an urgent need for infrastructure development in countries—infrastructure that prioritize, when you build it—it prioritizes the fight against climate change from the moment the spade goes in the ground, and jump-starts the green economic growth. That's what I'm focused on in the United States. But it isn't just an American project, it's work we all have to do and we all are doing around this table.</p>, <p>By ensuring high standards—high standards—for our projects, we can create infrastructure that lifts up communities and begins to lift them up now and does not put them behind the eight ball—or that's a bad expression to use—but put them behind the curve when it comes to 2, 5, 10, 15 years from now. Being transparent about how we're financing our projects, we offer positive alternatives to debt traps and corruption. We can hold entire countries back if we don't do that. Transparency is critically important.</p>, <p>And by insisting and responding to the needs of developing countries rather than dictating projects from afar, we can deliver the greatest impact for those who need it the most. By mobilizing trillions of dollars of investment capital that's sitting on the sidelines, that can multiply the impact of our country investments in a significant way.</p>, <p>And by coming together to make a difference in the lives of people all around the world, we have to show—and I think we will show—that democracy is still the best way for delivering results. Let me say it again: Democracy is still the best way for delivering results.</p>, <p>That is my vision of the Build Back Better World. But my guess is, it's my colleagues' vision as well, and I'm eager to hear from all of you today, quite frankly. And to start the conversation, I'd like to propose five key principles that should guide our investments in infrastructure.</p>, <p>First, every project should be climate resilient and developed with climate in mind. Every project that's started, we should think about it from the perspective of climate. I mean that sincerely. New transportation infrastructure should be designed with sea-level rise in mind. Health care and digital infrastructure should be built to withstand extreme weather events. And in this decade, to invest in wind, solar, hydropower, and more.</p>, <p>Today, as part of this commitment, the United States—together with the U.K., France, Germany, and the EU—is announcing a new partnership with South Africa to help transform their economy to a clean energy economy more quickly.</p>, <p>Right now South Africa is the largest emitter in Africa, due in large part to the heavy reliance on coal for power. By closing South Africa's coal plants ahead of schedule and investing in clean power alternatives for the people of South Africa and supporting an equitable and inclusive transition in South Africa's coal sector, we're following through on the pledge the G-7 partners made in Cornwall to accelerate the transition away from coal in developing countries.</p>, <p>And I realize the reliance on coal is consequential. But I can remember growing up as a young man in an area that was a heavy supplier of coal in Northeast Pennsylvania. And I watched what happened when it collapsed and how the—the impact on the community. And that's why we have to take care of the people who are impacted on and provide alternatives for them as well.</p>, <p>By closing South Africa's coal plants ahead of schedule and investing in clean alternatives the people of South Africa—for the people of South Africa, and supporting equitable and inclusive transitions in South Africa's coal sector, we're following through, as I said, on the pledge we had—we made.</p>, <p>The second point I'd like to make: All our projects should be designed in close partnership with the countries where they will happen—where they will happen. It's a simple but powerful principle: Projects will only be successful, in my view, when there is buy-in, input, and engagement from the communities they're intended to help and impact. I learned that yesterday from Barbados. [<i>Laughter</i>] Actually, I think I knew it ahead of time, but you made a, really, very compelling speech yesterday. Local governments, labor, and civil society should be engaged from the very start to make sure the benefits to the community are equitable and they're immediate.</p>, <p>Thirdly, the Build Back Better World project should be high quality and high standards. What does that mean in practice? Well, it means whenever there's something to purchase or someone to hire, we'll use transparent and competitive processes that safeguard against corruption. It means we'll provide affordable financing so local taxpayers aren't stuck with a big bill they can't pay down the line. It means environmental planning to reduce the risk of damaging the ecosystem and increase the resilience to climate change.</p>, <p>And fourthly, partnership is essential. To reach net-zero by 2050, we're going to need to mobilize trillions of dollars—as our friends at the end of the table know—trillions of dollars in financing to harness both private- and public-sector resources. I met with some of these private-sector suppliers earlier today. I think it's within our capacity to do that, led by the men at the end of the table, and harness both private- and public-sector resources.</p>, <p>So I look forward to working with the World Bank President, David Malpass, and Mark Carney, who is now with the U.N., about how to mobilize the private sector and international financial institutions to help build a pipeline of projects that we can invest in, but can be counted on and planned for, and be done in regular order.</p>, <p>And finally, as you keep hearing me say—and I apologize—building out our climate infrastructure can and should help drive a sustainable economic recovery. From the first meeting we had, I kept—I know I'm—I apologize for the repetition—but I look at climate and dealing with climate change, and I see jobs. Good jobs, economic development, and movement—that's what I see.</p>, <p>And finally, you keep hearing me say it, but building out the climate infrastructure should drive sustainable economic recovery. It can spur the creation of those good jobs in the developing world just like it can in the developed world.</p>, <p>Our global transition to a net-zero economy is predicated on 30 million new jobs worldwide by 2030. Thirty million new jobs, good-paying jobs. So this climate crisis is an enormous opportunity. It's about jobs. It's about building the industries of the future. It's about making sure everyone shares in the benefits of an equitable and sustainable green recovery.</p>, <p>A Build Back Better World is going to show that we can grow our economies, fight climate change, and leave a better, cleaner, more livable planet for all of our children.</p>, <p>So I want to thank you all for joining us today. And now I'd like to turn it over to a woman who I think impresses me every time I hear her speak, President von der Leyen, to make a few remarks.<i> </i></p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the meeting continued; no transcript was provided.</i>]</p>]"

Biden,"Remarks on Forests and Land Use at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-forests-and-land-use-the-united-nations-climate-change-conference-glasgow-united,"[<p>Good morning, everyone. It's an honor to be with you. My fellow leaders, I'm honored to represent the United States in this important discussion.</p>, <p>Conserving our forests and other critical ecosystems is indispensable, an indispensable piece of keeping our climate goals within reach as well as many other key priorities that we have together: ensuring clean water, maintaining biodiversity, supporting rural and Indigenous communities, and reducing the risk of the spread of disease.</p>, <p>Our forests are also nature's carbon capture, cycling CO2 out of our atmosphere. And I want to recognize the Presidents of the [Democratic]* Republic of the Congo and Gabon, who are here today, for their considerable commitment to conserve—to conserve their forests.</p>, <p>If we all work together to make sure these precious resources are conserved in Africa and around the world, forests have the potential to reduce carbon globally by more than one-third—by more than one-third.</p>, <p>So we need to approach this issue with the same seriousness of purpose as decarbonizing our economies. That's what we're doing in the United States. We've already exceeded the 2020 Bonn Challenge goal of more than 20 million hectares of forest land under restoration thus far.</p>, <p>During my first week in office, I issued an Executive order that set the goal of conserving at least 30 percent of all U.S. lands and waters by the year 2030. We have put a—in place protections for the Tongass Forest in Alaska, the world's largest intact temperate rainforest.</p>, <p>And today I'm announcing a new plan to conserve global forests, which will bring together the full range of U.S. Government tools—diplomatic, financial, and policy—to halt forest loss, restore critical carbon sinks, and improve land management.</p>, <p>Through this plan, the United States will help the world deliver on our shared goal of halting natural forest loss and restoring at least an additional 200 million hectares of forests and other ecosystems by the year 2030. This is a plan that is the first of its kind, taking a whole-of-Government approach and working, in our case, with Congress to deploy up to $9 billion in U.S. funding through 2030 to conserve and restore our forests and mobilize billions more from our partners.</p>, <p>As part of this, we're going to work to ensure markets recognize the true economic value of natural carbon sinks and motivate governments, landowners, and stakeholders to prioritize conservation. We'll work to align the private sector investment flows in our climate and conservation goals, including reducing the drivers of deforestation, creating sustainable supply chains, pursuing more sustainable commodity sourcing.</p>, <p>At every step, we'll work in partnership with the people most impacted by deforestation and most experienced in sustainable land management—local communities, Indigenous people, local governments, civil societies—to make sure our approaches are effective and focused on the needs of vulnerable populations.</p>, <p>Preserving forests and other ecosystems can and should play an important role in meeting our ambitious climate goals as part of the net-zero emissions strategy we all have. And the United States is going to lead by our example at home and support other forested nations and developing countries in setting and achieving ambitious action to conserve and restore these carbon sinks.</p>, <p>I'm confident we can do this. All we need to do is summon the will to do what we know is right and we know is necessary and we know is within our capacity. So, as simple as it sounds, I think it is this simple. Let's get to work. We can do this. And it will have a generational impact.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>]"

[<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> I'm sorry.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> That's okay. No, I'm happy to.</p>, <p>To my fellow leaders, we're all here gathered in Glasgow because, I think, this is a critical decade. It's not just where we are in 2050, but this decade is going to determine whether we meet our goals, in my view.</p>, <p>And when future historians look back on the 2020s, in my view, I think they'll find that we let this final chance to stem the crisis slip through our fingers because we did too little or failed to act. Or are they going to say that in the 2020s, we stepped up and we saw—that we took the kind of actions that—to unite the world and do what's necessary—the larger countries—to meet our broader obligations beyond our own countries?</p>, <p>Action and solidarity, that's what's required. We all know it. And I'll—I apologize if I'm repeating some of what you've already said. The United States, if I have anything to do with it, will do our part. As I said earlier today, we've set ambitious goals of reducing U.S. greenhouse gases emissions by 50 to 52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. That's a goal in line with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But the math only works if every country does its part and those countries that don't have the wherewithal get the kind of help they need.</p>, <p>Every major economy needs to enhance its Paris targets, in my view, to a level that will keep our goal within reach. And then—and then—continue to raise our standards. Developing economies need to take meaningful mitigation adaptation actions as well, but they're going to need help. Our success, in my view, hinges on our collective commitment to ramping up our momentum and strengthening our climate ambition. I—advancing concrete actions during this decade to keep the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal within our reach and be realistic.</p>, <p>Developed and developing economies, so many of which are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, have to stand together and hold each other accountable. The United States recognizes that we will meet our duty to support developing countries taking these actions because they're going to need our help.</p>, <p>At the U.S.—at the U.N. General Assembly, I announced our intention to work with our Congress to quadruple our climate financing by 2024, including support for adaptation. As I said earlier, we'll also make our first-ever contributions to the Adaptation Fund.</p>, <p>And I guess I shouldn't apologize, but I do apologize for the fact the United States, in the last administration, pulled out of the Paris accords and put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit. That was the first thing I did when elected. And I see my friend nodding his head over there, because we talked about this before, while I was running.</p>, <p>But today I'm announcing also the Presidential Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience. And although I try to—very hard to resist acronyms, they came up with that because—so they could say, ""PREPARE."" [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what we're calling it. But PREPARE will serve as a comprehensive framework to mobilize U.S. Government resources and expertise in support of climate adaptation efforts for more than a half a billion people worldwide.</p>, <p>We're going to invest in creating an early warning system and expanding clean energy; and build a WaterSMART infrastructure for drought, supporting sustainable forestry and agriculture; and helping nature to work to reduce the climate change drivers and impacts; and protecting critical infrastructure, enhancing resilience of vulnerable nations in the face of a wide range of climate impacts.</p>, <p>If we had more time, I'd go into detail of what are the things we think we can do to do those things. But you know, we're also launching a net-zero world initiative to help share the technical expertise of the United States world-class national laboratories—and the speed and support to transition of—for developing countries to energy systems that are affordable and reliable and clean.</p>, <p>And here's what we should all remember, in my view—presumptuous of me to say this, what we should all remember—but I think we should: We have to make sure that our people understand, making these investments in our clean energy future isn't just the need to fight climate change. As I said a moment ago—and I apologize for repeating myself—when I spoke to the whole assembly is that it's an enormous opportunity—an enormous opportunity to create good-paying jobs for our own workers today and to spur long-term economic growth that's going to improve the quality of life for all people. I think that really is within our power to do it if we make the commitment.</p>, <p>These are investments that we can't afford to not make. And we all have to step up, as—to use the vernacular, English vernacular—step up to the plate and do our piece. I—we really mean it. And you know, these investments, as I said, are ones that I think we can meet.</p>, <p>Our meeting here in Glasgow isn't the end of the journey, as we all know. And I know we all know this, and you know it as well or better than I do, many of you. It's really just a starting line to begin to really take, for the first time, really decisive action and one that's going to determine whether or not we're going to be able to meet the challenge of climate change and deliver on the promise of a safer, more prosperous future for all our people.</p>, <p>I think we can do this. My mother, God love her, used to have an expression. She'd say, ""Out of everything bad, something good will come if you look hard enough for it."" Well, I know, in the United States, just because of the leadership of people behind me—like former Secretary Kerry and Senator Kerry, and a lot of you as well—that the American people 4 or 5 years ago weren't at all sure about climate change, whether it was real.</p>, <p>Well, they have, as they say in southern parts of my State, seen the Lord. They've seen what's happened back home, the incredible changes that are taking place. And they're now finally—finally, finally—realizing the sense of urgency that you all are.</p>, <p>And so, look, as I said, we have the tools, and I think we have the know-how, and we have the resources. But we have to make some just—we have to make some choices. And I apologize that I have to—going to have to step away. One of the choices I'm going to make is, I'm going to better the person sitting in this seat in a moment and ask Secretary Kerry, the Special Presidential Envoy on Climate Change and a longtime friend and a genuine expert on this issue. We—he's done an incredible job this year.</p>, <p>But let me conclude by saying—and I know I've gone over my time—is that I really, honest to God, think we have an opportunity if we seize it, an opportunity that I think the world is ready to embrace.</p>, <p>But I want to emphasize again: I think those of us who have deforested a long time ago, those of us who have taken actions a long time ago that caused the problems we have, we have to be ready to step up for everyone from Tanzania to Fiji to make sure that they have the wherewithal.</p>, <p>And we had—that's the next—I have to acknowledge to you: That's the next big case that I'm going to have to make at home. They now know there is a climate change, and they're ready to step up. But we've got to make sure they know that the United States has an obligation to also step up at financing, financing other countries that are—have not had the opportunity to do as much damage as we have and have an opportunity to get much better.</p>, <p>So, anyway, thank you very much. And thank you for having me, old buddy. Appreciate it.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> Thank you very much. Thank you, Joe.</p>]"
4,6,Joseph R.

It's simple: Will we act? Will we do what is necessary? Will we seize the enormous opportunity before us? Or will we condemn future generations to suffer?</p>, <p>This is the decade that will determine the answer. This decade. The science is clear: We only have a brief window left before us to raise our ambitions and to raise—to meet the task that's rapidly narrowing.</p>, <p>This is the decisive decade in which we have an opportunity to prove ourselves. We can keep the goal of limiting global warming to just 1.5 degrees Celsius within our reach if we come together, if we commit to doing our part of each of our nations with determination and with ambition. That's what COP26 is all about.</p>, <p>Glasgow must be the kickoff of a decade—a decade of ambition and innovation to preserve our shared future. Climate change is already ravaging the world. We've heard from many speakers. It's not a hypothetical; it's not a hypothetical threat. It's destroying people's lives and livelihoods and doing it every single day.</p>, <p>It's costing our nations trillions of dollars: record heat and drought fueling more widespread and more intense wildfires in some places and crop failures in others. Record flooding and what used to be a once-in-a-century storms are now happening every few years.</p>, <p>In the past few months, the United States has experienced all of this, and every region of the world can tell similar stories. And in an age where this pandemic has made so painfully clear that no nation can wall its all—wall itself off from borderless threats, we know that none of us can escape the worse that's yet to come if we fail to seize this moment.</p>, <p>But, ladies and gentlemen, within the growing catastrophe, I believe there's an incredible opportunity, not just for the United States, but for all of us. We're standing at an inflection point in world history. We have the ability to invest in ourselves and build an equitable clean energy future and in the process create millions of good-paying jobs and opportunities around the world: cleaner air for our children, more bountiful oceans, healthier forests and ecosystems for our planet.</p>, <p>We can create an environment that raises the standard of living around the world. And this is a moral imperative, but it's also an economic imperative—if we fuel greater growth, new jobs, better opportunities for all our people. And as we see current volatility in energy prices, rather than cast it as a reason to back off our clean energy goals, we must view it as a call to action.</p>, <p>High energy prices only reinforce the urgent need to diversify sources, double down on clean energy development, and adapt promising new clean energy technologies so we can not only—we don't remain overly reliant on one source of power to power our economies and our communities.</p>, <p>It's in the self-interest of every single nation. And this is a chance, in my view, to make a generational investment in our economic resilience and in our workers and our communities throughout the world. That's what we're going to do in the United States.</p>, <p>My Build Back Better framework will make historic investments in clean energy, the most significant investment to deal with the climate crisis that any advanced nation has made ever. We're going to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by well over a gigaton by 2030, while making it more affordable for consumers to save on their own energy bills with tax credits for things like installing solar panels, weatherizing their homes, lowering energy prices. We'll also deliver cleaner air and water for our children, electrifying fleets of school buses, increasing credits for electric vehicles, and addressing legacy pollution.</p>, <p>It will incentivize clean energy manufacturing, building the solar panels and the wind turbines that are growing energy markets of the future, which will create good-paying union jobs for American workers—and something that none of us should lose sight of.</p>, <p>When I talk to the American people about climate change, I tell them it's about jobs. It's about workers who will lay thousands of miles of transmission lines of a clean, modern, resilient power grid; the autoworkers who will build the next generation of electric vehicles and electricians who will install a nationwide network of 500,000 vehicle stations to power them throughout my country; the engineers who will design new carbon capture systems, and the construction workers who will make them a reality; the farmers who will not only help fight global hunger, but also use the soil to fight climate change; the communities that will revitalize themselves around new industries and opportunities.</p>, <p>And because we are taking all these actions, the United States will be able to meet the ambitious target I set in the Leaders' Summit on Climate back in April, reducing the U.S. emissions by 50 to 52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.</p>, <p>We'll demonstrate to the world the United States is not only back at the table, but hopefully, leading by the power of our example. I know it hasn't been the case, and that's why my administration is working overtime to show that our climate commitment is action, not words.</p>, <p>On my very first day in office, I took action to return the United States to the Paris Agreement. Since then, our administration has been hard at work unlocking clean energy breakthroughs to drive down the cost of technologies that will require us to do—to achieve net-zero emissions and working with the private sector on the next generation of technologies that will power a clean economy of the future.</p>, <p>Over the next several days, the United States will be announcing new initiatives that demonstrate our commitment to providing innovative solutions across multiple sectors, from agriculture to oil and gas, to combating deforestation, to tackling hard and to abate industries. We're planning for a both short-term sprint to 2030 that will keep 1.5 degrees Celsius in reach and for a marathon that will take us to the finish line and transform the largest economy in the world into a thriving, innovative, equitable, and just clean-energy engine of net-zero—for a net-zero world.</p>, <p>That's why today I'm releasing the U.S. long-term strategy, which presents a vision of achieving the United States goal of net-zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050 and reinforces an absolutely critical nature of taking bold action with the—in the decisive decade.</p>, <p>We're also going to try to do our part when it comes to helping the rest of the world take action as well. We want to do more to help countries around the world, especially developing countries, accelerate their clean energy transition, address pollution, and ensure the world we all must share a cleaner, safer, healthiest planet. And we have an obligation to help.</p>, <p>And the United Nations—at the United Nations in September, I announced that my administration is working with the Congress to quadruple our climate finance support for developing countries by 2024, including a significant increase in support for adaptation efforts. This commitment has made possible to each of our collective goals of mobilizing $100 billion annually for climate finance.</p>, <p>But mobilizing finance at the scale necessary to meet the incredible need is an all-hands-on-deck effort. As other speakers today have mentioned, governments and the private sector and multilateral development banks must also do their work to go from millions to billions to trillions—the necessary effect of this transition. Today I'm also submitting a new Adaptation Communication laying out how we will implement the global goal of adaptation, as well as announcing our first-ever contribution to the Adaptation Fund.</p>, <p>But our commitment is about more than just financing; that's a critical piece of it. We're also going to support solutions across the board. In the leadup to this gathering, the United States joined our G-7 partners to launch a Build Back Better World Initiative. We also reconvened the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate to launch transformative actions and to raise ambition.</p>, <p>And together with the European Union, we are launching a Global Methane Pledge to collectively reduce methane emissions—one of the most potent greenhouse gases—by at least 30 percent by the end of the decade. More than 70 countries have already signed up to support rapid reduction of methane pollution, and I encourage every nation to sign on. It's the simple [single]* most effective strategy we have to slow global warming in the near term.</p>, <p>My friends, if we are to recognize that a better, more hopeful future of—every nation has to do its part with ambitious targets to keep 1.5 degrees in reach and specific plans of how to get there, especially the major economies. It's imperative that we support developing nations so they can be our partners in this effort. Right now we're still falling short. There's no more time to hang back or sit on the fence or argue amongst ourselves.</p>, <p>This is the challenge of our collective lifetimes, the existential threat to human existence as we know it. And every day we delay, the cost of inaction increases. So let this be the moment that we answer history's call here in Glasgow. Let this be the start of a decade of transformative action that preserves our planet and raises the quality of life for people everywhere.</p>, <p>We can do this. We just have to make a choice to do it. So let's get to work. And thank you.</p>, <p>Those of us who are responsible for much of the deforestation and all the problems we have so far have an overwhelming obligations to the nations who, in fact, were not there, have not done it. And we have to help much more than we have thus far.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and may God save the planet. Thank you.</p>]"
4,7,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks at the Global Summit on Supply Chain Resilience in Rome, Italy",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-global-summit-supply-chain-resilience-rome-italy,"[<p>Thank you all for joining us today. I think the Prime Minister may be still occupied in another part of the building, so we're going to begin.</p>, <p>We're going to bring our shared attention to the vital issue that is impacting on all of our countries: supply chain disruptions. Supply chains are something that most of our citizens never think twice about until something goes wrong. And during this pandemic, we've seen delays and backlogs of goods, from automobiles to electronics, from shoes to furniture.</p>, <p>Ending the pandemic is the ultimate key to unlocking the disruptions we're all contending with. But we have to take action now, together with our partners in the private sector, to reduce the backlogs that we're facing. And then we have to prevent this from happening again in the future.</p>, <p>Now that we have seen how vulnerable these lines of global commerce can be, we cannot go back to business as usual. This pandemic won't be the last global health crisis we face. We also need to increase our resilience in the face of climate change, natural disasters, and even planned attacks.</p>, <p>Many of our supply chains are almost entirely owned and operated by the private sector. But government can play a key role identifying supply chain risks and bringing the different pieces and actors together to address these vulnerabilities.</p>, <p>In the United States, my administration has focused on this from our earliest days of the administration, which is not that long ago—[<i>laughter</i>]—just January 20 of this year. In February, we began directing new investments to strengthen supply chains at home and to work with partners to bolster supply chains around the world.</p>, <p>Last month, we launched an early warning system to help get ahead of the global supply chain disruptions from—for computer chips, which impacts so many industries in my country and all of yours.</p>, <p>Just a few weeks ago, we were able to facilitate an agreement with key unions, retailers, and freight movers to begin operating two of the largest ports in the United States that account for 40 percent of the imports on the West Coast: the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach, California. So we got them to move from 5 days a week, 8 hours a day, to 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.</p>, <p>I'm going to help get—it's going to help get goods on the shelves faster. And our Build Back Better framework provides, for the first time, funding dedicated to monitoring and strengthening supply chains.</p>, <p>Today I'm announcing two further steps: First, I'm allocating additional funding to help American partners, as well as the United States, cut port congestion by slashing redtape and reducing processing times so that ships can get in and out of our ports faster.</p>, <p>And second, I'm signing an Executive order that will strengthen our management of the United States defense stockpiles for minerals and materials. It will allow us to react and respond more quickly to shortfalls in the industrial base.</p>, <p>I urge all of you—all of you—to consider bolstering your stockpiles critical to national security in your countries. But like so many challenges today, it isn't a problem any one of our nations can solve through unilateral actions. Coordination is the key, the reason for this meeting. The best way to reduce current delays and build in greater resilience for the future is to work together across the entire supply chain, from raw materials to warehousing and distribution.</p>, <p>Our supply chain should be: one, diversified, so that we're not dependent on any one single source that might cause a failure; secure—secure against natural and manmade threats, including cyber and criminal attacks, like ransomware; and transparent so that both government and the private sector can better anticipate and respond to shortages that may be coming down the pike; and sustainable, to ensure our supply chains are free from forced and child labor, supporting the dignity and the voice of workers and are in line with our climate goals.</p>, <p>Because, at the end of the day, supply chain resilience is really about all of our people, the workers around the world who make the flow of goods possible: factory workers, dockworkers, welders, shipping crews, truckers, childcare providers, locomotives, so many other pieces.</p>, <p>Solving this is going to take all of us: government and private industry, labor unions and research institutions. So I'm directing my Secretary of State—Secretaries of State and Commerce to chair a multistakeholder forum in the beginning of next year to bring all these key parties together with relevant officials from all of our governments to chart a path forward.</p>, <p>I look forward to hearing from each of you and finding ways we can work together to increase our resilience and enhance our shared prosperity.</p>, <p>Now I'm going to turn it over to Secretary Blinken to actually make sure the trains run on time here.</p>]"
4,8,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks With President Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission on the United States-European Union Agreement on Steel and Aluminum Trade in Rome, Italy",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-with-president-ursula-von-der-leyen-the-european-commission-the-united-states,"[<p><i>President Biden.</i> Good afternoon, everyone. As you know, I'll be holding a press conference later today, and—when I look forward to taking your questions. But right now I'm not going to take any questions. I'm going to head back down to the meeting downstairs, but I will be able to take your questions later today.</p>, <p>Right now I'm here with the European Commission President von der Leyen, who's been a great partner, because the United States and the European Union have reached a major breakthrough that will address the existential threat of climate change while also protecting American jobs and American industry.</p>, <p>Together, the United States and the European Union are ushering in a new era of transatlantic cooperation that's going to benefit all of our people, both now and, I believe, in the years to come. And it's a testament to the power of our strong partnership and to what the United States can accomplish by working together with our friends.</p>, <p>Here's what this deal does: It immediately removes tariffs on European Union—on the European Union, on a range of U.S. products and lowers cost to American consumers. It ensures a strong and competitive U.S. steel industry for decades to come and creates good-paying union jobs at home and—and—demonstrates how by harnessing our diplomatic and economic power, we can reject the false idea that we can't grow our economy and support American workers while tackling the climate crisis; we can do all three of those things. We can and we must do both.</p>, <p>The American workers are a central part of the solution to the climate crisis. And I would argue—I've said before, or—that when I think climate, I think jobs; I think of good-paying jobs around the world. You know, I think it's possible for us to do both, as I said. And the workers are a central part of this solution.</p>, <p>Building on our close partnership on our shared values, the United States and the European Union have committed to negotiate a carbon-based arrangement on steel and aluminum trade. This—these arrangements will, one, lift up U.S. aluminum and steel, which is among the greatest steel in the world—that's somewhat prejudiced on my behalf; incentivize emission reductions in one of the most carbon-intense sectors of the global economy; restrict access to our markets for dirty steel from countries like China; and counter countries that dump steel in our markets, hammering our workers and harming them badly along with the industry and our environment.</p>, <p>Today is a testament of the power of American diplomacy and strong partnerships to deliver tangible benefits for American workers and the middle class families in America.</p>, <p>I thank Gina Raimondo and—our Secretary—and Ambassador Katherine Tai for their leadership to get this done. But they had a really first-rate person to work with to get it done. And I want to thank the European Commission President von der Leyen for her team and her partnership. She's been straightforward from the very beginning as we worked to come up with a creative solution that benefits all of our people.</p>, <p>Over the past 9 months, the United States and the European Union have come together to take on major global challenges by looking to all that unites us and the shared interests we have both in Europe and the United States. We resolved the 17-year Boeing-Airbus dispute. And we've been close partners to the—to address COVID-19 and combat climate change.</p>, <p>As we move forward, we're going to continue together to update the rules of the road and the 21st-century economy, and prove to the world that democracies—democracies—are taking on hard problems and delivering sound solutions. And the European Union and the United States will continue to be the closest of friends and partners as we work together to solve the 21st-century challenges.</p>, <p>So I thank you again, President von der Leyen. And now I turn the podium over to you. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>President von der Leyen.</i> Thanks a lot.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> I think I'm over there.</p>, <p><i>President von der Leyen.</i> Thank you very much, Mr. President, dear Joe. Thank you very much.</p>, <p>And I'm also very pleased to announce that, Mr. President, you and I, we have today agreed to suspend the tariffs on steel and aluminum and to start the work on the new Global Sustainable Steel Arrangement. And this marks a milestone in the renewed EU-U.S. partnership. And it is our global first in our efforts to achieve the decarbonization of the global steel production and trade.</p>, <p>It is a big step forward in fighting climate change. The arrangement is, of course, open to all likeminded partners. Steel manufacturing is one of the highest carbon emission sources globally. And for steel consumption and trade to be sustainable, we must address the carbon intensity of the industry. We must also address problems of overcapacity.</p>, <p>And this is what the Global Sustainable Steel Arrangement is all about. We will work together with the United States to ensure the long-term viability of our industry and to encourage the production and trade of low-carbon steel.</p>, <p>This new global initiative will add a new powerful tool in our quest for sustainability. It will be a major step forward in achieving climate neutrality. And it will ensure a level playing field for our industries.</p>, <p>It is yet another key initiative for our renewed, forward-looking transatlantic agenda with the United States. Since the beginning of the year—as you said, Mr. President, dear Joe—we have restored trust and communication. We put to rest our disputes on aircraft subsidies. We set up our Trade and Technology Council. We created a vaccine partnership. We reached an agreement on global minimum tax. And now we have found a solution on EU-U.S. steel and aluminum trade.</p>, <p>I thank you, Mr. President, dear Joe, for your announcement that the United States will remove U.S. tariffs on EU steel and aluminum up to previous trade levels. This will alleviate a major part of the existing trade irritants. It will allow trade to—transatlantic trade in steel and aluminum between us to come back to the levels recorded before these tariffs were put in place. And following this U.S. decision, I am pleased to announce that the Commission will also propose to suspend the tariffs that we had introduced.</p>, <p>I'm also pleased to join President Biden in announcing the pausing of our dispute on this issue in the World Trade Organization.</p>, <p>And as you did, Mr. President, dear Joe, I would like to thank Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Katherine Tai, and Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis for their and their team's tireless efforts in the last month.</p>, <p>This is a major step forward in our renewed relationship, and many thanks for that. Looking forward to working more on this deal.</p>, <p>Thanks a lot.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p><i>President von der Leyen.</i> Thank you very much.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Thank you, folks.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> How soon will it——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Why did it take so long?</p>]"

I'm very pleased to have the chance to host President Biden at Villa Bonaparte. And thank you very much for coming.</p>, <p>I believe that for the two discussions in September and in October, this is an important meeting because for the—[<i>inaudible</i>]—AUKUS issue, we very much launched a joint—some joint work and a strengthened cooperation and political—[<i>inaudible</i>].</p>, <p>The work undertaken over the past few weeks and what we will be talking about today, first and foremost, enables to clarify—and that was much needed—what is European sovereignty and European defense in itself—what it brings to global security. And together, we very much want to strengthen this cooperation, the strategic partnership between NATO and the European Union. We're both members of NATO, of course.</p>, <p>As to the importance of our discussion, we also want to underscore the importance of the cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region and our willingness to cooperate in this region.</p>, <p>Thirdly, and in this respect, I very much would like to thank President Biden for the decisions he already took. It is about our coordination in the fight against terrorism and, in particular, the presence of France in the Sahel, together with many of our European and international partners. And, over the past few weeks, President Biden took some fundamental decisions, which benefited to our armies. And these are very much the—this is the embodiment of the support he expressed.</p>, <p>Then, we acknowledged some bilateral partnerships on armament exportations, the nuclear sector, the space industry, and, of course, the most advanced technology. And we want to have some extended cooperation on regulations, as well.</p>, <p>And then we will continue to work together on the main international issues—climate change, the digital sector, health—which will be on the agenda of this G-20. And we will also upgrade our discussions on arms control, which remains a key issue.</p>, <p>In a few words, this is what was at the heart of our work over the past few weeks, what we will be discussing today. These are very concrete decisions that are being taken to support some initiatives, some joint initiatives, joint actions on all of these matters. And, for me, this is very much the beginning of a process of trust, of confidence, which we're building together.</p>, <p>Thank you very much, President, for the work undertaken over the past few weeks and for your presence here today.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Well, let me state the obvious: We have no older or no more loyal, no more decent ally than France. It's been—you've been with us from the beginning. You're the reason, in part, why we became an independent country.</p>, <p>As a matter of fact—we're trying to run this down, but my father always told me, and I have a little medallion—I've not followed up—that my name is ""Robinette""—my middle name. The—some of our French relatives came, I'm told, with—over—with Lafayette and didn't go home.</p>, <p>And so, all kidding aside, there's a strong affection, a sense of loyalty and commitment to France. And there is no place in the world where we can't work together and cooperate.</p>, <p>France is value added no matter where it is, and that's how we view it. And so—you know, whether it's the Sahel, where we're working together and you're carrying the burden on dealing with terrorism in that part of the world, or our attitude toward what happens in other areas, from our partnership when we were in Afghanistan together to today.</p>, <p>And so I want to get something clear in front of all the press: We view you as incredibly valuable, serious partners. Article 5 means everything to us. You were there for us; we'll be there for you. There's a lot more work we can do together, guaranteed.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, President Macron spoke in English as follows.</i>]</p>, <p><i>President Macron.</i> Thank you, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> No, no—don't thank me. Thank you. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>France-U.S. Relations/U.S.-Australia Nuclear Submarine Agreement </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Is the relationship repaired?</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> You're asking me? [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Yes.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Well, the answer is: I think what happened was—to use an English phrase, what we did was ""clumsy."" It was not done with a lot of grace. I was under the impression certain things had happened that hadn't happened.</p>, <p>And—but I want to make it clear: France is an extremely, extremely valued partner—extremely—and a power in and of itself.</p>, <p>And so I don't know any reason that—we have the same values.</p>, <p><i>Cancellation of French-Australian Military Contract/France-U.S. Relations </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>What did you think had happened that had not happened?</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> I was under the impression that France had been informed long before that the deal was not going through. I, honest to God, did not know you had not been.</p>, <p>But having said that, look, there's too much we have done together, suffered together, celebrated together, and valued together for anything to really break this up.</p>, <p>And the world—look, we're at one of those inflection points in world history; things are changing, the pieces on the board are moving. And it happens every some 50 to 75 years. It's happening. And I want to be on the same board that France is on.</p>, <p>[<i>Several reporters began speaking at once.</i>]</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>President Macron, what is your response to what President Biden just said?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>President Macron, are you satisfied that the relationship is repaired?</p>, <p>[<i>President Macron spoke in English as follows.</i>]<i> </i></p>, <p><i>President Macron.</i> I think we clarified a lot of things.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Hold on. He's speaking.</p>, <p><i>President Macron.</i> I think we clarified what we——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Say that again, sir?</p>, <p><i>President Macron.</i> We clarified together what we had to clarify. The U.S. was not the only party at stake, as the President just said. And now what's important is precisely to be sure that such a situation will not be possible for our future. Stronger coordination, stronger cooperation.</p>, <p>But, for me, what's important is that we built, during the past weeks, some very concrete actions in order to strengthen the partnership in the Sahel. This clarification between what European defense means and how this is completely compatible with NATO, what European sovereignty means and how it is important for global security. And this is, for me, an important clarification. Plus, we launched a series of cooperations, as I mentioned.</p>, <p>So, for me, what really matters now is what we will do together in the coming weeks, the coming months, the coming years.</p>]"

5,1,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on Infrastructure and Jobs and Education and Family Assistance Legislation,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-infrastructure-and-jobs-and-education-and-family-assistance-legislation,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good morning. Today I am pleased to announce that after months of tough and thoughtful negotiations, I think we have a historic—I know we have a historic economic framework.</p>, <p>It's a framework that will create millions of jobs, grow the economy, invest in our Nation and our people, turn the climate crisis into an opportunity, and put us on a path not only to compete, but to win the economic competition for the 21st century against China and every other major country in the world.</p>, <p>It's fiscally responsible. It's fully paid for. Seventeen Nobel Prize winners in economics have said it will lower the inflationary pressures on the economy. And, over the next 10 years, it will not add to the deficit at all; it will actually reduce the deficit, according to the economists.</p>, <p>I want to thank my colleagues in the Congress for their leadership. We've spent hours and hours and hours over months and months working on this.</p>, <p>No one got everything they wanted, including me, but that's what compromise is. That's consensus. And that's what I ran on. I've long said compromise and consensus are the only way to get big things done in a democracy, important things for the country.</p>, <p>I know it's hard. I know how deeply people feel about the things that they fight for. But this framework includes historic investments in our Nation and in our people. Any single element of this framework would fundamentally be viewed as a fundamental change in America. Taken together, they're truly consequential.</p>, <p>I'll have more to say after I return from the critical meetings in Europe this week. But for now, let me lay out a few points. First, we face—and I know—I apologize for saying this again: We face an inflection point as a nation. For most of the 20th century, we led the world by a significant margin because we invested in our people. Not only in our roads, in our highways, and our bridges, but in our people, in our families.</p>, <p>We didn't just build an Interstate Highway System, we built a highway to the sky. We invested to win the space race, and we won. We were also among the first to provide access to free education for all Americans, beginning back in the late 1800s.</p>, <p>That decision alone to invest in our children and their families was a major part of why we were able to lead the world for much of the 20th century.</p>, <p>But somewhere along the way, we stopped investing in ourselves, investing in our people. America is still the largest economy in the world. We still have the most productive workers and most innovative minds in the world. But we've risked losing our edge as a nation.</p>, <p>Our infrastructure used to be rated the best in the world. Today, according to the World Economic Forum, we rank 13th in the world.</p>, <p>We used to lead the world in educational achievement. Now, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ranks America 35th out of the 37 major countries when it comes to investing in early childhood education and care. And we know how our children start impacts significantly on how they'll finish.</p>, <p>We can't be competitive in the 21st century global economy if we continue to slide.</p>, <p>That's why I've said all along: We need to build America from the bottom up and the middle out, not from top down with the trickle-down economics that's always failed us. I can't think of a single time when the middle class has done well, but the wealthy haven't done very well. I can think of many times, including now, when the wealthy and the superwealthy do very well and the middle class don't do well.</p>, <p>That's why I proposed the investments Congress is now considering in two critical pieces of legislation: positions I ran on as President, positions I announced when I laid out in the Joint Session to Congress what my economic agenda was.</p>, <p>These are not about left versus right or moderate versus progressive or anything else that pits Americans against one another. This is about competitiveness versus complacency. Competitiveness versus complacency. It's about expanding opportunity, not opportunity denied. It's about leading the world or letting the world pass us by.</p>, <p>Today, with my Democratic colleagues, we have a framework for my Build Back Better initiative. And here's how it will fundamentally change the lives of millions of people for the better.</p>, <p>Millions of you are in the so-called ""sandwich generation,"" who feel financially squeezed by raising a child and caring for an aging parent. About 820,000 seniors in America and people with disabilities have applied for Medicaid—and they're on a waiting list right now—to get home care. They need some help. They don't have to be put—they don't have to be kicked out of their homes. But they need a little help getting around, having their meals made occasionally for them.</p>, <p>They don't want to put them in a nursing homes, not because of the cost, but because it's a matter of dignity. They want to stay in their homes. But it's hard. You're just looking for an answer so your parents can keep living independently with dignity. For millions of families in America, this—this issue—is the most important issue they're facing. It's personal.</p>, <p>So here's what we're going to do. We're going to expand services for seniors so families can get help from well-trained, well-paid professionals to help them take care of their parents at home: to cook a meal for them, to get their groceries for them, to help them get around, to help them live in their own home with the dignity they deserve to be afforded.</p>, <p>Quite frankly, what we found is that this is more popular or as popular as anything else we're proposing, because the American people understand the need. It's a matter of dignity and pride for our parents.</p>, <p>Thirty years ago, we ranked number seven among the advanced economies in the world as a share of women working. You know where we are today? We rank 23d. Twenty-third. Seven to twenty-three. Once again, our competitors are investing, and we're standing still.</p>, <p>Today, there are nearly 2 million women in America not working today simply because they can't afford childcare. A typical family spends about $11,000 a year on childcare. In some States, it's $14,500 a year per child. We're going to make sure nearly all families earning less than $300,000 a year will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for childcare. And for a family making $100,000 a year, that will save them more than $5,000 on childcare.</p>, <p>This is a fundamental game changer for families and for our economy as more parents, especially women, can get back to work and work in the workforce. I'm looking at a lot of significant press people in front of me. A lot of them are working—working mothers. They know what it costs.</p>, <p>I remember when I got to the Senate. I lost my wife and daughter in an accident. My two boys. I started commuting 250 miles a day because I had my mom and my dad and my brother and my sister to help me take care of my kids because I couldn't afford childcare, and I was getting a serious salary, $42,000 a year.</p>, <p>We've also extended the historic middle class tax cut—that's what I call it—middle class tax cut for parents. That is the expanded child tax credit we passed through the American Rescue Plan.</p>, <p>What that means is, for folks at home, they're getting $300 a month for every child under the age of 6, and $250 for every child under the age of 18. We're extending that for another year.</p>, <p>The money is already a life changer for so many working families. This will help cut child poverty in half this year, according to the experts.</p>, <p>But that's not all it does. It changes the whole dynamic for working parents. In the past, if you paid taxes and had a good income, you could deduct, under the Tax Code, $2,000 per child from the taxes you owed.</p>, <p>But how many families do you know—of cashiers, waiters, health care workers—who never got the benefit of that full tax break because they didn't have that much to deduct? And it wasn't refundable, so it either came off of your tax bill, or you didn't get full credit.</p>, <p>Why should somebody making $500,000 a year or $150,000 or $200,000 a year get to write it off their taxes? And the people who need the help even more, they don't have that much tax to pay; they don't get the benefit, and they have the same cost of raising their children.</p>, <p>Eighty percent of those left out were working parents who just didn't make enough money. That's why, in the American Rescue Plan, we didn't just expand the amount of the middle class tax cut, we also made it refundable. This framework will make it permanently refundable, making sure that the families who need it get a full credit for it, in addition to those who are already getting full credit.</p>, <p>They're going to make sure that every 3- and 4-year-old child in America will go to high-quality preschool. That's part of the legislation I just brought up to the Congress. Studies show that when we put 3- and 4-years-old in school—school, not daycare; school—we increase by up to 47 percent the chance that that child, no matter what their background, will be able to earn a college degree.</p>, <p>As my wife Jill, who's in the back here, always says: Any country that outeducates us is going to outcompete us. We can finally take us from 12 years to 14 years of universal education in America.</p>, <p>We also make investments in higher education by increasing Pell grants to help students from lower income families attend community colleges and 4-year schools. And we invest in historically Black universities—colleges and universities—HBCUs, minority-serving institutions, and Tribal colleges to make sure every young student has a shot at a good-paying job of the future.</p>, <p>This framework extends tax credits to lower premiums for folks on the—who are in the Affordable Care Act for another 3 years. For 4 million folks in the 12 States that haven't expanded Medicaid—all the rest have—this framework will enable you to get affordable coverage. And Medicare will now cover the cost of hearing aids and hearing checkups.</p>, <p>This framework also makes the most significant investment to deal with the climate crisis ever, ever happened, beyond any other advanced nation in the world. Over a billion metric tons of emissions reductions, at least 10 times bigger on climate than any bill that has ever passed before and enough to position us for a 50- to 52-percent emission reductions by the year 2030.</p>, <p>And we'll do it in ways that grow the domestic industries, create good-paying union jobs, and address longstanding environmental injustices as well. Tax credits to help people do things like weatherize their homes so they lose less energy, install solar panels and develop clean energy products, and help businesses produce more clean energy. And when paired with the bipartisan infrastructure bill, we will truly transform this Nation.</p>, <p>Historic investments in passenger rail. I know everybody says: ""Oh, Biden is a rail guy."" That's true. But passenger rail and freight rail and public transit—it's going to make hundreds of thousands—take hundreds of thousands of vehicles off the road, saving millions of barrels of oil. Everybody knows and all those studies show: If you can get from point A to point B on electric rail, you won't drive your car; you'll take the rail service.</p>, <p>We also learned that in most major cities in America, minority populations—the jobs they used to have in town, they're now out of town. Roughly 60 percent of the folks, they don't have vehicles, so they need to have a means to get out of town to their jobs, to be on time. That's what—this will do that, like it did for Detroit.</p>, <p>Ninety-five percent of the 840,000 [480,000]* school buses in America run on diesel. Every day, more than 25 million children and thousands of bus drivers breathe polluted air on the way to and from school from the diesel exhaust.</p>, <p>We're going to replace thousands of these with electric school buses that have big batteries underneath and that will—are good for the climate. I went down to the—one of the manufacturing facilities—saw them, got in one, drive them. They do not expend any—they do not expend any pollution into the air.</p>, <p>We'll build out the first-ever national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations all across the country. So, when you buy an electric vehicle, and you get credit for buying it—when you buy an electric vehicle, you can go all the way across America on a ""single tank of gas,"" figuratively speaking. It's not gas; you plug it in. Five hundred thousand of them, these stations along the way.</p>, <p>We're going to get off the sidelines on manufacturing solar panels and wind farms and electric vehicles with targeted manufacturing credits. You manufacture, you get a credit for doing it. These will help grow the supply chains in communities too often left behind. And we're going to reward countries for paying good wages—for companies, I should say—for good wages and for sourcing their materials from here in the United States.</p>, <p>That means tens of millions of panels and turbines, doubling the number of electric vehicles we have on the road within just 3 years. And we'll be able to sell and export these products and technologies to the rest of the world and creating thousands more jobs because we are, once again, going to be the innovators.</p>, <p>We'll also make historic investments in environmental cleanup and remediation. That means putting people to work in good-paying jobs at prevailing wage; capping hundreds of thousands—hundreds of thousands of abandoned wells and—gas wells—oil and gas wells that need to be capped because they are leaking things that hurt the air; putting a stop to the methane leaks in the pipelines; protecting the health of our communities. It's a big deal.</p>, <p>And we'll build up our resilience for the next superstorm, drought, wildfires, and hurricanes that represent a blinking ""code red"" for America and the world.</p>, <p>Last year alone, these types of extreme weather events you've all been covering and you've all witnessed, and you've—some of you have been caught in the middle of have caused $99 billion in damage to the United States within the last year—$99 billion. And we're not spending any money to deal with this? It's costing us significantly.</p>, <p>I met—in Pittsburgh, I met an IBEW electrical worker who climbs up on those powerlines in the middle of the storm to try to put transformers in to keep the lights on when the storms hit. He calls himself ""a hundred-percent union guy."" His job is dangerous.</p>, <p>As he said, and I quote, ""I don't want my kids growing up in a world where the threat of climate change hangs over their heads,"" end of quote. Folks, we all have that obligation—that obligation to our children and to our grandchildren.</p>, <p>The bipartisan infrastructure bill is also the most significant investment since we built the Interstate Highway System and won the space race decades ago.</p>, <p>This is about rebuilding the arteries of our economy. Across the country now, there are 45,000 bridges and 173 miles—thousand miles of roads are in poor condition. Some of the bridges you don't even take a chance of going across; they've shut down. They can't be built back to the same standard, because the weather is not going to get a lot better. We've just got to keep them from getting a heck of a lot worse. We have to build back better and stronger.</p>, <p>No one should have to hold their breath as they cross a rundown bridge or a dangerous intersection in their hometown. We're going to put hard-working Americans on the job to bring our infrastructure up to speed, good union jobs at prevailing wages. Jobs you can raise a family on and, as my dad would say, you can have a little ""breathing room.""</p>, <p>Jobs that can't be outsourced. Jobs replacing lead water pipes so families can drink clean water, improving the health of our children and putting plumbers and pipefitters to work. Jobs laying thousands of miles of transmission lines to build a modern energy grid. Jobs making high-speed internet affordable and available everywhere in rural and urban America, particularly including the 35 percent of rural America that currently goes without it right now.</p>, <p>This pandemic has made clear the need for affordable and available high-speed internet. The idea of a parent having to put their kids in the car for virtual learning, drive and sit in the McDonald's parking lot so that their child can access the internet when school is taught virtually is not only unnecessary, it's just wrong. It's wrong.</p>, <p>As I said before, these plans are fiscally responsible. They are fully paid for. They don't add a single penny to the deficit. And they don't raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. In fact, they reduce the deficit. Here's how:</p>, <p>I don't want to punish anyone's success. I'm a capitalist. I want everyone to be able to—if they want to be a millionaire or billionaire, to be able to seek their goal. But all I'm asking is: Pay your fair share. Pay your fair share. Pay your fair share. And right now many of them are paying virtually nothing.</p>, <p>Last year, the 55 most profitable corporations in America, 55 of them, paid zero—zero—in Federal income tax on about $40 billion in profit. If they report big profits to their shareholders, they should be paying taxes. It's that simple.</p>, <p>That's why the Build Back Better framework will have a 15-percent minimum on the largest corporations—a minimum tax of 15 percent. The top 1 percent of the wealthiest Americans evade, it's estimated by the experts, $160 billion a year in Federal taxes. That's wrong. We're going to change that.</p>, <p>I want to emphasize what I said from the beginning: Under my plans, if you earn less than $400,000 a year, you won't pay a single penny more in Federal taxes, period. In fact, these bills continue cutting taxes for middle class: for childcare, for health care, and so much more.</p>, <p>Let me close with this: For much too long, the working people of this Nation and the middle class of this country have been dealt out of the American deal, and it's time to deal them back in. I ran for President saying it was time to reduce the burden on the middle class, to rebuild the backbone of this Nation—working people and the middle class. I couldn't have been any clearer from the very moment I announced my candidacy.</p>, <p>That's why I wrote these bills in the first place and took them to the people. I campaigned on them. And the American people spoke.</p>, <p>This agenda—the agenda that's in these bills—is what 81 million Americans voted for. More people voted than at any time in American history. That's what they voted for. Their voices deserve to be heard, not denied—or worse, ignored.</p>, <p>Because here's what I know: If we make these investments, there will be no stopping the American people or America. We will own the future.</p>, <p>I have long said it's never been a good bet to bet against the American people—I've said that to foreign leaders as well as everybody here in this country, which means it's always a good bet to bet on the American people. Just give them half a chance. And that's what we're doing. That's what these plans do.</p>, <p>They're about betting on America, about believing in America, about believing in the capacity of the American people. If you look at the history of the journey of this Nation, what becomes crystal clear is this—I'll say it again—given half a chance, the American people have never, ever, ever, ever let the country down.</p>, <p>So let's get this done. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. And I'll see you in Italy and in Scotland. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Did Manchin and Sinema agree to this?</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, are you relying on——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Do you have a firm——</p>]"
5,2,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks at a Campaign Rally for Virginia Democratic Gubernatorial Candidate Terence R. McAuliffe in Arlington, Virginia",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-campaign-rally-for-virginia-democratic-gubernatorial-candidate-terence-r-0,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Hello, Virginia!</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> We love Joe! We love Joe! We love Joe!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Thank you. My name is Joe Biden. I'm Jill Biden's husband.</p>, <p>It's great to be with you all. I really mean that. First of all, it goes without saying how much I appreciate your current Governor, Ralph Northam. Where's Ralph? There you are, pal. Thank you. Well——</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Biden, Biden—[<i>inaudible</i>]! Biden, Biden—[<i>inaudible</i>]! Biden, Biden—[<i>inaudible</i>]!</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> We love Joe! We love Joe! We love Joe!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That's all right. Let them go. Let them go. That's okay. That's all right. Why don't you hang out and talk to me after this is over, okay?</p>, <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, thank you. Look—thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> We love Joe! We love Joe! We love Joe!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That's right. This is not a Trump rally. We let them holler. We let them holler.</p>, <p>I'd also like thank members of the congressional delegation that are here: Don Beyer—I think Don is here; Elaine Luria; Bobby Scott; Abigail Spanberger. Are they all over there? I don't—and Senator Tim Kaine and Jennifer Wexton. Folks, they've been critical in our efforts to make historic investments in our Nation and our people.</p>, <p>And of course, it's great to be here with Dorothy and Terry McAuliffe. Folks, it's time. It's time. One week to make those phone calls and knock on more doors. One week to get out the vote. And 1 more week to elect Terry McAuliffe your Governor of the State of Virginia.</p>, <p>You all know the stakes. And here are a few things I want you to remember. First, you don't have to wonder what kind of Governor Terry will be because you know what a great Governor he was. It wasn't just because of what he'd promised, it's what he delivered. On his watch, Virginia's economy boomed. Two hundred thousand jobs created. He made a record addition of $1 billion investment in education expanding preschool and resources for public schools in lower income communities and gave teachers a raise. Okay?</p>, <p>Now, I must say, parenthetically, the real reason I'm here tonight is, my wife Jill teaches full time at Northern Virginia Community College. And Terry's going to be her boss. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Look, Terry stood by our veterans, helping them apply their skills in good-paying civilian jobs in fields like cybersecurity and health care; funding for new veteran care centers, including the first one in the Hampton Roads region.</p>, <p>Look, he took on the gun lobby and enacted sensible gun safety measures without infringing on the Second Amendment, including helping keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.</p>, <p>Virginia, you know Terry. You know his record. He was a great Governor. If you reelect him again, he'll be another 4 years as a great Governor.</p>, <p>But look, how well do you know Terry's opponent?</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> No!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, just remember this: I ran against Donald Trump, and Terry is running against an acolyte of Donald Trump.</p>, <p>Terry's opponent doesn't like to talk about how—very much now—but to win the Republican nomination, he embraced Donald Trump. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> He started his campaign by saying the number-one issue in the race was—his called the election—he called for election integrity. Now, this guy starts, and he's calling for election integrity. Now, why did he do that? Because he wanted to hear Donald Trump? It was a price he'd have to pay for the nomination, and he paid it. But now he doesn't want to talk about Trump anymore.</p>, <p>Well, I do. Talk about an oxymoron: Donald Trump and election integrity? [<i>Laughter</i>] I can't believe he puts the words ""Trump"" and ""integrity"" in the same sentence. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Look, he's done a lot of lousy things. But when my friend General Colin Powell died, his integrity—a man of incredible integrity—they certainly go together with—""Colin Powell"" and ""integrity."" He's a decorated American hero, which is why the attack just leveled by Trump against General Powell was so offensive.</p>, <p>I'd say it's unbelievable, but it's not. Trump did the same thing about John McCain. That's who Donald Trump is. All coming from a guy who invented the ""big lie,"" drove a mob of insurrectionists to breach the Capitol on the 6th of January. And to this day, he incites people all around the country. He said—he said the people who attended his rally and then stormed the Capitol, quote: They ""were peaceful people,"" they ""were great people.""</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo!</p>, <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, God love you. I'm glad you're here.</p>, <p>Virginia, you know better. You saw it with your own eyes. Many of you were there. Some of you risked your lives. The anger. The rage. American flags turned into spears. A noose. A gallows. Police assaulted and killed. Death threats against elected officials and public servants carrying the most sacred act of a democracy: certifying a free election.</p>, <p>The breach of the Capitol; that didn't happen even during the Civil War. To Donald Trump, the insurrection isn't a violent assault that took place on January 6 at the Capitol. No. To Trump, the insurrection was the November 3 election when more Americans voted than had ever voted in all of our history. That's the ""big lie"" that Terry's opponent embraced.</p>, <p>And it prompted the Washington Post to write something about Terry's opponent that every Virginian should read before they vote, and I quote: ""Glenn Youngkin has failed [the] character test. . . . He . . . has indulged and encouraged Republicans who have swallowed former President Trump's lie that last year's Presidential election was stolen. . . . Mr. Youngkin chose to dignify a fundamental fiction that is subverting our system, rather than stand[ing] . . . squarely for the truth. In doing so, he proved himself unfit for office."" End of quote. I've not seen many editorials written that strongly in my career.</p>, <p>Heck, just look at how he's closing his campaign. He's gone from banning a woman's right to choose to banning books written by a Pulitzer Prize- and Nobel Prize-winning author, Toni Morrison.</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> My wife Jill went to Princeton to interview her, taught her book. Let's be clear: This is a guy who doesn't know much about anything.</p>, <p>A women's right to choose is very much at risk because of what's happening in Texas. If you want to protect a woman's right to choose in Virginia, you need a Governor absolutely committed to protecting that right. And Terry has made it clear he will be a ""brick wall"" against anyone trying to take that constitutional right away.</p>, <p>But Terry's opponent not only embraces someone with such a lack of character, he endorses Donald Trump's bad ideas and bad record. Donald Trump is the only President since Herbert Hoover in the thirties to see more jobs lost than gained the 4 years he was in office. In just 9 months of our administration, we've created more jobs than any President has in the same period of time in American history.</p>, <p>When Donald Trump left office, there were only about 2 million people fully vaccinated. In just 9 months in our first year, over 190 million Americans are now fully vaccinated.</p>, <p>Trump—I love this one—Trump likes to boast the single best measure of the economy is the stock market. I never thought that. Well, if that's true, take a look at the stock market now. It's higher than it's ever been. I guess it—[<i>inaudible</i>]—everything is doing well. It is. Higher than it's ever been.</p>, <p>Not only that, more people are working today than just before the pandemic started. Household wealth is up. People are buying more things. Manufacturing is up. We're on the move, but we're on the right track. We've got more to do.</p>, <p>So, if you're looking for someone who is going to keep your economy going and growing, the man behind me is the guy to get it done. He'll do it again.</p>, <p>In fact, we're taking a page from Terry's book when he was Governor and when he'd be Governor next time. We're emerging from this pandemic, and we want to expand pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds, millions of pre-K students. That's what's in my Build Back Better initiative. Studies show that when you do this, you increase by 58 percent the chances of a child—will complete the rest of their education in high school and beyond.</p>, <p>And what better—we want better roads, bridges, and airports. Well, take the new bridge that will be built next to the 117-year-old Long Bridge in Arlington. This will be a dedicated corridor to passenger rail and reduce traffic bottlenecks in freight rail. It will be a game changer.</p>, <p>Right now 13 percent of Virginia households don't have the internet. As we said during this pandemic, no parent should have to park in a McDonald's parking lot to have access to their internet for remote learning. Think about that. Terry wants every single Virginian to have access to affordable high-speed internet, and I guarantee we're going to both do that.</p>, <p>Right now there are 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and childcare centers in America that have lead pipes, including in their water. Look, folks, in America, every American, every child should be able to turn on a faucet and drink clean water.</p>, <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Give that guy a drink of water, will you? [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Look, let me ask you this. Why is it that, 20 years ago, a bottle of insulin for type 1 diabetes cost $32 a bottle, but today, the same exact—same exact—formula, no change, costs $280 a bottle?</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Hear me? That's not only wrong, it's immoral. Terry wants to take the drug companies—and I do—bring down the costs of prescription drugs. And we can do that.</p>, <p>There are nearly 2 million American—qualified women in America who are working—not working today because of childcare. Here in Virginia, the average two-parent home spends $14,600 a year for just one child. We want to bring those costs down so working families will not have to pay more than 7 percent of their income to care for a child under the age of 5.</p>, <p>We're going to raise the minimum wage to—Terry is going to—we strongly support it—to $15 an hour. No one—no one—working full-time should live below the poverty line.</p>, <p>And here's what else you ought to think about. Terry's opponent has made all of his private pledges of loyalty to Donald Trump. But what's really interesting to me: He won't stand next to Donald Trump now that the campaign's on. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Think about it. He won't allow Donald Trump to campaign for him in this State. And he's willing to pledge his loyalty to Trump in private. Why not in public? What's he trying to hide? Is there a problem with Trump being here? Is he embarrassed? Look at who has been here for Terry: my wife Jill, Barack Obama, Kamala Harris, Stacey Abrams, and so many more.</p>, <p>Look, let me close with this. There is a fundamental difference between Democrats and Terry McAuliffe and what's going on in today's Republican Party and Terry's opponent.</p>, <p>Number one, we stand for working people and the middle class. Trickle-down economics has never worked. We're both building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out. Today's Republican Party stands for nothing but just keep cutting taxes for the wealthy and the most powerful corporations.</p>, <p>Second thing to remember—here's the deal: Virginia Democrats, you've made incredible progress in this State in recent years on jobs, the economy, health care, education, on attracting new business, growing the middle class, and so much more. For more than 40 years in Virginia, it has been the Democrat and Democratic Governors who have led. You've made this progress because you've had the courage and the wisdom to reject the very extremism that has taken over the Republican Party all across America.</p>, <p>Think of it. The Republican Party, nationally, is for nothing. Not a joke. Nothing. Nothing. Just look around. Just look around—at what's happening with the Governor of Texas and Florida——</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> ——the assault on a woman's right to choose. The lives lost to this pandemic could have been saved. Virginia, for the sake of your families and the country, we can't let this happen here in Virginia.</p>, <p>Extremism can come in many forms.

5,3,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks at a United States-Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit Virtual Meeting,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-united-states-association-southeast-asian-nations-summit-virtual-meeting,"[<p>Well, thank you, Sultan, for bringing us together today. And I might say, it's good to see you again. We met when I was a United States Senator. You would—we've established a relationship, and it's good to see you looking well and running this meeting.</p>, <p>Brunei's leadership has been vital to seeing ASEAN through a very challenging year. It is my hope that in the future we'll be able to hold these meetings in person again, because the relationship between the United States and ASEAN is vital—vital—for the future of all 1 billion of our people.</p>, <p>Our partnership is essential in maintaining a free and open, which has been the foundation of our shared security and prosperity for many decades. And the United States strongly supports the ASEAN Outlook and the Indo-Pacific—on the Indo-Pacific and the rules-based regional order.</p>, <p>Our continued cooperation is only growing more important—not less—more important as we strive together to meet the challenges that are going to shape the 21st century moving forward: tackling COVID-19 pandemic, taking on the climate crisis, strengthening our cyber defenses, and producing new technologies, upholding freedom of the seas and commerce, and so much more. So much more.</p>, <p>So I'm looking forward to hearing from each of you and to our discussion today, but I want you all to hear directly from me the importance the United States places on our relationship with ASEAN. You can expect to see us showing up, as Vice President Harris did with her recent trip to the region. You can expect to see me personally showing up and reaching out to you.</p>, <p>You can expect to see the United States deepening our longstanding cooperation, pursuing new avenues of ministerial dialogue, investing in our countries, and driving inclusive prosperity in this critical region. In fact, we intend to launch a new program and initiatives to enhance our cooperation across the range of issues totaling more than $100 million.</p>, <p>Our bottom line is that ASEAN is essential—I want to say that it is essential—to the regional architecture of the Indo-Pacific. And the United States is committed to ASEAN's centrality. You know, it's a linchpin. It's a linchpin for maintaining the resilience, the prosperity, and security of our shared region.</p>, <p>And I want you to know I am truly looking forward to working with you to advance not only our many shared interests, but our shared values and shared vision for a region where every country can compete and succeed on a level playing field and all nations, no matter how big or powerful, abide by the law.</p>, <p>So I want to thank you all for this opportunity. And I look forward to this being the first of many meetings.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the meeting continued; no transcript was provided.</i>]</p>]"
5,4,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks in Kearny, New Jersey",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-kearny-new-jersey,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Hello, New Jersey! Thank you, Lieutenant Commander Mikie Sherrill. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Well, Governor Murphy, so many of the national challenges we're confronting are areas where you're already leading—and that's not hyperbole—and whether it's making health care or preschool or college more affordable; providing paid family leave; replacing lead in pipes; and protecting public health. So thanks for showing the way, pal. Thanks for showing the way.</p>, <p>It's also good to meet my old friends—a lot of my friends in Congress. But, Bill, you and I have been doing this a long time, pal. Thanks for the passport back into Jersey and your district.</p>, <p>And Josh Gottheimer has been the best go-between I've had trying to get all of this done, whether it's the Build Back Better for—portion or the infrastructure portion. And Tom Malinowski has done a hell of a job—and Don Payne and Frank Pallone.</p>, <p>I keep telling Frank, I remind him—we've been doing things together a long time: I know Delaware is small, I know how important New Jersey is, but Delaware owns the Delaware River up to the highwater mark in New Jersey. [<i>Laughter</i>] So you know what I mean? [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And one of my favorite Members of Congress, who I campaigned for and she won in spite of it: Mikie Sherrill—lieutenant commander of the United States Navy, a naval graduate, Georgetown Law. Incredible person.</p>, <p>And I want to acknowledge both Senators Booker and Menendez, who represent you so well in Washington. They're down there trying to get this all moving.</p>, <p>I'm here today to talk about what's fundamentally at stake for families of New Jersey, the whole region here, and for our country. For most of the 20th century, we led the world by a significant margin—not just led the world, by a significant margin—because we invested in ourselves, we invested in our people. Not only in our roads and our highways and our bridges, but in our people, in our families.</p>, <p>We were among the first to provide access to free education—12 years of free education for all—anyone who is an American—beginning back in the late 1800s and the early 1900s. And that decision to invest in our children and our families was a major part—a major part—of why we were able to lead the world for so much of the 20th century. But somewhere along the way, we took our eyes off the ball.</p>, <p>Our infrastructure used to be the best in the world. Not hyperbole—the best in the world. Today, according to the World Economic Forum, we rank 13th in the world. Twelve other nations have superior infrastructure to us, and China has trains that go 230 miles an hour for long distances. And we got money to do that back in the administration of Barack Obama and Joe Biden, and you had a Republican Governor who didn't want it, didn't want any parts of it.</p>, <p>And we used to lead the world in educational achievement. Now, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ranks America 35 out of 37 major countries when it comes to investing in early childhood education and care—35 out of 37. We cannot be competitive in the 21st-century global economy if we continue to slide.</p>, <p>My wife, who's a community college professor, says, ""Any nation that outeducates us will outcompete us."" I'll say it again: ""Any nation that outeducates us will outcompete us."" And that's a fact. That's why I resolved that we have to, once again, build America from the bottom up and the middle out.</p>, <p>I've never seen a time in American history when the middle class did well, the wealthy didn't do very well. But I'm tired of trickle-down. Trickle-down doesn't—hasn't worked so much for the last 15 years for working class and middle class folks.</p>, <p>That's why I proposed two critical pieces of legislation being debated back in Washington right now. These bills are not about left versus right or moderate versus progressive or anything else that pits an American—one American against one another.</p>, <p>These bills are about competitiveness versus complacency. Competitiveness versus complacency. They're about expanding opportunity, not opportunity denied. They're about leading the world or continuing to let the world pass us by.</p>, <p>First, the infrastructure bill. It's about rebuilding the arteries of America. And the Portal Bridge project is showing why investments like this are so important.</p>, <p>When the Portal Bridge was built, it was state of the art—and it really was, but 110 years ago. Today, it's been called something different: a ""chokepoint,"" a ""bottleneck,"" an ""Achilles heel"" of the Northeast Corridor.</p>, <p>Since the Portal Bridge was built, it has become the busiest rail span in the entire Western Hemisphere. Let me say that again: It's the busiest rail span in the entire Western Hemisphere. At peak usage, 450 trains pass over it every day; 200,000 Amtrak and New Jersey Transit passengers.</p>, <p>But ships and barges also need to get under it, and many can't fit. That means the bridges need to swing open and closed again, a process that stops rail traffic and causes other problems. The bridge opens over 100 times a year. And 15 percent of the time, something goes wrong. Fifteen percent of the time.</p>, <p>For example, if the rails don't lock back in place exactly right, the bridge closes. And sometimes, you know what fixes it in the 21st century? A sledgehammer. Come out with a sledgehammer and align the tracks. Literally a sledgehammer to knock it back into place in the year 2021.</p>, <p>One report, couple years ago, found that the Portal Bridge was particularly responsible for 2,000 hours of delays between 2014 and 2018. You know that old expression: ""Time is money."" As one commuter said, ""If you're on the train, and they say 'Portal Bridge,' you know you'd better make other plans.""</p>, <p>Aging infrastructure like this is more than an inconvenience or a nuisance, it's an impediment—an impediment—to America's global competitiveness. We're in a worldwide race. Things have changed. Take a look. That's why what's happening right now is so important.</p>, <p>Today, we're moving forward on a new bridge that will be higher over the water so it won't need to open and close. It will allow us to increase speed, safety, and efficiency, and capacity. It's going to make life a lot better for New Jersey's commuters. It's also going to create nearly 8,000 construction jobs in this area alone—this area's workers—8,000 union jobs. Union.</p>, <p>It was pointed out to me not long ago that I said I'm a ""union President,"" that I apparently use—someone calculated I use the word ""union"" more than the last seven Presidents combined. Because guess what? It's a decent wage. It's about to make rail transportation—which is a cleaner, greener way to travel—the better choice for a lot of New Jersey residents, but not just New Jersey, everybody up and down the East Coast.</p>, <p>If I can pause for a second—I apologize because some have heard this: I commuted every single day, 263 miles a day, on Amtrak from the time I got elected United States Senator. As matter of fact, when I was Vice President, I used to like to take the train home because my mom was very sick and dying, and I'd come home every weekend to make sure I'd take the train home. And Secret Service—and I'm not criticizing them—legitimately would rather me fly, because it's safer, because too many people can get on and off, et cetera.</p>, <p>And I'm getting on one Friday, and then one of the senior guys on Amtrak, Angelo Negri—I got to know all the conductors really well; they became my friends. I mean, really, my genuine friends. I have them in my home at Christmas and during the summer. And Ange walks up to me and goes, ""Joey, baby!"" Grabs my cheek. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I thought the Secret Service was going to blow his head off. [<i>Laughter</i>] I swear to God. True story. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>I said, ""No, no, he's a friend."" I said, ""What's up, Ange?"" He said, ""Joey, I read in the paper—I read in the paper you traveled 1,000—1,200,000 miles on Air Force planes""—because they keep meticulous tabs of it. I said, ""Yes?"" He said, ""Big""—I won't say the whole thing—""Big deal."" [<i>Laughter</i>] He said, ""You know how many miles you traveled on Amtrak, Joey?"" And I said, ""No."" He said, ""The boys and I figured it out at the retirement dinner."" He says, ""You traveled 2 million""—I think it was 180, but—""2,200,000 miles.""</p>, <p>I said, ""How did you get that answer?"" He said, ""Well, 267 miles a day. We figured you traveled 119 days a year for 36 years, and then you traveled as Vice President."" And he goes, ""So, Joey, I don't hear this about the Air Force anymore."" [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>I'm a train guy, because it also is the single most significant way we can deal with air pollution, the single most significant way we can deal with global warming. It's going to help the region's vital maritime industry as well, by making the movement of ships and bridges safer and more efficient.</p>, <p>Look, with my infrastructure bill, we're going to make sure projects like this are just the beginning. Across the country, there are 45,000 bridges in disrepair, some of them dangerously so; 173,000 miles of roads are in poor condition. We're going to create them totally new. We're going to fix them. This is going to be good union jobs, a prevailing wage you can raise a family on, jobs that can't be outsourced.</p>, <p>We're going to make the largest investment in public transportation in the history of America, replacing transit vehicles that are past their useful life and make the most significant investment in rail since the creation of Amtrak 50 years ago.</p>, <p>During peak periods when railroads are congested and rail carriers more—have more passengers, rail is up to 10 times more energy efficient than a person driving. Ten times. We have a huge opportunity here to provide fast, safe, reliable, and clean transportation in this country. All—every study shows—I won't bore you with them all because I've been working them my whole life—every study shows if you can get from point A to point B faster on rail and you can drive your automobile, you take the rail.</p>, <p>The Northeast Corridor—we're talking about a $30 billion investments in major projects like the Hudson River Gateway tunnels and the Portal Bridge, which it feeds into.</p>, <p>Look, we're going to create jobs replacing lead water pipes so families can drink clean water, something New Jersey and Governor Murphy have been leading on.</p>, <p>We're going to make sure high-speed internet is affordable and available everywhere in America, including the nearly one in three New Jersey families that don't have the internet subscription. How many times did you see people pulling up to McDonald's, sitting outside during the pandemic so they could do their homework because they couldn't get—get it off of their line?</p>, <p>We're going to create jobs laying thousands of miles of transmission lines to build modern, resilient—an energy grid. And we're going to invest in strengthening our infrastructure against the impacts of climate change.</p>, <p>The Gov and I were talking a little bit earlier. You know, just this year, we've—global warming has caused over $1 trillion—excuse me, $100 billion—$100 billion in damage. I visited New Jersey, as the Gov mentioned, after the Hurricane Ida came through. The Governor and several of you were with me.</p>, <p>In Manville, we met people who had been put out of their homes by flooding. It was devastating. Watermarks over people's heads. They'd show me where the water had gotten to. I told them that help was on the way.</p>, <p>Since then, FEMA processed assistance applications for nearly 30,000 New Jerseyans and approved $150 million in repairs, replacement, and rental assistance and other needs. Between 2010 and 2020, this State has had 24 extreme weather events—24. Nationally, extreme weather, as I said, cost the taxpayers $100 billion a year [last year].*</p>, <p>Our plan is going to build our roads higher, our levees stronger, our power grids more durable, all to withstand the ever-increasing ferocity and intensity of extreme weather. And with my Build Back Better plans, we're going to address the root cause of ever-increasing extreme weather and destruction. The climate crisis—we have a climate crisis.</p>, <p>I've flown all over this Nation this year, in helicopters, going from Lake Mead—you know, more land, Gov, has been burned to the ground in the West—to the ground: forest, homes—than the entire State of New Jersey, from all the way down to Cape May, all the way up to the Hudson. That's how much has burned to the ground.</p>, <p>My infrastructure bill will also put Americans to work for long-overdue national environmental cleanups, like cleaning up the Passaic River, the Nation's most expensive superfund site.</p>, <p>We're going to invest $42 billion in modernizing and electrifying our ports and airports—like the Port of New York and New Jersey, Newark Liberty International Airport—reducing congestion and emissions and creating thousands more good-paying union jobs.</p>, <p>This is going to help us meet the moment of the climate crisis in a way that creates good jobs, makes us more economically competitive, and we can breathe.</p>, <p>Look, we haven't passed the transformation—the transformative infrastructure bill for a decade. Think about this: How many times, under the former guy, did we have—we had ""Infrastructure Week""? Not a single thing happened. We need to get this done.</p>, <p>And it isn't enough just to invest in our physical infrastructure. We also have to invest in our people. That's what my second bill—the Build Back Better plan—does.</p>, <p>I just had the opportunity to visit a preschool in East End Elementary in North Plainfield. North Plain [Plainfield]* provides access to preschool for all kids four years and above. My plan is going to make it possible for the district to expand that program to 3-year-olds all across America. The earlier our children begin to learn, the better for themselves, their families, and for the Nation.</p>, <p>Studies show that children who have attended high-quality preschool are 50-percent more likely to finish high school and get a 2- or 4-year degree after high school. But right now we're lagging behind.</p>, <p>Today, only about half of 3- and 4-year-olds in America are enrolled in early education. In Germany, France, the U.K., and even Latvia, that number is over 90 percent. Over 90 percent of 3- and 4-year-olds are in school. My Build Back Better plan gets us back on track. And we'll make 2 years of high-quality preschool available to every child in America.</p>, <p>An average two-parent household in this State spends $15,000 to care for just one young child every year. Everybody says, ""How do you know?"" I know about this. When I got elected to the United States Senate, my wife and daughter were killed. I had two little boys. I was making a lot of money as a U.S. Senator—$42,000 a year—and I could not afford. That's why I started commuting every single day. Couldn't afford to have two houses and to have daycare. Thank God I have a sister, who's my best friend; a brother; my mother; and my father who helped out.</p>, <p>My Build Back Better plan is going to cut childcare costs more than in half for low- and middle-income New Jersey residents. Under my plan, no middle class family will spend more than 7 percent of their income on childcare.</p>, <p>We'll also extend historic middle class tax cuts for parents by expanding the childcare tax credit. Everybody talks about children. And Josh has heard me say it: I view it as a tax cut for middle class families—a tax cut. We never have an argument when we talk about the wealthy. This is a tax cut. It changes the lives of the American people. Because many people here in New Jersey understand it means you get $300 a month for every child under the age six and $250 for a child between 6 and 17.</p>, <p>That money is already a life-changer for so many working families. It's projected to cut child poverty in New Jersey by 36 percent. These bills are going to change the lives of millions of people in the area and hundreds of millions of people across the country for better and for years to come.</p>, <p>So, everyone here today, especially Governor Murphy and other dedicated officials here today, thank you for showing us what's possible. Because when we make these investments, there's going to be no stopping America. We will own the future.</p>, <p>This initiative is about betting on America, about believing in America, about believing in the American people. If you look at the history of the journey of this Nation, what becomes clear is this: Given half a chance, the American people have never, ever, ever let their country down.</p>, <p>So let's get this done. Let's move. Folks, we have the most—we have the most talented workforce in the world. What are we doing? What in God's name are we doing? And by the way, you hear these numbers—$3.5 trillion or $1.75 trillion. We pay for it all. It doesn't increase the deficit one single cent.</p>, <p>So let's get to work. Let's put people to work. And let's once again reestablish America as the most advanced country in the world.</p>, <p>God bless our—America, and God bless our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</p>]"

5,6,Joseph R.

How are you, sir? So there's a lot to get to tonight, and we've got a lot of great questions from our audience. We want to get into the details of what you're calling the Build Back Better plan.</p>, <p>Before we get into that though, I just want to know—there's been a lot of negotiating going on behind the scenes, as I'm sure you are very involved with. [<i>Laughter</i>] Are you close to a done deal?</p>, <p><i>The President's Legislative Agenda </i></p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No problems. It's all done. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>No, look, Anderson, we've been—I've probably spent, well, well over a hundred hours. This is a big deal. We're both have—we have two plans: one is the infrastructure plan—roads, highways, bridges, buses, trains, et cetera—and the other one is what I call the ""care economy"". It has a lot of money in there for environmental remediation as well as care economy. For example, you know, we want to get the economy moving, but millions of women can't go to work because they don't have any childcare. That kind of thing.</p>, <p>So there's a lot of pieces in there. There's a lot that people don't understand. And by the way, all of it's paid for, every single penny. It's not going to raise one single cent to the debt.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> We're going to get into a lot of those details. Just, though, are you close to a deal?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I think so. You know, look, I've been—I was a Senator for 370 years. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I was never—I was relatively good at putting together deals.</p>, <p><i>Gun Control Legislation </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Is this the toughest deal you've worked on?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No. No. I think banning assault weapons was the toughest deal I worked on—and succeeded.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> You're flying to Europe, I think, in 8 days.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President's Economic Plan/Bipartisanship </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Do you think you'll have a deal by the time you get on Air Force One in 8 days?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, look, you know, it's like my asking you, ""Are you sure your next show is going to be a success?"" Right? You know.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Yes. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, you're more confident than I am. [<i>Laughter</i>] Look—hey, look, it's all about compromise. You know, ""compromise"" has become a dirty word, but it's—bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible.</p>, <p>When I ran for the Presidency, I said I'm running for three reasons: one, to restore the soul and decency in the country; two, to build the middle class and the working class so they were—we build from the middle out; and three, to actually unite the country. And everybody has been saying: ""Well, that's crazy. You can't do it."" If we can't eventually unite this country, we're in deep trouble.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Bottom line: Do you think you will get a deal?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I do think I'll get a deal.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> All right, let's get some—let's go to the audience. This is Nicholas Vaught. He's the coordinator at the Applied Liberal Studies Program at Morgan State University. He's a Democrat.</p>, <p>Nicholas, your question.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Morgan State.</p>, <p><i>Child and Dependent Care Assistance/Child Tax Credit </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Morgan State.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> All right, man. I've spoken there.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Yes. So my wife and I have two young boys, Arthur and Teddy. However, the cost of childcare is nearly double our mortgage. We want to have more children, but even though we earn a good salary now, childcare is so expensive. So how will this new infrastructure plan help middle class families pay for childcare?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, let me ask you: Do you have—how old are your kids?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Three and a half and six months old.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> God love you. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Well, look, there's two pieces. There's the childcare—having someone take care of your child while you are working, while you and your wife are working. Under this proposal I have, no one will have to pay—unless you're making more than—individually, you're each making—making over 300 grand—$150,000 apiece.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>We're educators.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, good. [<i>Laughter</i>] And by the way, I'm married to one: Dr. Biden, right here.</p>, <p>So you will not have to pay more than 7 percent of your income for childcare—7 percent. And the way we do that is, we provide for the ability to have childcare centers funded. The money won't even go—you don't—the—figure your income; you get 7 percent with the total cost.</p>, <p>But there's another piece here: You now are qualified to be able to have a child tax credit. It used to be that when you—you know, when you—if you were—had enough money to pay significant taxes, you could write off 2,000 bucks for every child you had and reduce it from your taxes. But if you were making 60,000 bucks a year and you didn't have that much to write off, you didn't get anything.</p>, <p>Well, I call this a tax—break for middle-class people. If you're making in the $150,000 range right now, you're in a situation where you can get, if you have a child under 7, $350; if you have a child over 7, between 7 and 17, you can get $300. And you get a direct payment. You can—the IRS sends you money.</p>, <p><i>Child Tax Credit </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> The—Joe Manchin wants a work requirement with your enhanced tax credit for kids. Is that something you would support?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No. Here's the deal: All these people are working anyway.</p>, <p>And by the way, you know, why should somebody who is not working and has—you know, makes—has a million-dollar trust fund, why should they get the benefit, and someone making 60 grand and not working, but staying home, why should they not get anything? I don't get that.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> You're also proposing, for the first time ever, Federal paid parental leave. And——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. That's a different issue. Yes.</p>, <p><i>Paid Family Leave </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Right. A different issue. Right. But this is—but this is in your proposal. How much time off would parents actually get under your proposal? Because at one point, you talked about 12 weeks. Now there's reports it's down to maybe 4 weeks.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, it is down to 4 weeks. And the reason it's down to 4 weeks is, I can't get 12 weeks. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And—but look, here's the deal, guys: How many people do you know—not a joke—or maybe yourself—have had a circumstance where you are working like the devil, you're making 7 bucks an hour, 15 bucks an hour, or 20 bucks an hour, and you have a child that's sick at home—or you have a mother or a father, husband and wife, son or daughter, and you need to stay home to help them?</p>, <p>We're one of the few industrial countries in the world that doesn't have paid leave—so that when you stay home to help that person, to take care of that person, you're still getting your pay. And it does not hurt the business at all. The business isn't paying for it; the Federal Government is paying for it. It's a little bit like, as I said, a tax cut for people who are not able to otherwise take care of their families.</p>, <p>And look, I'm looking out here, and a lot of you are part of that sandwich generation: You have young kids, and you have aging parents. And one of the things all the polling data shows, Anderson, is people are more concerned about taking care of the elderly, because they don't know what to do, than they are even their children.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> I want to talk about this. I want you to meet Vanessa Antrum from Bowie, Maryland. She's retired. She's a caregiver for her elderly parents.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> God love you.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> She's a Democrat. Vanessa, your question.</p>, <p><i>Medicare and Medicaid/Homecare and Eldercare Assistance </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Yes. Mr. President, my parents have been married for 73 years and both are dealing—[<i>applause</i>]. Yes. Both of them are dealing with dementia. My father, who was a veteran, is completely bedridden, and my mom is experiencing issues with walking.</p>, <p>I have found the process for me to provide care for them in my home very hard. They have worked all their life only for me to experience a lot of redtape to provide supports——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Bingo.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>——in a loving home environment. What is being done to support the elderly, especially for a middle class family like mine?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, first of all—if my mom were here, she'd say you're a good daughter, number one.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Yes. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Number two, I was in a situation like you, where I was making more money—I was making $42,000 a year as a Senator at the time, although I was listed the poorest man in the Senate for 36 years, but—[<i>laughter</i>]—I still made more money than most people because Senate salaries kept going up.</p>, <p>What happened was, my dad got sick, and he was in hospice, so Jill and I took my dad home, and we took care of him in our house. But we were lucky because we had the ability to have—I have a sister who is an angel and a brother who's a wonderful guy, and we all took turns in our house taking care of them.</p>, <p>But here's the deal: Right now, under Medicaid, there are 860,000—I think it's 860—don't hold me to the exact number, but it's over 800,000—who qualify for home health care aid for their parents, but there's no money there. There's no money there.</p>, <p>So what we do is, we provide the funding for Medicaid to allow you to be able to keep—if your parents had their home—keeping them in their home if you wanted, or get help in your home with homecare from professionals providing—helping you take care of them—helping you take care of them.</p>, <p>And in many cases where you're not taking care of them in your own home and they're staying—and they're staying in their home, you're going to be able to have the ability to have someone come in and make their meals for them. They don't have to be there 24/7.</p>, <p>So there's a lot of things we're doing. In addition to the process, we're going to be able to train up those homecare workers who are usually minority women, women of color, as well as immigrants. And they have the capacity to learn more as they go along, to move to the point where they can become practical nurses and things like that.</p>, <p>So it's—it makes a lot of sense, and it's cheaper—cheaper—than it is to not do it.</p>, <p><i>Medicare and Medicaid Expansion Efforts/Senator Joseph A. Manchin III </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> One of the other things that Democrats are looking to do is to expand Medicare to include dental, vision, and hearing as well. Given all the negotiations that are going on, will all three of those still be covered?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That's a reach. And the reason why it's a reach—it's not—I think it's a good idea, and it's not that costly in relative terms, especially if we allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices.</p>, <p>But here's the thing: Mr. Manchin is—is opposed to that, as is—I think Senator Sinema is as well.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Opposed to all of them?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Opposed to all three. Because they don't want—he says he doesn't want to further burden Medicare so that—because it will run out of its ability to maintain itself in x number of years. There's ways to fix that, but he's not interested in that part either. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But look, Joe—Joe is not a bad guy. He's a friend. And he's always, at the end of the day, come around and voted for it.</p>, <p>But here's the point: We're in a situation now where if you are in a circumstance that you're not able to provide—let me cut to the chase; I'm taking too long. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>One of the things we were able to do in the meantime is—the most expensive of these things would be dental. Okay? Now, we're talking about—and I don't have a deal on it yet—maybe getting an $800 voucher from Medicare for dental work that you may need.</p>, <p>And the hearing is a very important thing because—as Kyrsten Sinema, who supports this, points out—hearing is directly related to dementia. When you can't hear, you have a problem, and it impacts on dementia.</p>, <p>So we're able to, I—and it's cheaper to be able to take care of the hearing. But I think I've been able to take care of that without changing Medicare, because what's happening is, now you have these hearing aid companies; you no longer are going to have to go to the doctor and spend 5 grand and get an appointment—you can go buy at Walgreens, and buy over-the-counter hearing aids.</p>, <p>So—the harder one, though, is we—we haven't gotten a consensus yet on how to deal with seeing, glasses. And—but that's—so ""it's not done yet"" is the answer.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> All right. I want to get another question in. This is Ben Frederick. Ben is a realtor, a lifelong resident of Baltimore. He's an independent. Serves on the Maryland Multi-Housing Association.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> By the way, Ben, the Bidens all hail from Baltimore, beginning in 1850. [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't know how the hell they kicked me out, but I'm—[<i>laughter</i>].</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Ben, what's your question?</p>, <p><i>Tax Code Reform/Corporate Tax Rate </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>IRS data shows that the top 5 percent of income earners pays 60 percent of the income taxes in this country. I hear you repeatedly say that the wealthy are not paying their fair share of income taxes. What is the percentage of income that you believe is fair?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I think what's fair is that—this present Tax Code, the highest tax rate is 35 percent, number one. Okay?</p>, <p>Number two, you're in a circumstance where corporate America is not paying their fair share. And I come from the corporate State of the world: Delaware. More corporations in Delaware than every other State in the union combined. Okay?</p>, <p>Now, here's the deal though: You have 55 corporations, for example, in the United States of America making over $40 billion don't pay a cent. Not a single little red cent.</p>, <p>Now, I don't care—I'm a capitalist. I hope you can be a millionaire or a billionaire. I—not a problem. But at least pay your fair share. Chip in a little bit.</p>, <p>And so——</p>, <p><i>Corporate Tax Rate </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Well, let me—let me follow up, because Kyrsten Sinema, who you mentioned—Senator Sinema is opposed to any tax rate hikes for corporations and for high earners. Speaker Pelosi suggested today she could accept that.</p>, <p>The question is: A, would you accept that—no rate hikes—tax rate hikes for corporations or high earners? And if so, how would you pay for this plan otherwise?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Because you don't have—look, here's the deal: The tax rate—the corporate tax rate was 35 points-something—37 percent. Barack and I thought it should come down. We thought it should come down to 28 percent.</p>, <p>In the process, it came down to 21 percent under Trump, which even the corporate leaders—and you know if you're in real estate—major real estate. Ask them. They know they should be paying a little more than 21 percent. Because the idea that if you're a schoolteacher and a firefighter, you're paying at a higher tax rate than they are, as a percentage of your taxes.</p>, <p>But here's the deal: I believe that we can do the—we can pay for this whole thing—I have it written on a card here, but I won't bore you with the detail. But, for example, if you in fact made sure that you paid a minimum 15 percent—minimum 15 percent—if you're paying nothing—minimum 15—that's almost—that's over almost $400 billion over 10 years.</p>, <p><i>Tax Code Reform </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> So you would be willing to go along with what Senator Sinema and, it seems like, Speaker Pelosi is willing to consider: no tax hike for corporations or for high-earning individuals?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Here's what I'm willing to do: I'm willing to make sure that we pay for everything without anyone making less than $400,000 paying a single cent more in taxes. That's my objective.</p>, <p>And so there's ways to do that. For example—you covered it on your show—the minimum international tax at 15 percent.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> But no rate—actual rate hikes?</p>, <p><i>The President's Economic Agenda </i></p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No. No. I don't think we're going to be able to get to vote. Look—[<i>laughter</i>]—when you're in the United States Senate and you're a President of the United States and you have 50 Democrats, every one is a President. [<i>Laughter</i>] Every single one. So you've got to work things out.</p>, <p>But where I am is, I'm hearing now—I'll turn on the news, and I'll hear that ""Biden's caved on such and""—look, Biden has a simple proposition. Biden is going to get—all the elements of these two bills have profound impact on economic growth; reduce, not increase, inflation; don't add a penny to the debt; as well as grow the economy. According—I have 17 Nobel laureates in economics sent me a letter recently saying that my proposals would actually reduce inflation, diminish inflation.</p>, <p>But here's the point. The point of it all is that I'm prepared—I can't think of anything that was consequential in changing the circumstance for the middle class and working class in America that came as a consequence of a single piece of legislation.</p>, <p>I've got a portrait of Roosevelt in my office. Okay? Social Security is not anything like it is today when he passed it. It evolved. It moved. It grew.</p>, <p>So I'm prepared to do the things that can get done now that can begin to change the lives of ordinary Americans to give them a fighting chance and come back and try to get others later.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Let's talk about another one of those things. This is Sondra Guttman, an English professor at Loyola University, also a Democrat.</p>, <p>Sondra, what's your question?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And by the way, you've got another English professor who teaches writing here. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Global Competitiveness/Early Childhood Education </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you for taking my question, Mr. President. We've heard in the news that the proposal for 2 years of free community college may be cut from your economic package. An educated citizenry is absolutely crucial to solving complex problems like climate change and the systematic inequities in this country. We hope that this is not cut from the package, but if it is, what can you do to ensure that all Americans can get the education that they need to face these issues?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, first of all, Professor, you made a very profound point, and I'm not—I'm not being sarcastic—and that is—and Jill uses a slightly different phrase: ""Any country that outeducates us will outcompete us."" Any country that outeducates will—outeducates will outcompete us.</p>, <p>You have the vast majority—of the 37 major countries in the world—economies—we rank 35 in our investment in education. We're in a situation where if you think about it, when we—what caused us to move ahead and dominate the 20th century: In the late 1900s—in the early 1900s, late 1890s, we came up—we said, 12 years of free education. That was revolutionary at the time. I mean, seriously.</p>, <p>Now, if we were sitting down today and saying, ""Oh, we've got to put together an education system,"" raise your hand if anybody thinks 12 years is enough to compete in the 21st century? So that's why what I propose is: free child—free school—free school for every 3- and 4-year-old in America, no matter what their background.</p>, <p>All the data shows that no matter what home they come from, they increase exponentially their prospects of succeeding all the way through 12 years of school. You all—you know all the statistics.</p>, <p>The statistics go that if you come from a home where there's no books in the home and a single mom or a single dad, they don't—they're not well educated, they don't talk a lot, the kid from the middle class—average middle class home versus that home will go to school having heard 1 million more words spoken than the child who didn't. A gigantic disadvantage. So——</p>, <p><i>Community College/Federal Postsecondary Education Assistance </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Mr. President, the question was on—the—on community colleges——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I know. I——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper. </i>——which was a big campaign promise that you made. You talked about that a lot on——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, I——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper. </i>——the campaign trail.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, and I'm going to get it done. And if I don't, I'll be sleeping alone for a long time. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But here's the deal: So far, Mr. Manchin and one other person has indicated they will not support free community college. So what I've—what I think we can get done is, we can significantly increase the amount of money by 500 bucks a payment for Pell grants. And Pell grants are available, and they can apply for up to 30 percent of the cost of community college and/or—and/or—college, help tuition.</p>, <p>So it's not going to get us there. It's not going to get us the whole thing, but it is a start.</p>, <p>I'm convinced—absolutely, positively convinced that we're going to be able to—and, by the way, we have in the law—in the legislation, money for community colleges that deal with—dealing with apprenticeships, dealing with teaching people particular skills that are not getting—will not get you a 2-year degree, but will teach you the skill.</p>, <p>So I think we can get all of that done this time out. But I promise you—I guarantee you, we're going to get free community college in the next several years, I mean, across the board.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> What was that conversation when you realized you weren't able—going to be able to get it in this bill at this time, and you had dinner with Dr. Biden that night, what was that conversation like? [<i>Laughter</i>] How did you break that news?</p>, <p><i>Community College/Global Competitiveness </i></p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, the White House has a lot of bedrooms. [<i>Laughter</i>] And she went like this. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President pointed his finger.</i>]</p>, <p>""Down the hall.""</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> All right.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, look, it really makes a gigantic difference. And think of this: You have more countries in the world with—having—providing college—I mean, providing professional education beyond 12 years. We rank like, I think it's—don't hold me to the number—I think it's 16 or 17 in the world—the United States of America, for God's sake.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> I want——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> This is about putting us in the game.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> This is John Meche. He's a doctoral candidate at Morgan State University and an independent. John, welcome. What's your question?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Where—where are you?</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Morgan State.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Morgan State.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I know all these Morgan men, man.</p>, <p>I've spoken there a couple times. And by the way, the guy who runs my operation is a—anyway—[<i>laughter</i>]—I keep talking about Delaware State, but they keep saying about Morgan State, you know?</p>, <p><i>Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation/Education and Family Assistance Legislation </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Morgan State. President Biden, I had so much faith in your election win, but based on history, the bipartisan efforts of the Democratic Party are held hostage by rogue moderates and Republicans. Why not do like the Republicans and usher through the Democratic agenda?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, two reasons. If you notice, the Republicans haven't passed a single, solitary thing. Zero. So, ushering through their agenda—their agenda right now is just ""stop Biden."" Although, I shouldn't make it so personal. ""Stop my administration""—that's what the agenda is. It's much easier to stop something than to start something.</p>, <p>And look, what we did is, when I wrote—I'm going to back up just a second. I apologize. I wrote—I personally—during the campaign, before I got elected, I wrote the infrastructure bill relating to what we do to highways and all that kind of thing. Hard—hard data. And I wrote the—what they call—what's now called the ""care economy"" piece and has a gigantic piece of environmental pieces in it too.</p>, <p>And I went before the joint session of Congress, and I laid out exactly what I was for. And so, I made it clear what I was for. Initially what happened was, I got no support for anything from our Republican friends. And then they said, ""Maybe we can work out a bipartisan deal on infrastructure."" And we did. We worked on it. It didn't give me everything I wanted. It didn't have as much money in there for the environment, although it has tens of billions of dollars in there, but didn't have what I wanted in it. But we made a bipartisan deal.</p>, <p>Now, what's coming along is this reconciliation—they call it a fancy word—for the other pieces that have the childcare pieces, have the economy that relates to allowing people to—women to go back to work. It has about $450 billion for environmental remediation and so on.</p>, <p>And that's the one that is the issue.</p>, <p><i>Senator Kyrsten L. Sinema/The President's Economic Agenda </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Well, let me—let me ask you—just getting to his question: You—we've talked a lot about Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema. You seem relatively confident you can kind of get Senator Manchin on board.</p>, <p>You—there's a lot of Democrats in the House and Senate who are confused about where Senator Sinema actually stands on things. And I know she's been negotiating directly with you and the White House. What is your read on her?</p>, <p>And I—obviously, you need her to remain positive in your direction, so I don't know what you're going to say. [<i>Laughter</i>] But what is your read on her?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, seriously.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Do you know where she stands?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> First of all, she's smart as the devil, number one. Number two, she's very supportive of the environmental agenda in my legislation—very supportive. She's supportive of all—almost all the things I mentioned, relating to everything from family care to all those issues.</p>, <p>Where she's not supportive is she says she will not raise a single penny in taxes on the corporate side and/or on wealthy people. Period. And so that's where it sort of breaks down, and there's a few other issues it breaks down on.</p>, <p>But what we're trying to do is reach a point here where I'm able to present to the Senate—they're able to vote on—and the House—a serious, serious piece of legislation that changes the dynamic for working class folks in America and middle class folks, and begins to have the very wealthy and corporations just begin to pay their fair share—not a lot.</p>, <p>How we get there—we're down to four or five issues, which I'm not going to negotiate on national television, as you might guess.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> We'd be interested——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, no, no.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper. </i>——in hearing them, if you want. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, no, no. I know. But, all kidding aside, I think we can get there.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> You talked about the environmental piece. You said Senator Sinema is on board with that. Certainly, Senator Manchin is not. It gets to our next question.</p>, <p>This is from Kobi Khong. He's originally from Anaheim, California. He's a sophomore class president at Johns Hopkins University, a Democrat.</p>, <p>Kobi, what's your question?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Mr. President. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Climate Change/Paris Agreement </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>One of the largest issues that people have trouble comprehending the severity of is climate change. Many legislators and politicians today are lenient, as they won't have to live with the future effects. Without the legislative support for the climate aspects of your budget proposal and the earth rapidly approaching the Paris Agreement's 1.5 degrees limit, what other backup plans do you have to ensure a future for the next generations?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, that's—[<i>applause</i>]. Mr. President, you've got it right. The existential threat to humanity is climate change. And when President Trump pulled out of the Paris accord—which, when I was with the Obama administration, we helped negotiate—the agreement was that we could not—if we reached beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius increase in temperature, we're gone. Not a joke. Not a joke.</p>, <p>And so we decided that—he pulled out. First thing I committed to do is rejoin that accord, number one. But number two—number two: What you have to do, is you look at—there's multiple ways in which we can deal with climate. I'm going off to COP26 in Scotland, and—in, I don't know, I guess it's 2 weeks or a week. I can't—I'm losing track of time.</p>, <p>And I'm presenting a commitment to the world that we will, in fact, get to net-zero emissions on electric power by 2035 and net-zero emissions across the board by 2050 or before. But we have to do so much between now and 2030 to demonstrate what we're going to—that we're going to do.</p>, <p>So let me give you a couple examples.</p>, <p><i>Climate Measures in the Budget Reconciliation Package/Senator Joseph A. Manchin III/Energy Efficiency and Weatherization </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Can I—let me just follow up, though, very quickly on that, because the key climate provision that was in the Build Back Better plan, as you call it—the Clean Electricity Performance Program—that's been dropped now from this spending bill. Reported——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, it hasn't.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> It has not?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, it hasn't—look——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> But Senator Manchin is opposed to that.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> He's opposed to it. But here's the deal: That is only one of well over—well over a trillion dollars' worth of expenditures for climate change. It's $150 billion. It's important.</p>, <p>And what it says is that if in fact the utility doesn't pull back and continue to reduce the amount of carbon that they emit, that what will happen is they will end up paying a penalty. And so there's a penalty incurred.</p>, <p>Joe Manchin's argument is: Look, we still have coal in my State. You're going to eliminate it eventually. We know it's going away. We know it's going to be gone. But don't rush it so fast that my people don't have anything to do.</p>, <p>I think that's not what we should be doing, but the fact of the matter is, we can take that $150 billion, add it to the $320 billion that's in the—in the law now that he's prepared to support for tax incentives—tax incentives—to have people act in a way that they're going to be able to do the things that need to be do from—for example, if you're—if you've got windows that are the, you know, the wind is blowing through, you get an incentive to put new windows in your home. You get—you—help get it paid.</p>, <p>We're going to significantly reduce the amount—the cost of solar panels on your roof. We're going to continually—and, for example, there's new battery technologies that are being—I went out in Silicon Valley; there's a battery that's about that wide and about that thick. If you have solar power, you put that in your basement and the sun doesn't shine for 7 days, you still have all the power you need.</p>, <p><i>Energy Grid Improvement Efforts/Climate Resilience Measures </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> But the concession has been agreed to for Senator Manchin——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, no, no.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper. </i>——about coal in his State.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, no——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Is that true?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Nothing has been formally agreed to. The concession has been—the negotiation is: I've been saying to Joe: ""Look, I'll take—if we don't do it in terms of the electric grid piece, what we'll do is—give me that $150 billion. I'm going to add it to be able to do other things that allow me to do things that don't directly affect the electric grid in the way that there's a penalty, but allow me to spend the money to set new technologies in place.""</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Okay.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> For example, we can save significant amounts of money and, as a consequence of that, significant amounts of energy, if in fact we are able to put the high-tension wires underground. It costs a hell of a lot more to do it. It creates real good jobs; it creates a hell of a lot more to do it. But, in fact, it would do a lot to keep things from happening that are dangerous. Half the forest fires out West are those towers coming down, setting fires, et cetera.</p>, <p>So there's a lot of things Joe is open to my convincing him that I can use it to increase environmental progress without it being that particular deal.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> We're going to take a quick break. When we get back, we got a lot more questions for President Biden.</p>, <p>[<i>There was a commercial break.</i>]</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> And welcome back. We are live at a CNN town hall event in Baltimore, Maryland, with President Joe Biden.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Pandemic Effects on the Labor Market/Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts/Morale of the Country </i></p>, <p>So, before we get to our next question, I want to just bring up the current labor market shortages. Millions of jobs are unfilled, businesses are struggling to meet demand. Is there anything you can do to either encourage people to go back to work or make jobs more attractive that they want to go back to work?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, so, first——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Is there a role for the Federal Government?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> First of all, we've created more jobs in the first 8 months of my Administration than any President in American history—total number of jobs created.</p>, <p>But the problem for the people not going back to work is twofold. Number one, they're reluctant to go back to work because they're afraid of COVID, many of them. So they don't want to go back, and they don't want to be exposed to either the customers, because they're not required to wear masks or not required to have shots, or they don't want to go back because they're not sure of the people waiting on them and they—at the table, or the people coming up in the food market. So a lot of it has to do with COVID. Number one.</p>, <p>Number two—and that's why, you know, we were able to go from—when I first got elected—when I first was elected, there were only 2 million people who had COVID shots in the United States of America—had the vaccine. Now we got 190 million, because I went out and bought everything I could do—and buy in sight, and it worked.</p>, <p>But here's the deal: The second thing—the second thing that has happened, Anderson, is that people are now using this as an opportunity to say, ""Wait a minute, do I want to go back to that $7-an-hour job?""</p>, <p>I won't name the particular restaurant chain, but they found out when they—they couldn't hire anybody. When they found out, they started to pay 20 bucks an hour, everybody wanted to go back to work. Not a joke.</p>, <p>So what you see is, wages are actually up for those who are working, because for the first time in a long time, employees are able to bargain. ""You're the boss? You want me to work for you? What are you going to pay me? How are you going to do it?"" I'm not being facetious.</p>, <p>The third thing that's out there is, there's a circumstance that exists where people are really worried about what they're going to do—I mean, how can I say this?</p>, <p>How many people do you know—and maybe some in this audience—who, because of what you've been through—a loss of a husband, wife, brother, mother, father, son, whatever—or you've had something that's really impacted you with COVID that you really find yourself just down? I mean just down. And so, there's a lot of people who are just down. They're not sure how to get back in the game. They're not sure whether they want to get back in the game.</p>, <p>Think of this: If you're graduating from Morgan State, okay? Right? Well, guess what? You didn't have those great dances the last 4 years that you'd had before you went out at Morgan. No, I'm not joking. Graduated from high school, you don't have your prom, you don't have your graduation, you don't have the thing—all the things that matter to people that go into things they look forward to. So a lot of it has to do with us getting back on our feet and getting back on our feet in terms of our attitudes about what the future looks like for us.</p>, <p><i>Mental Health Services </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> What do you say to someone who's down? Because——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> What I say——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper. </i>——there's a lot of people watching tonight who are.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, there are. And I tell you what: There's plenty of help. Look, being down, having some problem in terms of needing some—some advice—if you have a broken spirit, it's no different than a broken arm. You shouldn't be ashamed of it. You should seek the help. There's a lot of people who can help.</p>, <p>And—but I really mean it.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I don't—I'm not saying that's the whole problem, but I'm saying it is an element in terms of attitude about people—what they want to—look, how often I get asked the question: ""What's Christmas going to be like? How about Thanksgiving? Is it going to be okay? I mean, what's going to happen? I mean, how will I be able to buy gifts for my kids?"" How—there's a lot of anxiety people have.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Yes. I want to ask a question along the lines of concern about Christmas and holidays and the supply chain.</p>, <p>Anna Hirsch is here, a student at Loyola University, who is originally from Connecticut. She's a Democrat. Anna, what's your question?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Hello, Anna.</p>, <p><i>Global Supply Chain Disruptions </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>President Biden, growing up in a small town, I've been surrounded by small-business owners, including my mom who owns her own interior design business. With the current supply chain crisis, small businesses are in jeopardy of not being able to get products that they need——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> They are.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>——because priority is given to large businesses. Does your administration have any policies or plans in place to aid the current supply chain problem and/or to help small businesses that are affected by this?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes on both. Here—but you have it exactly right. We have a significant supply chain problem.</p>, <p>In the Obama-Biden administration, all of American business—and it made sense—it was ""just on time."" You wanted to make sure that you didn't waste any money and/or time between producing whatever you're producing and having it done. You didn't—so that's how you saved money. You didn't buy the material 6 months ahead of time and then keep it in your inventory and then move it. It was on time.</p>, <p>Now, that's a big problem. You can't—people can't do it. They want to get out ahead. What I've recently done—and people said—doubted we could get it done. I was able to go to the private ports—40 percent of all products coming into the United States of America on the West Coast go through Los Angeles and—oh, what am I doing here?</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Is it Long Beach or——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Long Beach. Thank you.</p>, <p>And I know both the mayors. So I went to them, and I said, ""What can we do?"" So I met with—and they're privately owned, these ports—these two. So I met with the business people. I met with all their major customers—the Walmarts of the world and all the rest. There are like 70 ships waiting out there unable to get unloaded.</p>, <p>So I—and because—not always—the longshoremen don't always get along with the business folks in there. I got—I have a relationship with them. And I brought them together, and I said: ""You've got to be open 24/7."" No port there was open—open 5 days a week, 40 hours a week. 24/7—they've all agreed to it. They've agreed to it.</p>, <p><i>National Guard/Port Infrastructure Improvements </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Would you consider the National Guard to help with the supply chain issue?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, absolutely, positively, I would do that. But in addition to that, what you've got to do is, you've got to get these ships in and unloaded.</p>, <p>And one of the things in my infrastructure plan: There's $16 billion for port expansion. We have to be able to move things along. Because what's happening is, when we—a product your mother may need for interior design, in terms of drapery or colors or something, that is imported from somewhere else. Well, guess what? A lot of these places, particularly in South Asia, are closing down because of COVID. The businesses are just flat closing. They're——-</p>, <p><i>Global Supply Chain Disruptions </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> So would you consider the National Guard for trucking? For—because there's a lot of problems——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper. </i>——with not enough truck drivers right now.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. But here's—and that's why what we're doing now——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Do you have a timetable for that?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I had a timetable to—first of all, I want to get the ports up and running, and get the railroads and the rail heads and the trucks in port ready to move. Because I've gotten Walmart and others that say, ""We're going to move stuff off of the port, into our warehouses.""—which<i> </i>they weren't doing.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> So are you—but you're actually talking about having National Guardsmen and women——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> The answer is——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper. </i>——driving trucks?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> The answer is: Yes, if we can't move the—increase the number of truckers, which we're in the process of doing.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Okay.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> If we did at this moment, we're not—but the whole point is: We've got to get the small business as well, because the big guys are in trouble. And a lot of the product that your mother makes, the product she—the things she does in her interior design building, the material she buys from the larger outfits. I assume; I don't know that.</p>, <p>I shouldn't—but my whole point is: Small businesses need the help badly. Small businesses make up 60 percent of all the revenue coming from business out there.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> I want to bring in Linda Harris. She's from Elkridge, Maryland. She's a software project manager, Democrat. Linda, what's your question?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Hey, President Biden.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Hey.</p>, <p><i>Economic Stimulus Payments </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>My middle-class family of four lives on a pretty tight budget. My husband and I both work full-time at well-paying jobs, but we still struggle some months to make the ends meet. With rising gas prices and utility prices and grocery prices, we're feeling our discretionary income get squeezed and reduced. What plans does the administration have to help ease this kind of current crunch we're feeling?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, there's a number of things that have already been done. And it's hard—and people don't think about—the American Rescue Plan has provided for an awful lot—the $1.9 billion we passed right at—right after I got elected.</p>, <p>So what you got is, you got that—that $1,400 check in the mail, and you got a lot of things that help ameliorate some of the concerns and costs, because we knew what we were coming into. We knew we had inherited the wind, and things were going to get worse before they got better.</p>, <p>But in terms of being able to have what my dad used to say, ""a little breathing room,"" just a little—my dad busted his neck. He didn't have a good-paying job. My dad was a well-read, high school-educated guy who thought his greatest sin in the world was he didn't get to go to college.</p>, <p>And—but my dad was one of those guys that worked like hell, would come home for dinner, and then he'd go back and finish up work and close the shop. He—and the whole point of it was that all we want to give—all he'd talk about is, ""Joey, all I need is just a little breathing room, a little space—a little space.""</p>, <p><i>Inflation/Gasoline Prices </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Let me—let me ask you about that, just in terms of inflation, because you had told us at a town hall, I think it was in July, that the—this was just near-term inflation. The Wall Street Journal recently talked to like 67 financial experts who said that they saw high inflation going all the way—or deep into 2022. Do you think it's going to last for a while?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I don't think so. I don't think it will last if—depending what we do. If we stay exactly where we are, yes. If we don't make these investments, yes.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> What about gas prices? Because some States——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Gas price——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper. </i>——are seeing——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Gas prices relate to a foreign policy initiative that is about something that goes beyond the cost of gas. And we're about $3.30 a gallon most places now, when it's up from—when it was down in the single digits. I mean—single—a dollar-plus. And that's because of the supply being withheld by OPEC.</p>, <p>And so there's a lot of negotiation that is—there's a lot of Middle Eastern folks who want to talk to me.<i> </i>I'm not sure I'm going to talk to them. But the point is, it's about gas production. There's things we can do, in the meantime, though.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Do you think there's a—I mean, do you see a—do you have a timeline for gas prices of when you think they may start coming down?</p>, <p><i>Gasoline Prices/Home Heating Assistance/Renewable Energy/Automobile Industry/Strategic Petroleum Reserve </i></p>, <p><i>The President.</i> My guess is, you'll start to see gas prices come down as we get by—going into the winter—I mean, excuse me, into next year, in 2022. I don't see anything that's going to happen in the meantime that's going to significantly reduce gas prices.</p>, <p>But, for example, for natural gas to heat your homes as winter is coming, there's a lot—what people don't realize: We put in billions of dollars in what they call LIHEAP. LIHEAP is the provision whereby you're able to get funding from the Federal Government based upon your need to heat your home, and it is subsidized in a significant way. And there's billions of dollars we have passed in the legislation I got passed in March of this year, because we anticipated that would be a problem as well.</p>, <p>But the answer ultimately is—""ultimately"" meaning the next 3 or 4 years—is investing in renewable energy. What I was able to do——no, I—and, by the way, I really—I'm not—I'm not being—I mean, I'm being literal when I say this: What I was able to do when I ran—and you remember, Anderson, because I was on your show a couple times, and the issue was whether or not I could ever get the labor unions to support my environmental programs.</p>, <p>And I went out, and I went to the IBEW and, as well, to the autoworkers, and I laid out my plan. They fully embraced it. Why? Because—and I spent time at General Motors and other companies, and I got General Motors—I didn't get them—General Motors decided, after a long time spent talking to me—they were suing California because they had a higher standard—mileage standard.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Right.</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>They dropped the suit and agreed that they would be 50-percent electric vehicles by 2030—by 2030. And now you have all three—all three major manufacturers—saying the same thing.</p>, <p>So what will happen is, you're going to see a dramatic drop—a dramatic drop in what's going to happen in terms of gas prices as we go into the next 2 or 3 years. Even if we're not able to break the monopoly price—they're keeping it up because—anyway.</p>, <p>So there's—there—but I don't—I must tell you, I don't have a near-term answer. There's two things I could do: I could go in the petroleum reserve and take out and probably reduce the price of gas maybe 18 cents or so a gallon. It's still going to be above 3 bucks.</p>, <p>And one of the things that I refuse to have happen, because I didn't want anybody—I made a commitment: If you pass the stuff I'm talking about, not—not one single penny in tax would go against anybody making less than 400 grand.</p>, <p>And so, if you notice, this is—these highway bills are not paid for by gas tax. They're paid for by direct expenditures in other areas. So the average person doesn't have to pay more.</p>, <p>But it's going to be hard. It's going to be hard. There's a possibility to be able to bring it down. Depends on—little bit on Saudi Arabia and a few other things that are in the offing.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Let me take a quick break. We'll have more from President Joe Biden.</p>, <p>[<i>There was a commercial break.</i>]</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> And welcome back to our CNN town hall with President Joe Biden. Got a lot more questions to get to.</p>, <p>I want to introduce Neijma Donner, a professor and social worker at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. She's an independent and mother of two young boys. We're going to be talking about COVID.</p>, <p>Neijma, what's your question?</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Vaccines for Young Children/National Vaccination Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you for taking my question, President. When will the vaccines for young children be ready? And how accessible will they be once released?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I believe—and I want to make it clear: Unlike past administrations, science will dictate this. I'm not telling anyone at NIH—[<i>applause</i>]. No, I really mean it.</p>, <p>But I do ask my COVID team what the expectations are. The expectations are, it will be ready in the near term—meaning weeks, not—not months and months. Okay? That's number one.</p>, <p>Number two, there are over 800,000 sites right now that exist in America where you can go get a vaccine. And you're going to be able to do that with your children, particularly—we're going to try to work it out to deal with childcare centers—make it available there—as well as your pediatricians and the—you know, and the docs—and finding places where you can do it. Some places are talking about doing at—you know, in churches on the weekend and that kind of thing.</p>, <p>So there'll be plenty of places to be able to get the vaccine when—if and when it is approved.</p>, <p>And it's likely to be approved. I spent a lot of time with the team on these things. And it's likely to be approved and what—whether it's Moderna or whether it's Pfizer or whether it's J&amp;J, it's going to be approved. And it will be a much smaller dose, basically the same dose, but a smaller dose. And they're doing a lot of tests on it right now.</p>, <p>And those of you who have children or brothers or sisters who are between—you know, who are in that age category above 12, get the vaccine for them. Get the vaccine. Get it now.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Let me ask you—Mr. President—Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> By the way, there's two famous guys in this audience here. I just noticed. [<i>Laughter</i>] Ben Cardin—and Chris Van Hollen. And the mayor! Holy mackerel.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Mr.——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> This is a busman's holiday for you guys, having to come here. [<i>Laughter</i>] But thank you.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Vaccine Mandates </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Mr. President, let me ask you a follow-up about that. As many as one in three emergency responders in some cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, right here in Baltimore, are refusing to comply with city vaccine mandates.</p>, <p>I'm wondering where you stand on that. Should police officers, emergency responders be mandated to get vaccines? And if not, should they be—stay at home or let go?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes and yes.</p>, <p>And by the way—[<i>applause</i>]. By the way, I waited until July to talk about mandating, because I tried everything else possible. The mandates are working. All the stuff about people leaving and people getting—you have—you have everyone from United Airlines to Spirit—all these airlines. They're—we're not going to get all—96, 97 percent of the people have gotten the vaccine.</p>, <p>All the talk about all these folks who are going to leave the military if they were mandated—not true. You've got about a 90-something percent vaccination rate.</p>, <p>I mean, so there's a—the idea is that—look, the two things that concern me—one, are those who just tried to make this a political issue. ""Freedom. I have the freedom to kill you with my COVID."" [<i>Laughter</i>] No, I mean, come on. ""Freedom."" [<i>Laughter</i>] Number one.</p>, <p>Number two—the second one is that, you know, the gross misinformation that's out there. Like what they're saying about my buddy Colin Powell—and he was my friend—who passed away. ""Colin Powell was vaccinated, and he still died."" Well, he knew he had serious underlying conditions. And it would be difficult—he clearly would have been gone earlier had he not gotten the vaccine, had he not gotten the shots.</p>, <p>But my generic point is: There's so much misinformation. And you know what I find fascinating? I turn on Fox to find out how popular I am. [<i>Laughter</i>] Well, I——</p>, <p><i>Fox News/Coronavirus Vaccine Mandates </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> How are you doing there?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm doing very well. [<i>Laughter</i>] I think I'm at 3 percent favorable. But—[<i>laughter</i>].</p>, <p>But all kidding aside, one of the things I find: Do you realize they mandate vaccinations?</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> At Fox headquarters.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. I find that mildly fascinating.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> You find that mildly fascinating? [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Mildly fascinating.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> I want to bring in—[<i>laughter</i>]—Thaddeus Price from—[<i>applause</i>]. This is Thaddeus Price from Randallstown, Maryland. He's a program coordinator at Morgan State University and a Democrat.</p>, <p>Thaddeus, welcome.</p>, <p><i>The President's Legislative Agenda/Police Reform/Voting Rights Legislation </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Good evening, Mr. President. You received overwhelming support from the Black community, and rightfully so. Rightfully so. But now many of us are disheartened——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>——as we watch a Congress fail to support police reform. We watch our voting rights vanish before our very eyes.</p>, <p>Mr. President, my question is: What will you do over the next 3 years to rectify these atrocities, secure our democracy, and ensure that freedoms and liberties that all Americans should be entitled to?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> First of all, you've stated the proposition accurately, in my view. I did get overwhelming support from the African American community. Only folks in Maryland understand Delaware is the eighth largest Black population in America, as a percent of population. It's been the source of my support. The only folks that helped me more than Black men are Black women.</p>, <p>And I tell you what my greatest regret is: My greatest regret is I have these—had these three major pieces of legislation that are going to change the circumstances for working class folks and African Americans as well, that I've been busting my neck trying to pass. But what it's done is prevented me from getting deeply up to my ears—which I'm going to do once this is done—in dealing with police brutality, dealing with the whole notion of: What are we going to do about voting rights? It's the greatest assault on voting rights in the history of the United States—for real—since the Civil War.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Yes. Yes, sir.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And you know, for example: When I was in the chairman—when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I thought I had done something really important. And I was able to get passed and extended the Voting Rights Act for 25 years and get everyone on that committee, including the southern—the Senator from South Carolina and others, to vote for it. I thought we had moved.</p>, <p>The point I'm making is this: We're at a terrible place right now. And so, when this gets done—and in the meantime, here's what I've done: I have the authority to deal with Federal law enforcement.</p>, <p>So Federal law enforcement, I've—we've issued mandates: no chokeholds, number one; make sure that we're going to be able to do—have no no-knock warrants; in a position where we're going to be able to see to it that we are able to go look at—and we're doing it in four cities right now—patterns of abuse and patterns of misconduct of police departments; making sure that we have access to police records, in terms of what's happening in—so there's a lot I've been able to do by Executive order, in essence.</p>, <p><i>Use of the Filibuster in the Senate/Talking Requirement for the Filibuster/Public Debt Limit </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Let me ask you, on voting rights: If it is as important to you as you say, I think there's a lot of Democrats who look at the filibuster and would like to see it changed, even if it was just on this one case. Why do you oppose that?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> By the way, I think they make a very good point.</p>, <p>Here's the deal: If in fact I get myself into, at this moment, the debate on the filibuster, I lose three—at least three votes right now to get what I have to get done on the economic side of the equation—the foreign policy side of the equation.</p>, <p>So what I have said—you're shaking your head no, but let me tell you something, Jack: It's the truth. [<i>Laughter</i>] Number one.</p>, <p>Number two. Number two, what I have proposed in the meantime is—it used to be the filibuster. The way it worked—and we have 10 times as many—more than that—times the filibuster has been used since 1978. It used to be you had to stand on the floor and exhaust everything you had, and you—when—and when you gave up the floor and someone else sought the floor, they had to talk until they finished. You're only allowed to do it a second time. After that, it's over; you vote—somebody moves for the vote. I propose we bring that back now, immediately.</p>, <p>But I also think we're going to have to move to the point where we fundamentally alter the filibuster. The idea that, for example, my Republican friends say that we're going to default on the national debt because they're going to filibuster that and we need 10 Republicans to support us is the most bizarre thing I ever heard.</p>, <p>I think you're going to see an—if they—gets pulled again, I think you'll see an awful lot of Democrats being ready to say: ""Not me. I'm not doing that again. We're going to end the filibuster.""</p>, <p>But it still is difficult to end the filibuster, beyond that. That's another issue. But——</p>, <p><i>Use of the Filibuster in the Senate/Public Debt Limit </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> But are you saying once you get this current agenda passed on spending and social programs that you would be open to fundamentally altering the filibuster or——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I am open to——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper. </i>——doing away with it?</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>——fundamentally altering——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Or doing away with it?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, that remains to be seen, exactly what that means, in terms of ""fundamentally altering"" it, whether or not we just end the filibuster straight up.</p>, <p>There are certain things that are just sacred rights. One's a sacred obligation that we never are going to renege on a debt. We're the only nation in the world—we have never, ever reneged on a single debt.</p>, <p><i>Voting Rights Legislation </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> But when it comes to voting rights, do you——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Voting rights is equally as consequential.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> When it comes to voting rights—just so I'm clear, though—you would entertain the notion of doing away with the filibuster on that one issue? Is that correct?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And maybe more.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> And maybe other issues?</p>, <p>Okay, let's—just a short time ago, the full House voted to hold—to hold former Trump ally, Steve Bannon—current Trump ally as well—[<i>laughter</i>]—in criminal contempt of Congress.</p>, <p><i>House Select Committee To Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol/Independence of the Department of Justice </i></p>, <p>A week ago, you said the Department of Justice should prosecute those who defied subpoenas from the January 6 committee. Was that appropriate for you to weigh in on?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, the way I said it was not appropriate. I said—they asked me would I—do I think that he—they should be prosecuted for denying the—for not showing up at the committee. And I said, ""Yes.""</p>, <p>Now that—when I've made a commitment—the—one of the things I was committed to do when I ran was reestablish the reputation and integrity of the Justice Department. It has become the most—it was corrupted under the last administration.</p>, <p>I should have chosen my words more wisely. I did not, have not, and will not pick up the phone and call the Attorney General and tell him what he should or should not do in terms of who he should prosecute.</p>, <p>But I answered the question honestly. And I think that a—anyone who does not respond to that kind of—question from the—from the—a legitimate committee in the House of Representatives or the United States Senate should be held accountable.</p>, <p>So that's as much as I can say without coming and looking like I'm telling the—I have yet to talk to the Attorney General about anything——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> The Attorney General put out a statement saying that they would make the decision on their own.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And they will.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I guarantee that.</p>, <p><i>Executive Privilege/House Select Committee To Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> You've decided not to exert executive privilege to shield the former President in the House's investigation into January 6. Why? What were you——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, again, I'm leaving that to them to tell me what—and I didn't—it's not a blanket ""I will not release the information."" It's, I'm asking them to take a look at what is legitimate—what would legitimately fall in the position that future Presidents' authority would be compromised by that, and what is. I don't think there's much legitimacy in the claim.</p>, <p>So that's being looked at right now.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> We're going to take another quick break. We'll have more with President Joe Biden.</p>, <p>[<i>There was a commercial break.</i>]</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> And welcome back to our CNN town hall with President Joe Biden. We're taking questions from the audience on a range of topics.</p>, <p>I want to bring in Megan Crawford from Towson, Maryland. She's a law student at the University of Baltimore and a Republican.</p>, <p>Megan, welcome.</p>, <p><i>Immigration Policy/Unaccompanied Minors at the Southern U.S. Border Addressing the Root Causes of Migration </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Throughout your campaign, you've criticized former President Trump for his treatment of illegal immigrants and the southern border. Given that it's nearly been a year into your campaign, why haven't you been to the southern border of our country? And why did your stance on allowing immigrants suddenly revert to Trump-era policies?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, they're legitimate questions. Number one, the ""remain in Mexico"" policy, which I oppose, the Court said I had to maintain it. So we're repealing it. That's one of the reasons why we haven't changed it.</p>, <p>We have made a gigantic change—there were over 5,000 children—children—in the custody of the Border Patrol. There are now 504. We are making more progress than you think.</p>, <p>And we have a circumstance where one of the things that is going to bear fruit, I believe, is: I put together a program when I was a Senator, and the Vice President is helping—helping initiate it now, where we provide for funding to change the circumstances on the ground in the countries in Central America.</p>, <p>For example, you're in a circumstance where, you know, people don't just sit around their—their hand-hewn table and say: ""I've got a great idea: Let's sell everything we have, give it to coyote, let them take us across the border, drop us in a desert—a place they don't want us. Won't that be fun?""</p>, <p>People do it because they're desperate. They're desperate. And what I've been trying to do—and I'm trying to do in this legislation, as well—is get funding so we have funding for immigration officers to be able to hear cases immediately of whether or not they justify having asylum granted to them.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Pandemic Impact on Immigration Policy/Unaccompanied Minors at the Southern U.S. Border/U.S. Provision of Coronavirus Vaccines </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> We don't have that.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> You have kept in place, under a public health authority known as title 42——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper. </i>——which is a Trump-era policy, which allows immediate or very quick return to people who crossed over the border based on COVID protocols.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. And that is—we've maintained that because of the extent of the—of the—continued extent of COVID in those countries from which people are coming. It's very, very high. And so we've maintained the policy.</p>, <p>We are not sending back children. We send back adults, and we send back—large families. But we don't send back children in that circumstance.</p>, <p>And so that's why I have a proposal to provide for over a billion doses of COVID vaccine to the rest of the world, including a significant portion to Latin and Central America.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Do you have plans to visit the southern border?</p>, <p><i>The President's Travel Schedule/U.S. Border Policy </i></p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I've been there before, and I haven't—I mean, I know it well. I guess I should go down. But the whole point of it is: I haven't had a whole hell of lot of time to get down. I've been spending time going around looking at the $900 billion worth of damage done by hurricanes and floods and weather and traveling around the world.</p>, <p>But I plan on—now, my wife, Jill, has been down. She's been on both sides of the river. She's seen the circumstances there. She's looked into those places. You notice you're not seeing a lot of pictures of kids lying on top of one another with—you know, with, you know, looks like tarps on top of them.</p>, <p>We've been able to deal that—we've been able to significantly increase funding through the HHS—Health and Human Services—to provide shelter for these kids and people. But there's much more to be done.</p>, <p>And I realize—I—think it is—it's the thing that concerns me the most about being able to get control of it. Because I've got to, number one, get enough funding to provide for immediate determination of whether or not someone that is, in fact, legitimately claiming a right to stay in the country because of legitimate fears. And if it's purely for economic reasons to get in line, but not get in the country.</p>, <p>So what we're doing is bringing a lot of folks who are coming in, and they're doing ankle bracelets instead of people being sent back, depending on whether or not their claim appears to be legitimate.</p>, <p><i>Police Reform Efforts in Minneapolis, Minnesota/Law Enforcement Best Practices/Community-Oriented Policing Practices </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Let me ask you about two other issues in the news. In less than 2 weeks, Minneapolis voters are going to decide whether or not to replace the police department in Minneapolis with what they would call a ""Public Safety Department."" What do you think of that?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, it depends what they mean by that. Look, I—grew up in a neighborhood——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> They said the Public Safety Department would be—have a more comprehensive public health approach to the delivery of functions of public safety and could include licensed peace officers, police officers.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, could. I think you need police officers. I think we need police officers to protect us. I think they have to be under certain changed circumstances. But I think we have to provide for them more opportunity—I call for more money for police to go to community policing, as well as dealing with additional help for psychologists and others working with police departments.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> You've never been a fan of defunding police.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I haven't. I've never supported. But I've been a fan—of controlling police and making sure they're held accountable. That's a—they're two different issues.</p>, <p>And one of the things—look, when we had community policing, initially in the late nineties, violent crime dropped significantly—significantly. And the reason it did is because we had significant number of police. What I did: I eliminated the LEAA funding—Law Enforcement Assistance Act—and I put in place the proposal that required community policing.</p>, <p>What that meant was: If you were all—it's going to take a second, but it's important. [<i>Laughter</i>] If your—what that meant, if your city had authorized a police force of 100 people, you could not take the money for community policing and fire 50 people and rehire 50 so now I just had the Federal Government paying for half and you didn't increase the number of police.</p>, <p>You had to increase the number of police beyond your—whatever. So I remember my son Beau was the chief law enforcement officer of the State of Delaware as attorney general of the State of Delaware. And he used to do what I did.</p>, <p>He'd go down the east side where you can find the best basketball in the city. You know, every town has those places. And he'd sit there on the bench with my son—my grandson Hunter, who's now 16, who was then 5, sitting the bench, and he'd get to know these guys.</p>, <p>And he'd walk over and he'd knock on the window of the police car that was sitting there—the cop not getting out of the car—and say, ""Get the hell out of the car and meet these folks."" ""No.""</p>, <p>I'll give you one example: What we required initially was every police—every community policeman—there were two assigned—they were assigned in groups of two—they had to know the neighborhood.</p>, <p>I remember getting a call, as you—you've been to Delaware; you go down that road as you're heading down to the train station, Martin Luther King Boulevard. There was a woman who lived in one of those apartments in the second floor that sort of had an outcroppings—a Victorian kind of—it was a two-story place.</p>, <p>And what—but the cops made sure they had—she had their phone number. So, when a drug deal was going down, she'd pick up the phone on call and say to that police officer with a cell phone that the drug deal is going down, knowing that she would never be fingered, knowing that she would never be the one told it happened. And so crime began to drop.</p>, <p>They had to know who owned the local liquor store. They had to know and walk in and shake hands with the local minister. They had to know—that's community policing.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Let me try to get in a couple other questions——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm sorry.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper. —</i>—from our audience.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Ask easy ones.</p>, <p><i>Status of Public Monuments, Memorials, and Statues </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> But before we do, just another quick news question: New York City is removing a statue of Thomas Jefferson from its legislative chamber because of Jefferson's history as a slave holder. Do you support that decision?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I think that's up to the locality to decide what they want to do on that. Look, there's—there's a lot of—there's a lot of people who have no social redeeming value, historically. And there's others who have made serious mistakes in they—in terms of what—what exists now in terms of what we should be talking about, but have done an awful lot.</p>, <p>And so the very thing—for example, I just spoke at the Martin Luther King dedication. And I pointed out that we're right across from the Lincoln Memorial. Well, you know, and—and you talked about—and then the Jefferson Memorial. And what—what are we doing? I talked about how they said: ""We're unique in all the world, as a nation. We're the only nation founded on an idea. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal, endowed by""—no nation has ever been founded on an idea. Have we ever lived up to it? No.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Let me bring——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> But it's a pretty big idea that somebody wrote that down and got the rest of the country to agree to it. So it depends. It depends. And it's—</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Let me bring—let me bring in Glenn Niblo, a student at Loyola University, originally from Connecticut. He's a Republican. Glenn, welcome.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Hi.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Where in Connecticut are you from?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Greenwich.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That's great.</p>, <p><i>China-U.S. Relations/Taiwan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>China just tested a hypersonic missile. What will you do to keep up with them militarily? And can you vow to protect Taiwan?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes and yes. We are—militarily, China, Russia, and the rest of the world knows we have the most powerful military in the history of the world. Don't worry about whether we're going to—they're going to be more powerful. What you do have to worry about is whether or not they're going to engage in activities that will put them in a position where there—they may make a serious mistake.</p>, <p>And so I have had—I have spoken and spent more time with Xi Jinping than any other world leader has. That's why you have—you know, you hear people saying, ""Biden wants to start a new cold war with China."" I don't want a cold war with China. I just want to make China understand that we are not going to step back. We are not going to change any of our views.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> So are you saying that the United States would come to Taiwan's defense if——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper. —</i>—China attacked?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, we have a commitment to do that.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> All right. We're going to—we're going to take another quick break. We got more questions from the audience. We'll be right back.</p>, <p>[<i>There was a commercial break</i>.]</p>, <p><i>Death of Former Secretary of State General Colin L. Powell </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> And welcome back. We are live with President Joe Biden, here in the city of Baltimore.</p>, <p>Just in the few minutes we have left: The country lost—and I know you lost somebody who you considered close friend, General Colin Powell. What's something about him that people didn't know?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> He had enormous integrity; they knew that. But he's one of the few serious, serious players I've dealt with over these years who, when he made a mistake, he acknowledges it. He said, ""I acknowledge—I was wrong about it.""</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> That's rare these days.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, it's rare. It's been rare—it's rare in human nature for someone in a powerful position to say they are wrong. They are wrong. ""I made a mistake."" That's a hard thing to do. And I've had to do it about a half a dozen times lately. [<i>Laughter</i>] But all kidding aside—and the second thing about him was he had a lot of serious—he had real compassion. You know, his—well, I'll tell you afterwards, but—because we only have a few minutes.</p>, <p>He and I went out to the Secret Service racetrack. He had a brandnew Corvette his family bought—his kids bought him. And I have a '67 327/350, and we raced. We raced. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And you know—you know, the only reason—no, I'm serious. It was on Jay Leno. Check it out. Jay Leno live. He's—he's a hell of a guy.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Who won?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I won only because he was worried I was going to crash into him. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because I don't have positraction, so I was burning rubber the whole way out there, and I could see him going, ""Whoa."" [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> All right. So just—my final question is: You famously—at the signing ceremony, I think it was, for Obamacare, you famously leaned in to the then-President, and—I'm not going to say a direct quote, but—[<i>Laughter</i>]—off-mike, you said, ""This is a big effing deal."" [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And I'm wondering: The Build Back Better plan—is it a bigger effing deal than that? [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Sixty seconds. We got in the car to go over to the—the Department of Education after we did that.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Oh, I thought you were talking about drag racing still. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, no. He got in the car, and he was laughing like hell. I said, ""What's so damn funny?"" And he told me.</p>, <p>I whispered in his ear—this way. I looked to see where it was. I said, ""I'm going to—and this is a big deal."" And I didn't realize the guy behind me was really lipreading. You can see it. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, I'm serious.</p>, <p>The answer is: Yes, this is bigger. No, it is bigger because—not—not because what he did wasn't enormous. He broke the ice. Enormous.</p>, <p>But part of what I have in here is, we also increased access to the Affordable Care Act, and we reduced the price an average of 60 bucks a month for anyone who's in the Affordable Care Act. Plus, on top of that, we have another 300 billion dollars' worth of health care ever—in it.</p>, <p>So it's—I would say this is a bigger darn deal.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Cooper.</i> Mr. President, thank you very much. Appreciate your time.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you very much.</p>]"
5,7,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks at the 10th Anniversary Celebration of the Dedication of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-10th-anniversary-celebration-the-dedication-the-martin-luther-king-jr-memorial,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Thank you, Kamala. Thank you all so very much. Mr. President—[<i>laughter</i>]—Harry, thank you for your stewardship.</p>, <p>You know, here in the heart of the Capital of the United States of America, the tensions and the heart of the Nation are vividly on display. Dr. King stands determined and brave, looking out over the promised land.</p>, <p>Across the Tidal Basin stands another giant of our history: Thomas Jefferson, whose words declared the very idea of America that we are all ""created equal . . . endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights,"" and we all deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.</p>, <p>To state the obvious—and no audience knows it better than this one—we've never fully lived up to that idea. But we've never walked away from it fully. We've never walked away. In his sermon to the March on Washington, Dr. King called on all of America to live up to the full meaning and promise of our Declaration of Independence.</p>, <p>And so they stand here in perpetuity, in timely and timeless conversation that inspires us and challenges us. It reminds us of how far we've come, where we need to go, and how far and how much longer the journey is. And it's a conversation that shapes our days and that we must carry forward.</p>, <p>Madam Vice President, Madam Speaker, Chair of the Black Caucus Beatty, Congressional Black Caucus members, the Memorial Foundation, leaders of faith and community, distinguished guests: From here, we see the ongoing push and pull between progress and struggle over the self-evident truths of our democracy. And in our Nation, we now face an inflection point in the battle, literally, for the soul of America. And it's up to us, together, to choose who we want to be and what we want to be.</p>, <p>I know the progress does not come fast enough. It never has. And the process of governing is frustrating and sometimes dispiriting. But I also know what's possible if we keep the pressure up, if we never give up, if we keep the faith.</p>, <p>We're at an inflection point—as I know I've maybe overused that phrase, but it is an inflection point in American history—in delivering on economic justice. For it was the dignity of work that Dr. King was in Memphis on that fateful day in April, helping sanitation workers, not only for better pay and safer conditions, but to be granted more dignity as human beings.</p>, <p>In our time, it's about recognizing that for much too long we've allowed a narrowed and cramped view of the promise of America, a view that America is a zero-sum game, particularly of the recent past. ""If you succeed, I fail."" ""If you get ahead, I fall behind."" And maybe worst of all, ""If I can hold you down, I lift myself up."" Instead of what it should be—and it's just self-evident—""If you do well, we all do well."" That's keeping the promise of America. I've never seen a time when working folks did well that the wealthy didn't do very well.</p>, <p>Look, it's the core of our administration's economic vision, and it's a fundamental paradigm shift for this Nation. For the first time in a couple generations, we're going to be investing in working families, putting them first and helping them get ahead, rather than the wealthy and the biggest and most powerful people out there.</p>, <p>We're investing in Black families with rescue checks and tax cuts that will reduce Black poverty by 34 percent—Black child poverty by more than 50 percent—this year. And we're aggressively—with the leadership with of the people I'm looking at right now—combating housing discrimination to create a generation of wealth. How did every other person make it to the middle class from a working-class circumstance? Just like my dad did, build equity in a house—granted, it was small; granted, it wasn't much, but it was enough to build a little equity.</p>, <p>We'll use the Federal Government's purchasing power to unlock billions of dollars in new opportunities of minority-owned small businesses and access to Government contracts. Is there any doubt that providing more people with just a little more breathing room to take care of their families, generate a little bit of wealth that they can pass on to their children, and create jobs in their communities would uplift the entire country—all the country? Everyone.</p>, <p>And as the economy recovers, we are determined and focused on rebuilding it over the long run. No one should have to hold their breath as they cross a rundown bridge to determine whether it's safe enough or a dangerous intersection in their hometown.</p>, <p>A nation—every American, every child should be able to turn on a faucet and drink water that's not contaminated by lead or anything else.</p>, <p>As a nation, everyone should have access to affordable high-speed internet. Gone the days when you have to pull up to a McDonald's and sit in a parking lot with your child to do their homework when there's virtual learning going on.</p>, <p>Dr. King said, ""Of all the forms of inequity, injustice in health care is the most shocking and most inhumane."" This is a once-in-a-century pandemic that's hit this country hard and especially the African American community.</p>, <p>It's likely you've all lost someone to the virus or know someone who has lost a loved one. One in six hundred Black Americans have died from COVID-19. It's been reported that Black children are more than twice as likely as white children to have lost a parent or a caregiver to COVID-19, to have to experience the trauma and loss.</p>, <p>Many of my colleagues in the Congress are working on—what we have to now work on even more fervently—and that is mental health care, helping people through the difficult periods we have. It's been devastating, but we can find purpose in pain. We can find purpose in this pain.</p>, <p>Equity is the center of my administration's COVID-19 response. The vaccination rates among Black adults is now essentially on par with White adults. In the midst of this pandemic, we're building on the Affordable Care Act to extend coverage to lower health care costs for millions of Black families.</p>, <p>We're also working on lowering prescription drug costs by giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices. And how do you know the plan will work? Because the drug companies are spending millions of bucks to try to stop it. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's how you know. Together, we're making health care a right, not a privilege, in this Nation.</p>, <p>And for the millions—the millions of you—who feel financially squeezed in raising a child while caring for an aging parent, the so-called sandwich generation, we want to make eldercare affordable and accessible so your aging loved ones can live with greater independence and dignity.</p>, <p>We also want to make sure childcare costs for most families are cut at least in half. No working family—if we get what you all are helping me get done—no working family in America will pay more than 7 percent of their income on childcare for any child under 5.</p>, <p>We want to give raises to millions of care workers and home workers so they can increase their capacity, increase their knowledge, increase their opportunities. Health workers and childcare workers are disproportionately women—women of color and immigrants—workers, like the ones Dr. King stood for when he marched and gave his life.</p>, <p>Look, folks, just imagine, instead of consigning millions of our children to underresourced schools, we gave every single child in America access to an education at age 3 and age 4, quality preschool. We can afford to do this. We can't afford not to do it.</p>, <p>And we do know, no matter what the background or circumstance a child comes from, when given that opportunity, they have a better than 58-percent chance of making it all the way through 12 years without getting themselves in trouble and maybe going beyond that.</p>, <p>This will change lives forever. So will historic investments in higher education: significantly increasing Pell grants to help millions of Black students in lower income families attend community colleges and 4-year schools.</p>, <p>I tell you, let me be clear: In the shadow of the Morehouse men—I hear a lot about that, guys—[<i>laughter</i>]—and with a Howard alumna—[<i>laughter</i>]—I keep making the case—""if you'd excuse the point of personal privilege,"" as we used to say in the Senate—the best HBCU in the country is Delaware State. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's where I got started. Come on.</p>, <p>But here's what we've done—in addition to putting the president of Delaware State, who used to work for me—Doctor—he—in charge of all of this—we're committed to nearly $5 billion this year in historic investments, with more, in Historically Black Colleges and Universities to make every single student—give them a shot with good-paying jobs.</p>, <p>And you all know what I mean, but for anybody watching this: One of the problems is, Black students in colleges just have every single capability any other student does, but guess what? Because they don't have great endowments, they can't compete for those Government contracts that are out there that the big schools are able to go out and get. Cybersecurity, for example, starting salary is 100-, 125,000 bucks. But you don't get to get that contract unless you have laboratories, unless you have the facilities you can, in fact, train on.</p>, <p>We also know this about the promise of America. Economic injustice also means delivering environmental justice to communities on—fenceline communities, dividing homes in toxic areas. My State has one of the highest cancer rates in the history of America—in America. Because I lived in a fenceline community called Claymont, Delaware. We used to get up in the morning—not a joke—and I'd get driven to the little school I went, up the street; turn on the windshield wiper in the fall, the first frost, and literally, there'd be an oil slick on the window. Not a joke. An oil slick on the window. It's why an awful lot of us, including me, have bronchial asthma.</p>, <p>It means reducing pollution so our children can develop and avoid these consequences. Every one of you have an alley in your State; we call it ""Cancer Alley"" in our State, going down Route 13.</p>, <p>Look, it means building up our resilience to the climate crisis or the next extreme weather events. And these have been of biblical proportions—biblical proportions. A-hundred-seventy-eight-mile top winds in a hurricane down in Louisiana. More people dying in Queens, in their basements, because 20 inches of rain—they flooded and couldn't get out of their basements; they drowned. Superstorms, droughts, wildfire, hurricanes.</p>, <p>This is the promise for America: urban and rural and all across America, not just for any one area. And as we fight for economic justice to fulfill the promise of America for all Americans, the work continues on delivering equal justice under the law.</p>, <p>Look, I know the frustration we all feel that more than 1 year after George Floyd's murder and the conviction of his murderer about 6 months ago, meaningful police reform in George's name has not passed Congress. I remember many times meeting with his little daughter. And she'd say to me: ""My daddy is changing history. He's going to change history."" But we haven't fulfilled that yet.</p>, <p>I understand. We've got to keep fighting. But let me be clear though: We're going to continue to fight for real police reform legislation, and the fight is not anywhere near over.</p>, <p>Despite Republican obstruction, my administration is acting. We've already announced changes to the Federal law enforcement policies: a ban on choke holds, restriction on no-knock warrants, requirements that Federal agents wear and activate body cameras, ending Department of Justice use of private prisons, rescinding the previous administration's guidance to U.S. attorneys to require the harshest of penalties.</p>, <p>The Justice Department has opened a pattern-or-practice investigation of systematic police misconduct in police departments in Phoenix, Louisville, and Minneapolis. Just because we can't get it done in the States, we are not standing back. And we have much more to do.</p>, <p>In addition to these important steps, my administration also wants to advance some meaningful police reform that includes additional Executive actions to live up to America's promise of equal justice under the law.</p>, <p>Our work continues to create safer and stronger communities in critical ways. With my American Rescue Plan—and thank you in the Congress for supporting it—everybody kind of forgets that was $1.9 billion—trillion dollars. We've got a hell of—heck of a lot done with that. [<i>Laughter</i>] That—it did so well, people don't even know where it came from. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, I'm serious. Think about it.</p>, <p>Like, ""What did you do for me lately?"" Well, we had $1.9 billion [trillion]* we took care of.</p>, <p><i>Vice President Harris.</i> Trillion! Trillion!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, we made historic investments in community policing and violence intervention programs and were shown to reduce—some of these programs reduce violence by 60 percent.</p>, <p>We're expanding summer programs and job opportunities and service and support to keep young people safe and out of trouble.</p>, <p>We're helping formerly incarcerated people successfully reenter their communities. In the past, you'd get 25 bucks and a bus ticket. And you'd go back right under the bridge you just were there before. You should have access to Pell grants. You should have access to the—housing. You should have access to all the things. You paid your price. And we shouldn't put back in the spot where you have no options.</p>, <p>We're also working to stem the flow of firearms from rogue gun dealers to curb the epidemic of gun violence. I know I get criticized for being the guy who passed the assault weapons ban. I'm proud of having passed the assault weapons ban.</p>, <p>But here's the deal: We heard Dr. King paraphrase Micah. He said, ""Give us the ballot, and we will place judges on the benches of the South who will do justly and love mercy."" Well, in just 9 months, we have appointed more Black women to the Federal circuit courts and more former public defenders to the bench than any administration in all of American history—because of you. We're going to change it.</p>, <p>And we did it in record time, and we're just getting started, because of all of you in the audience here. You've been the engine behind all of this.</p>, <p>But we also know this: To make real the full promise of America, we have to protect that fundamental right: the right to vote—the sacred right to vote. You know, it's democracy's threshold of liberty. With it, anything is possible. Without it, nothing is.</p>, <p>Today, the right to vote and the rule of law are under unrelenting assault from Republican Governors, attorneys general, secretaries of State, State legislators. And they're following my predecessor—the last President—into a deep, deep black hole and abyss.</p>, <p>No, I really mean it. Think about it. That's what got me involved in civil rights as a kid, when I was 26 years old. It gave me—I had never planned—I love reading about how ""Biden knew he was going to run President."" Hell, I didn't know I was even going to be able to run for the county council; I didn't even want to. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But look, this struggle is no longer just over who gets to vote or making it easier for eligible people to vote. It's about who gets to count the votes—whether they should count at all. Jim Crow in the 21st century is now a sinister combination of voter suppression and elective subversion—election subversion.</p>, <p>My fellow Americans, I thought, at one point, that I had been able to do something good as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I was able to get every member of the committee, including some of the most conservative Members that ever served—clearly who had racist backgrounds—to vote to extend the Voting Rights Act for 25 years. I thought, ""Whoa."" One of the proudest things I ever did as a Senator.</p>, <p>But guess what? This means that some State legislatures want to make it harder for you to vote. And if you do vote, they want to be able to tell you whether or not your vote counts. That's not happened before.</p>, <p>They want the ability to reject the final vote and ignore the will of the people if their preferred candidate—Black or White or Asian or Latino, doesn't matter—if that—if their candidate doesn't win. And they're targeting not just voters of color, as I said, but every voter who doesn't vote the way they want.</p>, <p>I have to admit to you, having been as Senator in my whole of 36-year career involved in—I worked with a lot of folks out here on civil rights issues—I thought, ""Man, you can't turn this back."" I'd bet you could defeat hate. What if we could actually defeat hate?</p>, <p>But the most un-American thing that any of us can imagine—the most undemocratic and the most unpatriotic, and yet sadly, not unprecedented—time and again, we've witnessed threats to the right to vote in free and fair elections come to fruition. Each time, we fought back. And we've got to continue to fight back today.</p>, <p>I want to thank Martin Luther King III for leading marches on voting rights during the anniversary of the March on Washington on August 28.</p>, <p>The Vice President and I, and our colleagues here, have spent our careers doing this work. It's central to our administration.</p>, <p>On the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I directed each and every Federal agency to promote access to voting from each agency heeding that call. For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs, I asked them to make it easier for veterans and their families to register and to vote at VA facilities so it'd be open. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice has doubled the voting rights enforcement staff.</p>, <p>We've got a long way to go though. It's using authorities to challenge the onslaught of State laws undermining voting rights, whether in old or new ways.</p>, <p>To something like 20 percent of the—or half the Republicans—the registered Republicans: I am not your President; Donald Trump is still your President. As we Catholics say, ""Oh, my God."" [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But look, the focus is going to remain on discrimination and racial discriminatory laws—Georgia's various [vicious]* new antivoting laws. And let's be clear about Georgia—Dr. King's home State and the home State of someone who has literally stood in his shoes as——</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, a jet could be heard flying overhead.</i>]</p>, <p>——I think some of you guys knew this was—the next line was coming; that's why you had the jets come out—[<i>laughter</i>]—stood in his shoes as a Morehouse man. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what I keep getting from Cedric. Oh, anyway. [<i>Laughter</i>] And as a preacher in the pulpit of Ebenezer—United States Senator Raphael Warnock, the first Black Senator in Georgia's history.</p>, <p>Senator Warnock won his election in the battle of ideas. He earned the trust and confidence of a broad coalition of voters in Georgia. And the response of Republicans in Georgia, what was it? It's not to try winning on the merits and ideas, it's by changing the rules to make it harder for people to vote, deny the franchise.</p>, <p>The Vice President has been leading our administration's efforts. And we've supported Democrats pressing to enact critical voting rights bills since day one of this administration, making sure we have unanimous support. But each and every time, the Senate Republicans block it by refusing even to talk about it. They're afraid to even just debate the bills in the U.S. Senate, as they did again yesterday, even on a bill that includes provisions that they've traditionally supported. It's unfair, it's unconscionable, and it's un-American.</p>, <p>And this battle is far from over. The door has not been closed. The John Lewis Voting Rights Act will soon come up for a vote—named after our dear friend we still miss dearly, but whose voice we hear every day in our hearts and in our conscience.</p>, <p>It's a law that helped lead the reauthorization—as I said, for 25 years that I served of the—in the Senate Judiciary Committee—expanding the Voting Rights Act. It's traditionally received bipartisan support. We have to keep up the fight and get it done. And I know the moment we're in; you know the moment we are in. I know the stakes; you know the stakes. This is far from over.</p>, <p>And finally, we're confronting the stains of what remains—the deep stain on the soul of the nation: hate and White supremacy. You know, there's a through line of subjugation and enslaved people from our earliest days to the reigns of radicalized terror of the KKK to Dr. King being assassinated. And through that—and though that line continues to be the torches emerging from dark shadows in Charlottesville, carrying out Nazi banners and chanting anti-Semitic bile, and Ku Klux Klan flags; and the violent, deadly insurrection on the Capitol 9 months ago—it was about White supremacy, in my view.</p>, <p>The rise of hate crimes against Asian Americans during the pandemic and the rise of anti-Semitism here in America and around the world.</p>, <p>The through line is that hate never goes away. It never—I thought—in all of the years I've been involved, I thought once we got through it, it would go away. But it doesn't; it only hides. It only hides until some seeming-legitimate person breathes some oxygen under the rocks where they're hiding and gives it some breath.</p>, <p>I've said it before—and all my colleagues here know it—according to the United States intelligence community, domestic terrorism from White supremacists is the most lethal terrorist threat in the homeland. To that end, our administration is carrying out the first-ever comprehensive effort to tackle the threat—passed by domestic—posed by domestic terrorism, including White supremacy.</p>, <p>We are doing so by taking action to reduce online radicalism and recruitment to violence. We're also disrupting networks that inspire violence and domestic terrorists by providing resources to communities to build resilience. We cannot and must not give hate any safe harbor—any safe harbor.</p>, <p>My fellow Americans, standing here I'm reminded of the goal of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which Dr. King led. And I quote—he said his goal was to, quote, ""redeem the soul of America."" That's what's at stake here: the soul of America.</p>, <p>And we know that it's not the work of a single day or a single administration or even a single generation. But here we stand with Dr. King to show: Out of struggle there is progress; out of despair there is hope. From the promise of equality and opportunity, of jobs, justice, and freedom, we see Black excellence, American excellence, Black history as American history and a defining source of the might of this Nation.</p>, <p>That's why we're here to today: to renew our own courage in the shadow, in the light, and on the shoulders of Dr. King, Coretta Scott King, and all those known and unknown who gave their whole souls to this work.</p>, <p>The courage to confront wrong and to try do right. The courage to heal the broken places in the nation. The courage to see America whole, to acknowledge where we fall short, to devote ourselves to the perfection of the Union that we love and we must protect.</p>, <p>For if we can summon the courage to do these things, we'll have done our duty, honored our commitments, and brought the dream of Dr. King just a little bit closer to reality. It's the highest of callings. It's the most sacred of charges. And it's what, with the help of God, we can do now.</p>, <p>So let's go forth from this sacred place—of tumult and turmoil—with the hope and promise of a nation always seeking, always thriving, always keeping the faith. Because, folks—you know, I know my colleagues in the Senate used to always kid me for quoting Irish poets on the floor. They thought I did it because I was Irish. It's not the reason; they're the just the best poets in the world. [<i>Laughter</i>] There's a line from the—and I believe this to be true. There's a line from a poem, ""The Cure at Troy""—and it says that ""once in a lifetime that tidal wave of justice rises up, and hope and history rhyme."" That's not the whole quote. I won't bore you with it all. But ""hope and history rhyme.""</p>, <p>I believe the American people—the vast majority—are with us. I think they see much more clearly what you've all been fighting for your whole lives now. It's in stark relief.</p>, <p>The bad news: We had a President who appealed to the prejudice. The good news is that he took the—he ripped the Band-Aid off, made it absolutely clear what's at stake. And I think the American people will follow us. But guess what? Whether they will or not, we have no choice. We have to continue to fight.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.</p>]"
5,8,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks in Scranton, Pennsylvania",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-scranton-pennsylvania,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Hello, hello, hello. It's good to be home. Thank you all. Please, please be seated.</p>, <p>I just want you to know we have a tradition in the Biden-Finnegan family: When you see a relative, you go see them first. These are my relatives in the front row here, I want you to know.</p>, <p>And I spent an awful lot of time across from St. Paul's Church at my Uncle Jack Finnegan's house. His daughters are here. And he was—he taught up at ""The U.""</p>, <p>And I just want you to know that Amtrak is here. They can tell you that you could—that you should name half the line after me. [<i>Laughter</i>] I am most railroad guy you ever going to meet: 2,100,000 miles on Amtrak. Hear me now? Not a joke.</p>, <p>What happened was, when you are a President or a Vice President, they keep meticulous mileage of when you fly an Air Force aircraft. And so, about—I guess it was 7 years in to my tenure as Vice President. And I used to always like to take Amtrak home on Friday. My mom—I'd try to go home and see my mom, who was living with us at the time after my dad passed, and I'd try to get home.</p>, <p>And the Secret Service are wonderful. They're the best in the world. They never liked me taking Amtrak because it stops too often, and too many people get on, and you don't know. And—but I often—there was a—but I—it turned out I was about number three in seniority on the road at the time, if you did—well, in terms of the actual time on the road.</p>, <p>And a lot of the folks in Amtrak became my family. Not a joke. I'd ride every day. I commuted every single day for 36 years as President—Vice President of the United States. After my wife and daughter were killed, I went home to see my family and never stopped going—doing that.</p>, <p>And so Angelo Negri was from—you remember Ange? Ange came up to me one day when I was—when they just had announced that I had flown 1 million some—x-number of miles on Air Force aircraft. And Ange comes up, and I'm getting into the car, and he goes: ""Joey, baby. What do you""—[<i>laughter</i>]—and I thought the Secret Service was going to shoot him. [<i>Laughter</i>] I said: ""No, no, no, no. He's good. He's good."" It's a true story.</p>, <p>And he said, ""I just read—big deal. Big deal""—whatever is was—""1,200,000 miles—Air Force. You know how many miles you did Amtrak?"" And I said, ""No, Ange. I don't have any idea, pal."" He said: ""Let me tell you. We were at the retirement dinner."" And he said: ""We added it up. You averaged a hundred—I think it says—twenty-one days a year. One hundred and twenty-one days. Your 36 years, plus as Vice President. Boom, boom. You have traveled over 2 million miles, Joe. I don't want to hear any more about the Air Force."" [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But in the Build Back Better plan, I got more money for passenger rail than the entire Amtrak system cost to begin with. We're going to change the nation in a big way.</p>, <p>Shane, I want to thank you for the introduction. I really do.</p>, <p>And Madam Mayor, Paige, you've done a great job—a great, great job—no, I really mean it. I'm a big fan. And I—she—I—when I got elected—this is the God's truth—after I checked on what the margin was in the State of Delaware, I called up here. [<i>Laughter</i>] She had won that year too. And I found out that I won every precinct in Scranton. And I looked up and said, ""Mom, I did it."" [<i>Laughter</i>] ""I did it.""</p>, <p>Look, and it's great to be here. It's great to be here in Pennsylvania with a very close friend—become a close friend—and a great Governor, Governor Wolf. It's good to see you, Gov.</p>, <p>And, Matt, thank you for the passport to let me back into the district. [<i>Laughter</i>] And you know—you know, we—it's interesting. I grew up not very far from Bobby, where—excuse me, the Senator—where he grew up is about a total of—if you add it up, I think it's about five blocks, six blocks.</p>, <p>And his dad and I were about 18 years apart, and we're 17 years apart, so it's like a continuum going on here. But I just want you to know: We went to the same schools, same parish—just a few years apart—give a few, take a few years.</p>, <p>And Scranton is where I played shortstop with the Green Ridge Little League in the first year that it was put up. My dad helped build the field down there. And spent a lot of time at Simmey's, buying penny candy, and Hanks Hoagies on Woodlawn Street, watching movies at the ""Roosie"" on the weekend. And trying to reenact all they did, and—when you watched those movies.</p>, <p>I think—and I was told—I don't know that it's true—I was the only kid in my year that I was able to walk across the ""Lacky"" on that pipe that was just above the thing. If you fell in the Lacky, you were a lackey. [<i>Laughter</i>] You were in trouble. But—at any rate—[<i>laughter</i>]——</p>, <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That's right.</p>, <p>Look, no matter how long you live here in Scranton, it's a place that climbs into your heart and it never really leaves you. And that's the God's truth. You know, it's like that old saying goes, ""You can take the boy out of Scranton, but you can't take Scranton out of the boy."" There's something special about it. And I believe that home is where your character is etched, and I really mean that.</p>, <p>Some of you have heard me say this before. It's where your view of the world begins, and where you begin, and where it takes shape. And that happened to me in 2446 North Washington Avenue.</p>, <p>We used to come back after 10:30 mass at St. Paul's—St. Clare's wasn't built till I had moved—at St Paul's, and my grandfather would hold court. And back in those days, all the men had breakfast in the kitchen. My mother was one of five children and four brothers. One was lost in World War II. And a guy who was the chief political reporter at the newspaper, Tommy Phillips, who was—lived on the street behind us—he was a good friend of my grandfather's.</p>, <p>And all the women would go into the dining room and, on the lace tablecloth, and have tea. [<i>Laughter</i>] And the men would, in fact, have a big breakfast. And if you were a kid, if you're a young boy, you could sort of wander around the table. You can never sit at the table. And so I used to, every once in a while, walk in and just sort of wander around. I'd stand by my grandpop, and I'd put my hand on his shoulder, and I—they talked. And they talked about everything from sports and politics, and that's where—I learned an awful lot at that kitchen table.</p>, <p>I learned from my grandpop that money doesn't determine your worth. I learned, and—he told me, and it's not a joke—those of you who know, we know it to be true, and you guys know it—is that, ""No one in the world is more worthy than you, Joey, but everyone is your equal; everybody is your equal."" My mom would remind me, she said, ""Joey, this is the God's truth. Remember you're defined by your courage, and you're redeemed by your loyalty."" You're defined by your courage, and you're redeemed by your loyalty.</p>, <p>And my dad—when things got tough in Scranton after the war, when there wasn't any work, my dad did not work in the coal mines—my great-grandfather was a mining engineer, but my dad was in sales, and he worked for the—[<i>inaudible</i>]—trucking company. And things got slow in Scranton, so we moved.</p>, <p>I remember the day he came—I think the longest walk a parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to tell their kid: ""You can't live here anymore. You can't because we—Dad has—Dad doesn't have a job""—or ""Mom don't have a job."" And my dad had moved from Wilmington, Delaware, to Scranton when he was a senior in high—a junior in high school. He went—then, it was called St. Thomas—not the Prep, but it was called St. Thomas in those days.</p>, <p>And I remember him walking up in—into the bedroom and saying, ""Honey, I'm going to—Dad's going to have to move. I'm going to—but I'm—it's going to probably take about a year. I'll come home every single weekend. It's only 155 miles."" I thought that was like 600 miles away. ""I'll come home every weekend."" But—""And when, I get enough—we get enough money, I'm going to bring you and Mom and everyone down to Wilmington. You're going to like it.""</p>, <p>And I thought that was like—and you know, an awful lot of parents who left Scranton back in those days, who moved away—had to move away. And you know, I gained so much respect from my father as I got older because I thought about how much it would—how much it must have hurt him and the pride it took for him to walk into my grandfather's pantry and say: ""Ambrose, is it—can I leave Jean and the kids with you? I promise I'll make it up to you. But I'll be back every weekend. But I promise I'll make it up."" That's a hard thing for a proud man or woman to do. But so many had to do it.</p>, <p>And I remember when we moved down to Delaware and my dad would say, ""Joey""—and all my friends know this—I mean, literally, this phrase—you've heard him say it I don't know how many times—""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay.'"" And think about it. Think about what it is: It means a lot more than just whether you get a paycheck. It defines who you are, in his mind.</p>, <p>And I learned that at the kitchen table in Scranton—the place where you take care of one another. And as I said, my mother—I used to stutter badly when I was a kid. If Tommy Bell and Charlie Roth and all of my old friends were here at St. Paul's, you know, I—my nickname was ""Blackbird."" It was, ""Bi-bi-bi-blackbird."" It wasn't meant as a compliment. And I wasn't very big, but—you could beat me, but I'd hurt you. [<i>Laughter</i>] You think I'm kidding; I'm not.</p>, <p>And—but you know, it's one of those things that—I was fortunate, because the people I was surrounded by—our neighbors in Scranton, as well—that people—people stuck up for you—stuck up for one another. And my mother used to say—and I never quite understood it: ""Remember, Joey, look at me—look at me, Joey. You're a Biden."" I'm—like I'm a DuPont or something. You know what I mean? [<i>Laughter</i>] I swear to God. ""You're a Biden. Nobody is better than you, and everybody is equal to you. Nobody.""</p>, <p>The point I'm making is: The truth is, Scranton isn't my home because of the memories it gave me; it's my home because of the values it gave me. So, when I ran for President, I came back to Scranton. I came back to Scranton. And I started here in Scranton. And I resolved to bring Scranton values to bear, to make a fundamental shift in how our economy works for working people, to build the economy from the ground up and the middle out and not from the top down. I've never known a time when the middle class has done well and the wealthy haven't done very, very well. I've never known such a time.</p>, <p>So I'm here today to talk about what's fundamentally at stake right now for the families and for our country. For most of the 20th century, we led the world by a significant margin because we invested in our people. We invested in ourselves—not only in our roads and our highways and our bridges, but in our people, in our families. We didn't just build an Interstate Highway System, we built a highway to the sky, to outer space. We were also—we invested to win the space race, and we won.</p>, <p>We were also among the first to provide access to free education, beginning back in the late 1800s, early 1900s. We invested in our children. Does anybody think today, if we were making that decision for the first time, we'd say, ""Twelve years is enough in the 21st century""? ""Twelve years is enough""? It's not. But back then, they did, and it's the reason why we leapt ahead of the rest of the world. Not a joke. We became among the best educated countries in the world.</p>, <p>But somewhere along the way, we stopped investing in ourselves. America is still the largest economy in the world. We still have the most productive workers in the world, the most innovative minds. But we risk losing our edge as a nation.</p>, <p>You know, our infrastructure used to be the best in the world—not a joke—the best in the world. Today, according to the World Economic Forum, we rank 13th in the world in terms of infrastructure: our roads, bridges, highways, internet, the whole works. Thirteenth in the world.</p>, <p>We used to lead the world in educational achievement. Today, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Europe ranks America 35 out of 37 major companies [countries]* when it comes to investing in early childhood education.</p>, <p>And talk about an equalizer—the greatest equalizer in the world. One of the great universities has done studies in the last 15 years: You give a kid, no matter what the kid's background—from a broken home, from a home where mom or dad didn't go to school or whatever—and you put them in school—third grade, you increase by 50—school, not daycare—you increase by 56 percent the chance that they'll complete 12 years of school and build confidence.</p>, <p>What's education all about? It's about building confidence in a child. It's about giving the tools to do something.</p>, <p>We can't be competitive in the 21st-century economy if we continue to slide the way we have. That's why I resolved that we have to, once again, build America from the bottom up and the middle out. Again, not the top down.</p>, <p>And by the way, I'm a capitalist. I think if you can be a millionaire or a billionaire, fine. Just do your fair share. Just do your fair share. You know, trickle-down economics has always failed. It hadn't built this country. You know who built this country—like the young man who just introduced me: union people. People who, in fact, can make a decent, hard wage and build the country.</p>, <p>I'm not—it's not hyperbole. I mean it from the bottom of my heart. That's why I proposed two critical pieces of legislation that are being debated back in Washington.</p>, <p>Now, there's some really smart national press with me today, and they have understandably believed that there's no possibility of my getting this done. This had been declared ""dead on arrival"" from the moment I introduced it. But I think we're going to surprise them, because I think people are beginning to figure out what's at stake.</p>, <p>You know, when I use the phrase ""build back better,"" it's being used internationally now. I got the G-7—the largest countries in the world—to agree that we're going to have a Build Back Better World. And we're going to invest, and we're going to build around the world, give democracies an ability so the rest of the countries don't fall prey to those like the Belt and Road Initiative out of China and other initiatives where there's, ""I'll do something for you if you give me""—if you give me.</p>, <p>Folks, look, these bills are not about left versus right or about moderate versus progressive or anything that pits one American against one another. These bills are about competitiveness versus complacency. They're about expanding opportunity, not having opportunity denied. They're about leading the world and continuing to let the world—or let it pass us by.</p>, <p>And by the way, they will not increase one single penny of the deficit. They are fully paid for. And all of Wall Street points out they will grow employment by tens of thousands of people—tens of thousands of people. Seventeen Nobel laureates spontaneously—Nobel laureates in economy—in the economy—sent me a letter 3 weeks ago saying it will also reduce, not increase inflation.</p>, <p>Here's what these initiatives are all about. First, the infrastructure bill. When I say ""infrastructure"" back home, people look like: ""Infrastructure? What the hell you talking about, Joe?"" They know infrastructure generically. But it's about rebuilding the arteries of our economy. That's what it's about.</p>, <p>Across this country right now, there are 45,000 bridges, according to the society of engineers—45,000—a significant portion that are ready to fall. Fall. Fall into the water or into the gap that they cover. There are 173 [thousand]* miles of roads in poor conditions that have to be built up, including more than 3,300 bridges and over 7,500 miles of highways here in the State of Pennsylvania that need to be repaired and built. Increased timing and commerce.</p>, <p>We're going to put hard-working Americans on the job to bring our infrastructure up to speed, good union jobs—not $7 an hour or $15 an hour, but prevailing wage—a wage you can raise your family on, you can look at your family with pride; jobs that can't be outsourced; jobs replacing lead water pipes, like you have here in the Scranton area.</p>, <p>Kids are getting brain damage because of the ingestion of lead. Clean water all across America. We're going to replace every single lead pipe in the Nation, again, creating jobs but doing more than that: increasing the health and well-being of our children. Forty-four thousand schools are in a position where they have lead pipes. You send your kid to the water fountain, you've got to wonder about it.</p>, <p>Jobs laying thousands of miles of transmission lines and building a modern energy grid. Folks, we're in a situation now where you see what's happening. I've flown all over this country since coming in. You realize more of our land has been burned to the ground—burned to the ground in the West and in the Northwest than the entire State of New Jersey? Every single square mile in New Jersey—more has been burned down this year—this year—in the West because of climate change and because of electric utilities failing, wires falling.</p>, <p>We know if we can put these wires underground, we increase exponentially the service, but it costs a lot of money. We have to do it. We know that if we, in fact, allow people to be able to store—we have this incredible energy.</p>, <p>We have—I've visited one of the largest solar fields in America. It's in the Southwest. Guess what? You can transmit all that energy, enough to really light up half the—half of the State of Nevada. But guess what? How do you transmit it? What lines do you put it over? Do we have the capacity to do that? We have the engineering capacity, but do we have the will to do it? And imagine what that does.</p>, <p>You realize we had $90 billion in loss this calendar year because of natural disasters? Ninety billion dollars.</p>, <p>Jobs. Making sure there's high-speed internet, affordable and available anywhere, everywhere in America, including for nearly one in six families who go without internet. They're kind of—you saw what's happened when we've had this COVID.</p>, <p>Try teaching from home. How many people did you see out in McDonald's parking lots with their kids in their cars—because they get access to the internet—to be able to help the kid in school? What are we doing? This is the United States of America, dammit. What are we doing?</p>, <p>And both these bills are going to help us meet the moment on the climate crisis in a way that creates good jobs, makes us more economically competitive.</p>, <p>Sixty-six billion dollars in passenger rail and freight rail. Why do I always talk about passenger rail, and particularly high-speed rail? You realize the Chinese are now building another high-speed rail line that will go up to 300 miles per hour? You say, ""What difference does that make, Biden?"" Well, guess what? If you can get in a train and go from here to Washington much faster than you can go in an automobile, you take a train. You take the train. We will take literally millions of automobiles off the road—off the road—saving tens of millions of barrels of oil, dealing with cleaning up the air.</p>, <p>This is not hyperbole, this is a fact. These are facts. Right now, when I went out to Silicon Valley, they showed we're in a situation where if you put solar panels on your roof—guess what?—when the sun is not shining, you're in trouble, except they have now battery technology. You can have batteries in your basement, about the size of the width of this podium and about that thick, that will keep you going for 7 days.</p>, <p>So what do we have in this legislation? We have $39 billion to modernize American transit.</p>, <p>I remember riding the trolley. I lived at the end of the line, as they say, in Green Ridge. Three blocks—the end of the line. And beyond the end of the line were the dumps. And Maloney field was on the right. And the Little League Baseball field I played in was down in the bottom of the hill.</p>, <p>But the point is: It made to work. Most people live in cities. You know, the vast majority of people now—working people—live in cities; their jobs are out of town, no longer in town. No longer in town. But 65 percent do not own an automobile. They live in a Black or Hispanic neighborhood or a poor neighborhood. And all the time they waste trying to get to work.</p>, <p>Look, more than $7 billion to build out the national network of electric vehicle charging stations.</p>, <p>The way my grandpop got up here—my Grandpop Biden, who died at Mercy Hospital of an aneurysm when he was 46 years old, 2 months before I was born in Mercy Hospital—he was with the American Oil Company. He was up here opening up gas stations in nineteen—that's how he got here. This was 1942—late '42.</p>, <p>Well, guess what? The same thing happens. We build these charging stations, what happens? Communities build up around them. You get everything from the figurative McDonald's or the Dunkin' Donuts to the drugstore.</p>, <p>And $21 billion for environmental cleanup and remediation. Look, it means putting people to work in a good job, prevailing wages, capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned wells in Southeastern Pennsylvania and in Ohio. Get the same salary that you paid the mine worker to dig the well. They've got to be capped. We have thousands of them that need to be capped.</p>, <p>In addition to that, we have methane leaks that are all over. And you all understand in Pennsylvania about that. But guess what? It increases the health of the community and provides good-paying jobs.</p>, <p>My plan also makes a historic investment in clean energy, including a tax credit for people to do things like winterize their homes, install solar panels, develop clean energy products, help businesses produce more clean energy. It's real, I promise you.</p>, <p>I won't be around to see it, but I promise you: Your kids are going to see a time when they're not, in fact, generating any energy from the homes here in Scranton other than renewable energy. Not a joke.</p>, <p>And by the way, one of the things the President put me in charge of my—I want to be clear here—[<i>laughter</i>]—President Obama put me in charge of when I was Vice President—I was able to invest in that legislation that we put together—I put together. We brought down the price of the—of solar and wind cheaper than coal and cheaper than oil on a BTU basis. It's cheaper.</p>, <p>Coal built this town and this part of the country, but we've got to provide other avenues for people to make the same of kind of living they used to be able to make.</p>, <p>Look, all told—I just said this project is going to save, literally, hundreds of millions of barrels of oil annually. But folks here in Pennsylvania know the cost of inaction when it comes to climate change. Extreme weather has cost this State $10 billion over the last decade. And nationally, as I said, extreme weather conditions cost $99 billion last year.</p>, <p>And I flew over all this territory in helicopter—in Marine One—not a joke—to see it. See reservoirs that are down 60, 80 feet. Concern about the Colorado River, whether or not we're going to be able to keep things moving. Not a joke. It's real. This is serious stuff.</p>, <p>And so, you know, it's not going to ease up on its own. We have to invest in our resilience, building roads higher. We came—when I say, ""build back better,"" we're the only country in the world, historically, that's gone through a crisis and has come out at the other end better than before the crisis hit. That's who we are as Americans. Not a joke. Think about it.</p>, <p>For those if you who teach history, think about it: We come out better than it was before, because we don't give up. We invest. We trust our instincts. And so that's what I'm talking about. You know, we need more—stronger levees; stronger power grids, more durable, able to withstand the ever-increasing ferocity and intensity of extreme weather.</p>, <p>Any road—it used to be, if you have a catastrophe and the road gets washed out, you build it back to what it was before. You can't build it back to the same standard. You've got to build the road back literally higher—not a joke—because the weather has already changed. And if we don't do something before we reach 1.5 degrees Celsius, we're in trouble.</p>, <p>Look, I haven't passed—we haven't passed a major infrastructure bill for decades in this country. The last 4 years, you'd hear—every month was, you know, ""Infrastructure Month."" Didn't do a single, damn thing. Nothing. I mean nothing for 4 years. We can't afford to sit while other countries pass us by. We're going to breathe new life into the economy and our workforce.</p>, <p>And here's the deal: These jobs will create—that we're going to create for people who are too often left out and left behind. The vast majority of the jobs in my infrastructure bill don't require a 4-year degree; 98 percent don't require a 4-year degree.</p>, <p>Guess what, though? This is the ultimate blue-collar—blue-collar, middle class renewal; real serious work that needs to get done. Folks, it isn't enough just to invest in our physical infrastructure, we also have to invest in our people, which we always did. We invested in our people.</p>, <p>That's why the second bill is the so-called Build Back Better plan. And here's what it does: It takes education—as I said, when America made 12 years of public education standard a century ago, it gave us the best-educated, best-prepared workforce in the world, and you saw what happened. Think of what would have happened after World War I and how America moved, because we were the best educated—overall—country in the world. And we led in the 20th century.</p>, <p>But as I said earlier, we know those 12 years is not enough any longer to compete in the 21st century. Study after study shows that earlier our children begin to learn, the better for themselves, their families, and for the Nation.</p>, <p>You know, you all know the statistics—and some of your teachers and your husband used to talk to me about this—and it was really basic: that if you come from a home where the mom or dad have books on the shelves and on the coffee table and read, and you come from a home where mom or dad can't read or has a sixth-grade education or has a little difficulty, the child coming from that middle class home is going to have heard a million more words spoken—not different words, spoken—spoken—than the child coming from a middle class home.</p>, <p>And that's because—look, what do you all do? You all know with your children or your grandchildren. You start talking to them when they're in the cradle. You engage them. They're the people who sit at the dinner table and still talk; they're engaged. So many homes, mothers or fathers, don't have the capacity or inclination to do that. But right now what are we doing? We're lagging behind.</p>, <p>Today, only about half of the 3- and 4-year-olds in America are enrolled in early education at all. Germany, France, the U.K., Latvia—their number is over 90 percent of the children.</p>, <p>It's not just early education. According to one study, we rank 12th among advanced economies when it comes to percentage of our young people who have attained any sort of post-high school degree. Ranked 12th in the world.</p>, <p>The Build Back Better plan gets us back on track. We'll make 2 years of high-quality preschool available to every child in America. Every child. And we're going to make investments education beyond high school. That includes increasing Pell grants, which nearly 200,000 students in Pennsylvania from low-income families rely on to attend college. We're going to increase it by $500. It's up to—so it becomes $1,900.</p>, <p>The bill invests in our workforce, providing much-needed breathing room for families.</p>, <p>My dad used to—I remember, when we moved to Wilmington, we finally were able to—after 4 years, Dad could buy a house. And we lived in a, quote, ""a development."" It was a lovely area and a suburban area. But it was a three-bedroom, split-level home. And we had four kids and my grandpop who lived with us or another relative all—for all those years we lived there.</p>, <p>And my bed was up—my headboard—well, not—didn't have a headboard. But my bed was up against the wall that was on—my dad and mom's bed was up against the wall. And I look back, and I—it was great for us having grandpops and relatives there. I don't know how my parents quite did it.</p>, <p>But I remember one night—I'm serious—it was in high school. And Dad—I could see—I could feel my dad was restless. He was moving. I could hear it in bed. And I asked the next morning—I asked my mom—it's a true story. I said, ""What's the matter with Dad, Mom?"" She said: ""He got bad news, honey. His company just said they're no longer going to pay for health insurance."" Well, guess what? My dad used to say: ""Everybody is entitled. All we're looking for is just a little breathing room."" Just a little bit of extra room—a little breathing room.</p>, <p>How can we compete in the world if millions of American parents, especially moms, who can't join the workforce because they can't afford the cost of childcare or eldercare, or they have to stay home?</p>, <p>I heard my colleagues speaking before I did. Here in Pennsylvania, the average annual cost of childcare for your toddler is $11,400. It's higher in other places. So an average two-parent family with two young kids spends 22 percent of their income for childcare every year.</p>, <p>I was a single dad for 5 years. I got elected to the Senate; I got a phone call before I got sworn in, when I was hiring staff, saying my wife and daughter had just been killed and my two boys were seriously injured. They were hospitalized for a long time.</p>, <p>So I—that's why I eventually started commuting. But I continued to commute because I could no more afford—and I was making a lot of money then. Now, granted, I was listed for 36 years as the poorest man in Congress, but—[<i>laughter</i>]—I was making $42,000 a year. And I didn't think my job was to make money when I was in Congress.</p>, <p>But this is not a joke. I could no more afford childcare than fly. But fortunately, I had a hell of a family, those values I talked about. My sister and her husband, after a little bit, they gave up their home. I came home one night, and they were moved into my home, helped me raise my kids.</p>, <p>Five years later—no man deserves one great love, let alone two. Five years later, when I met and married Jill, I came home after the wedding; they had moved out.</p>, <p>My brother Jimmy, my best friend, my mother—they all helped me take care of my kids. But I couldn't have done it. So I understand. How in God's name do people make it?</p>, <p>If you look at the world of advanced economics and—those advanced—those with advanced economies, their countries invest an average of—each of those countries invest an average of $14,000 per year in child—state-sponsored child/toddler care. America invests $500, 28 times less than our competitors.</p>, <p>Here's what it does to our economy—you all know it: Thirty years ago, we ranked seven in—seventh in the world among advanced economies in the share of women in the workforce. Today, in America, we rank 23d.</p>, <p>And women are becoming—not a joke—better educated than men. If you look at—and I do about five college commencements a year. Four of those five, the valedictorian out of those classes for the last 10 years has been a woman. And if you read the data now, we're worried about the number of men attending college.</p>, <p>Once again, our competitors are investing. We're standing still. My Build Back Better plan is designed to get us moving again.</p>, <p>Look, it's going to cut the cost of childcare for most Pennsylvania families in half. No middle-income family will pay more than 7 percent of their income on childcare under my proposal. Seven percent. It's going to help more people get back to work in a workforce and make ends meet.</p>, <p>It's also going to extend the historic middle class tax cut for parents. Everybody talks about—and by the way, I have a—I'm going to say something self-serving—but I got on pretty well in the Senate for all those years: a lot of Republican friends, as well as Democratic friends. For real. Kind of like Bobby. I mean, I—they're friends. We used to travel together a lot.</p>, <p>And here's the deal though: You know, what I was able to do when we passed the American Rescue Plan in the first month of my administration, which has allowed us to have all the funding for COVID. And when I started off, there were 2 million people in America that had gotten a vaccine. Well, guess what? We're up to 190 million. That's how we got it paid for.</p>, <p>But here's the deal: What it meant was—what it meant was—that, you know, right now there's a whole new attitude that's out there. How do we not invest? And so, in that act that we passed, we provided for a child tax credit, and you heard my introducer speak to it. Because we were in such dire straits, we were able to put into position a tax cut for middle class people. That's what it is. No one has a tax cut—we want to cut the capital gains tax for the wealthy or anybody—no one has a problem when we deal with that.</p>, <p>We have over 55 corporations in America—the Fortune 500—don't pay a single, solitary penny in taxes. Not 1 cent. Not 1 cent. They make $40 billion a year. But when you talk about a tax cut for middle class people—and that's exactly what it is.</p>, <p>By what we did, increasing—making a refundable tax cut—you know, the way it works now: If you've made enough money to have—owe more than $4,000 in taxes and you had two kids, you got to deduct it. And here's the deal: The fact of the matter is that if you didn't make that kind of money, you didn't get the benefit at all. It wasn't refundable; you didn't get the benefit at all of the tax cut. Because if you didn't have more than $4,000 in taxes, you didn't—you know, you still paid. And you—it wasn't refundable; you didn't get it back.</p>, <p>Well, here's the way we work it: We said, ""All right, for—temporarily, what we're going to do is make sure there's a childcare tax credit. And if you have one kid under seven, you get 3,600 bucks a year. And if you have one over 7 to 17, you get $3,000 a year."" We upped it from $2,000. Well, guess what? It's cut child poverty in Pennsylvania by 55 percent; in the Nation by 50 percent. It's a flat-out tax cut for ordinary people. That's what it does. I make no apologies for it.</p>, <p>But look, folks, there are so many things that we can do to change the way in which we work all of this. And I'm realizing I'm going on here, but the fact is there's so much at stake—so much at stake.</p>, <p>Look, the fact is that, most of all, what it does is—you know, we have a sandwich generation that exists, and many of you are part of that generation. You have a mom or dad who need some help when they get older, and you have a child that needs some help if you're going to be able to be in the workforce. And it's hard as hell—hard as hell—to make it work. You've got to give these folks a little bit of breathing room. The single greatest champion for eldercare in the United States of America is this guy right here, Bobby Casey. Not a joke. Not a joke.</p>, <p>The way it works right now: If you qualify for Medicaid—you have to have a lower income to qualify for Medicaid—not Medicare, Medicaid—there are 820,000 seniors, people with—or people with disabilities, who are on Medicaid, on a waiting list to get home care, which they're entitled to.</p>, <p>How many families are living this story? Your parents get older, they need some help getting around the house, making the meals for themselves; don't want to put them in nursing homes, only—not only because of the cost, but because of a matter of dignity.</p>, <p>They do better, they live longer if they can stay in their own home. But you also don't have the time or the money to take care of them at home, to do it. So you're just looking for an answer so your parents can keep living independently.</p>, <p>And if they hold here a second, one of the things that is important—think about this: In order to get into that nursing home, you've got to sell everything you have. You can't have any private property. You have to empty your bank account. You have to do it all to move into a nursing home.</p>, <p>I'm not saying nursing homes aren't valuable; they are. They're extremely valuable. But that's not where—I remember my uncle was—moved in with his wife into an assisted living center. And he wanted—and the folks who—who had built the facility—it was a lovely facility in Delaware—asked if I'd come and speak on the opening of it. And we're walking out, and I said, ""Mom, isn't this beautiful?"" She looked at me and said—and she was then 76 years old—she said: ""This is for old people, Joey. Not for me.""</p>, <p>I'm—but think about it: For millions of families, this is the most important issue they're facing. It's personal. It's personal. And Bob Casey gets it. When Bobby fights for something, he never gives up, in case you haven't noticed.</p>, <p>So here's what we're going to do: We're going to expand services for seniors so families can get help with well-trained, well-paid professionals to help them take care of their parents at home, to cook a meal for them, to get them their groceries when they need to get groceries, to help them get around, to just put in railings on their home.</p>, <p>When my mom lived with me—she moved in with me—we finally talked her into doing it. And guess what? My sister takes her up—you remember this? Jeanie remembers this—talking about this too. She takes her up to get her prescriptions, drives her back, gets out of the house. And she was—it was this little home off of our home. It was—she wouldn't move into—physically move into the house, even though we'd done the whole thing over for her. And she's just standing there and moves and breaks her hip. She didn't trip or anything. Broke her hip.</p>, <p>Well, guess what? Just having a railing, just having a place where she could walk from one room to the other and to help them in their own home with the dignity they deserve. Quite frankly, what we found is that this is more popular than anything else I'm proposing.</p>, <p>When you do this individual polling data, this is extremely popular, because we all feel that obligation to our parents. And we want them to live with dignity, look, because the American people understand the need. It's a matter of dignity. It's a matter of pride.</p>, <p>Look, that's what both these initiatives are all about. And frankly, they're about more than giving working families a break; they're about positioning our country to compete in the long haul. Economists left, right, and center agree.</p>, <p>Earlier this year, the Wall Street outfit, Moody's, projected that the investments I'm talking about will create for the next 20 years, on average, 2 million additional jobs per year, good-paying jobs. It's transformative. And we can make these transformation investments and be fiscally responsible.</p>, <p>Take the infrastructure bill. All those investments in roads, bridges, high-speed rail, internet—the whole deal—they represent less than one-half of 1 percent of our economic growth each year—less than one-half of 1 percent.</p>, <p>And the cost of the Build Back Better bill, in terms of adding to the deficit, is zero—is zero—zero, because we're going to pay for it all. In addition to that, half of it is a tax cut. It's not spending money; it's a tax cut for working class people.</p>, <p>And it's about time, as I said—and I come from the corporate State of the world. Not a joke. More corporations are in—registered in my State than every other State in the United States combined. And I represented the State of DuPont, as they used to call it, for 36 years. I'm not antibusiness, but I'm about, ""Just begin to pay your fair share.""</p>, <p>Look, folks, under this proposal—and under this proposal—these proposals I'm talking about—I guarantee you that no one making under $400,000 a year will see one single penny in tax go up. Not one. In fact, the plan cuts taxes for working people.</p>, <p>And by the way, if you notice the—you know, the way you usually pay for infrastructure bill—infrastructure is by gasoline taxes? I wouldn't allow that because that would tax people making under $400,000. I'm a man of my word. Not one single penny, when you pay—if you make more than—less than $400,000.</p>, <p>So—but there's no reason—there's no reason—why someone making 400 million [thousand]* a year—and by the way, you know, during this—all the crisis we've had with COVID, there's an absolute finite number of billionaires they can count up in the Tax Code. You know how much money the billionaires made last year, collectively? And they're not bad guys; I'm not saying that. They made $1 trillion—increased their collective income—$1 trillion. Just pay your fair share.</p>, <p>You know, if you are a multi-millionaire or a billionaire, you have a lower tax rate than a family who has a teacher and a firefighter as a percent of taxes you pay—lower. As I said, 55 of our largest corporations pay zero in income tax—40 billion bucks. This needs to change.</p>, <p>Working folks understand that. That's why that despite the attacks and misinformation about my plans, they're still overwhelming supported by the American people. They understand that when families have a little breathing room, America is in a better spot. And they know this is about dignity and respect, about building an economy from the bottom up and the middle, not from the top down.</p>, <p>As I said, name me a time in American history when the middle class has done well, but the wealthy haven't done very well. Name me a time.</p>, <p>So let me close with this: For too long, the working people of this Nation, the middle class in this country—the backbone of the country—have been dealt out. It's time to deal them back in.</p>, <p>I ran for President saying it was time to rebuild the backbone of the Nation. And by that, I was very precise: The middle class has been the backbone of this Nation. I couldn't have been any clearer. That's why I wrote both these bills in the first place and took them to the people. I campaigned on them, and the American people spoke.</p>, <p>I ran—they have no doubt about what I ran on. Both these bills were all what I talked about. But guess what? Eighty-one million people voted for me. More people voted than at any time in American history. And their voices deserve to be heard, not to be denied, or worse, be ignored.</p>, <p>Because here's what I know: If we make the investments, there's going to be no stopping America in the remainder of the 21st century.</p>, <p>I've long said—and I mean this to every world leader I've known—and I've now spoken to over 60 of them, and I've known them—many of them before that—I tell them it's never, ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America. No, never. Never, never. Which means it's always a good bet to bet on America.</p>, <p>And that's what these initiatives do: They bet on America. It's about believing in the American people. It's about believing—about believing. Just look at the history of the journey of this Nation. What becomes clear is this: Given half a chance—half a chance—the American people have never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever let the country down. Just a fighting chance; no guarantees. Just a chance. And that's what this is all about.</p>, <p>And it does not increase the debt. When you talk about the number—we shouldn't even talk about the numbers, because it's all paid for, written in the same piece of legislation. So, when you pass the spending, you're also passing the tax cuts, and you're passing the taxes that are going to be increased.</p>, <p>Scranton, thanks for always treating me so nicely. I really mean it.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.</p>]"

6,0,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Honoring the 2020 and 2021 National Teachers of the Year and State Teachers of the Year and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-honoring-the-2020-and-2021-national-teachers-the-year-and-state-teachers-the-year,"[<p><i>The President.</i> My name is Joe Biden; I'm Jill's husband. [<i>Laughter</i>] Please. Please, sit down. Please. Please, please, please.</p>, <p>Well, Mr. Secretary, as they say in parts of Claymont I am from, you've done good, fella. [<i>Laughter</i>] As you can see, I didn't get my English lessons from Jill. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Also here is a good friend of mine: chairman and the Congressman, Bobby Scott. Bobby, stand up.</p>, <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Hey, Bobby.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And, Randi, thank you, thank you, thank you. We kept our commitment, didn't we?</p>, <p><i>The First Lady. </i>Yes. That's what I said. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> All right. And I just want you to know, Becky, you know, Jill is a member of the union. I hope her dues are paid up. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>The First Lady.</i> They are.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> They are? Okay. I just want to check. I just want to check.</p>, <p>There's nowhere we'd would rather be than with educators. You know, when we decided to run and we got elected—Jill elected me—[<i>laughter</i>]—you all think I'm kidding, huh? [<i>Laughter</i>] Well, what happened was that we started thinking about it, and I knew immediately. Jill said, ""By the way""—and I said: ""It's okay with me. Teach full time."" She's the only—she's the only First Lady who's ever had a full-time job.</p>, <p>Now, the fact that I don't ever get to see her, the fact that she is either traveling on behalf of the people of this country or going to her classroom teaching 15 credits at the community college is a different story. But it is who she is. Like I heard her say—she probably said; I heard her say many times: Teaching is not what you all do, it's who you are. It's what you're made of.</p>, <p>And you know, one of the things that I—I used the line years ago—that I still think is relevant in a slightly different context: You know, when you think about it, the single most consequential people in the world, beyond our parents—God willing, if we have them—is our teachers. You are the ones who—you're the kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft. I mean it. Not a joke. It's a reality. It's a reality.</p>, <p>One of the reasons why we're working so hard—and the Secretary is helping so much—in the Build Back Better plan is that the rest of the world is starting to figure this out; the rest of the world is starting to outeducate us. Early education is earlier and more prevalent in European countries. A significant number—we rank number 34 out of 37 industrial nations in the world in the number of where we rank in terms of people getting a degree beyond high school.</p>, <p>And so we have to get back in step. And you're all the reasons. You're the best of the best. You know, for all of it—you know, by the way, where are my two Delaware teachers?</p>, <p><i>Audience member.</i> Here! [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Secretary of Education Miguel A. Cardona.</i> That's hilarious.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Who's New Castle? New Castle! All right. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>You can see we're not at all proud of Delaware. [<i>Laughter</i>] My dad used to always say: Never forget where you came from. As they say, them's the one that brung me to the dance. You know?</p>, <p>But I want to thank Rebecca, and I thank—of the Colonial Education Program in New Castle. And Kimberly of McKean High School in Wilmington.</p>, <p><i>2021 Delaware Teacher of the Year Kimberly Stock of Thomas McKean High School in Wilmington, DE.</i> That's me!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That's you. Okay! All right. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And now, to the two National Teachers of the Year: It's a pretty big deal. I listened to both of your speeches, and they're very impressive. And I mean it sincerely: What you do really matters. What you do really matters. And it matters in a way that I think you all don't fully realize. I don't think about—I'll bet—you know, I look at every important decision I made in my life. I ask myself three things—not a joke: what my dad and mom would think I should do.</p>, <p>But when we decided to—I'm just going to tell you a quick story. When I decided to help pick someone who was going to be the nominee for the Democratic Party—I was asked in Delaware to go out and try to find a candidate for the United States Senate—I was 28 years old, as part of this group of people. And I kept trying to get people to—who were consequential—to get involved, and they didn't want to do it. And Nixon was running that year. It was going to be a lead-pipe cinch; Republicans are going to win. And I was a Democrat.</p>, <p>And so I showed up at a Democratic convention—an off-year convention—and I went to make sure that everything was going to be okay. And I would report to—I was the kid at the convention. And it was in Dover, Delaware.</p>, <p>And, after the afternoon session, I went back to the hotel—a typical hotel—a motel where you drive up, you get out the car, and you walk in the door. And I was in there, I was shaving, and I had a towel around me, and I was in the bathroom—which is, like, 8 by 10—and two beds where the headboard is nailed to the wall—[<i>laughter</i>]—and a desk nailed to the wall.</p>, <p>And all of a sudden, I hear, ""Bam! Bam! Bam!"" There's banging on my door. And I thought it was a guy—a great friend named by Bob Cunningham and a guy named Dennis. I thought they were coming to pick me up, and I thought I was late.</p>, <p>So I went to the door with shaving cream and razor in my hand, towel on. I opened the door, and who's standing there, but the former Governor of the State of Delaware. [<i>Laughter</i>] Swear to God. A former chief justice of the State Supreme Court and Rhodes Scholar. And more members of his family were United States Senators than any family in American history. Thirdly, a Congressman who had been defeated earlier—a great guy, a five-term Congressman—and a guy named Henry Topel, who was the State chairman.</p>, <p>And they said, ""We're coming in."" I said—[<i>laughter</i>]—and I had not met two of them personally. Two I hadn't met. And I'm in my towel. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, I'm in a towel with shaving cream on my face.</p>, <p>And so I stepped back. I said: ""Oh, gentlemen. Okay. Please come in."" And I went into the bathroom thinking I'm going to get—put something on. I get in, and I realized there's nothing to put on. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>So I wiped the shaving cream off my face, and I walk out, and I was mortified. And I said, ""I'm sorry, gentlemen."" They said, ""It's okay."" And there were two of them—each on the end of each of the two beds that were facing me. And I'm against the desk like this.</p>, <p>And this guy, Henry Topel, said that—he was from New York. He said: ""Joe, we just had dinner. We were thinking, and you should run for the United States Senate."" And I said, ""Oh, geez."" I said, ""Mr. Chairman""—I said, ""I'm not old enough."" And the then-chief justice—retired chief justice—of course, said, ""Joe, obviously, you didn't do very well in law school."" [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>I looked at him. He said: ""It says you have to be 30 years old to be sworn in, not to be elected. You can be—and you'll turn 30 by the time it's time to be sworn in."" And anyway, that was my exposure—no pun intended—[<i>laughter</i>].</p>, <p>And so I go to the event, and I'm riding home with this guy, Bob Cunningham, who was a really bright guy, and I said: ""Bob, I don't know what in God's name I'm going to do. This is crazy."" And so I'm thinking, ""Who am I going to talk to?"" True story.</p>, <p>And the next morning, I get up and I called my professor at the University of Delaware, a guy named Dr. Ingersoll. And I said, ""Doctor, can I come down and see you?"" And he said, ""Of course."" I went down and sat with him for a half an hour. I told him what was happening. He just looked at me, and he said, ""Joe, remember what Plato said."" And I'm thinking, ""What the hell did Plato say?"" [<i>Laughter</i>] But he said, ""To paraphrase Plato, he said the penalty good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse than themselves.""</p>, <p>And he looked at me, and he said, ""Joe, you should run."" I said, ""But I feel strongly about all of these issues, but I""—I had gotten involved in the civil rights movement and the war—but I—he said, ""Joe, you should do it."" He had enough confidence in me that he gave me confidence in myself. With a kid with no money, coming from a middle class family, who grew up in grade school stuttering, literally, for me, I'm confident I would have never done it were it not for Dr. Ingersoll.</p>, <p>I'm sure there are people—each of you—you can look back at, and they've changed your life. But most of all, what you do is, you give us confidence. You instill confidence. Just like when I was a kid when I used to stutter badly, the nuns would sit me down and they'd say, ""Joey, you can do this,"" and practiced with me. They gave me confidence.</p>, <p>And so, folks, you know, as Jill always says, ""Teaching is not who you—what you do, it's who you are.""</p>, <p>And it also is—I—let me conclude by saying this about something that—as a strong proponent of education, I became friends—and Jill as well—but I became friends with Colin Powell, who we just lost.</p>, <p>Think of where Colin Powell—he's not only a dear friend and a patriot, one of our great military leaders, and a man of overwhelming decency, but this is the guy born the son of immigrants in New York City, raised in Harlem, in the South Bronx, graduated from City College of New York. And he rose to the highest ranks not only in the military, but also in areas of foreign policy and statecraft.</p>, <p>This is a guy—and we talk about it—who had teachers who looked at this African American kid and said, ""You can do anything.""</p>, <p>So all I want to say to you, really, is: Don't underestimate. Don't underestimate what you do. The good news about you all is, you underestimate it so you come off in a way that you don't feel self-important. But you're gigantic. You make a gigantic difference.</p>, <p>And I learned that when Jill and I would walk through the malls on Christmas time when I was a Senator, and kids would go, ""Hey, hey, hey!"" And I'd wave. [<i>Laughter</i>] And they'd say: ""No, no, no, no. Dr. Biden! Dr.""—[<i>laughter</i>]. Swear to God.</p>, <p>So, folks, thank you for what you do. I really mean it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>, <p>And now I've got a few little gifts to give here.</p>, <p><i>The First Lady.</i> This is for Tabitha.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Tabatha, can you come up here? I don't want to drop this. Do you want to hand it to her?</p>, <p><i>The First Lady.</i> No, you hand it to her.</p>, <p><i>2020 National Teacher of the Year Tabatha Rosproy of Winfield Early Learning Center.</i> Me neither.

But I want you to have this and to tell you—let you know how much we appreciate you and all you do.</p>, <p><i>Ms. Rosproy.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Ms. Rosproy.</i> Thank you so much.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm not sure if—[<i>inaudible</i>].</p>, <p><i>Ms. Rosproy.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] I'll be really careful.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Okay, good. All right.</p>, <p><i>The First Lady.</i> And this is Juliana's.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Juliana, come on up here. Juliana, I had a great friend who was a former Senator from Texas who looked at me one day—he's passed away now—and he said, ""Joe, you'll never get elected President unless you can learn to speak Spanish.""</p>, <p><i>2021 National Teacher of the Year Juliana Urtubey of Kermit R.

6,1,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks at the National Peace Officers Memorial Service,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-peace-officers-memorial-service-10,"[<p>Thank you, Sergeant. My name is Joe Biden. I am Jill Biden's husband. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's how I'm better known.</p>, <p>President Yoes, Auxiliary President Hennie, Auxiliary President Layman and—excuse me, Lehmann—and a guy I've known for a long, long time, Jimmy Pasco, executive director: Thank you for this invitation to be with you today.</p>, <p>The Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas, thank you for being here and for the great job you're doing for us. Thank you very, very much. And it's a tough job.</p>, <p>Most importantly, to the families here today, this is all about you—about you. You know, I've been coming to this memorial for 40 years. I missed a couple, but—and I've spoken at many—too many police memorials all around the country. And it always amazes me how the public doesn't fully understand what we expect of our law enforcement officers.</p>, <p>We expect you to be people ready to stand in the way and take a bullet for us. We expect you to be able to track down the bad guys. We expect you to be the psychologist who talks the couple that are having a violent confrontation together to step back. We expect you to be everything. We expect everything of you. And it's beyond the capacity of anyone to meet the total expectations. Being a cop today is one hell of a lot harder than it's ever been.</p>, <p>And to the families of the fallen: You've suffered an enormous loss. But understand, your loss is also America's loss. America's loss. And your pain is America's pain. We're waking up to the notion that unless we change the environment in which the job can be done, we're going to have trouble having enough women and men come forward to want to do the job.</p>, <p>I hope all the families—sons, daughters, husbands, wives, moms, dads—I hope you're able to take a measure of comfort and strength from the extended family you have here and all around you. In remembrance and respect of this memorial and this day, I ordered our flags to be flown at halfstaff.</p>, <p>We've met here, in front of this United States Capitol, many times before to memorialize our fallen heroes. And it's particularly appropriate today, because here, 9 months ago, your brothers and sisters thwarted an unconstitutional and fundamentally un-American attack on our Nation's values and our votes. But because of you, democracy survived—but only because of the women and men of the U.S. Capitol Police force, the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police Department, and other law enforcement agencies who once again, literally, put their bodies on the line to protect our democracy.</p>, <p>That's why I have no hesitation—had none at all—in signing the law awarding the Congressional Gold Medal of Congress—the highest expression of our Nation's appreciation—to the U.S. Capitol Police and Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police and other responding law enforcement agencies. Because of these men and women, we averted a catastrophe. But their heroism came at a cost to you and your families: 150 officers injured; 5 lost in the attack's aftermath.</p>, <p>The toll on this profession these past years has been heavy—too heavy; 2020 was the deadliest year for law enforcement on record. And today we're here to remember nearly 500 of your brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, sons and daughters—2019 and 2020, we lost so much.</p>, <p>I've attended this memorial many times, as I said, to pay my respects. Sometimes, I've been the speaker; other times, I've sat on this stage and just thought about all of you sitting on the lawn. Although this year, I don't know any that personally—who have fallen, any of the individuals; I've gone through all the names—I feel I know them with—not—without having ever met them.</p>, <p>You see, I grew up in a neighborhood—a neighborhood in Scranton, Pennsylvania; and Claymont, Delaware; and Bellefonte, where I grew up with the guys and women that we're honoring today. One of my best friends in grade school, Eddie Hill, became a superintendent of the Delaware State Police, a great friend and competitor in the other major high school. We played ball against one another. Charlie Dougherty became the head of the—chief of the Wilmington Police force. And so many more. So, although I didn't know them personally, I know you. I know you.</p>, <p>I always joke that I grew up in places where you either became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest. I wasn't qualified for them, so I had to settle for this. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But all kidding aside, over the years, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I've gotten to know you. Even as kids, we could see, in the women and men around us, who are the ones who had the heart. They're the ones who ran in to help you when everyone else was running away. They ran toward cries for help, even when they were in grade school, knowing that they'd be able to help a little bit, even if they were outnumbered.</p>, <p>And I'm not making this up. Think about it. Think about your son, your daughter, your husband, your wife, who they were, what was inside them. It was about service, to protect, defend. This isn't just what law enforcement does, it's who you are. It's what makes you who you are. And when you put on that shield in the morning and walk out the door each day, every family member dreads the possibility of receiving that phone call.</p>, <p>I was talking to Steny about this. Just as our son Beau was in Kosovo for about 6 months and in Iraq for a year, he was the chief law enforcement officer for the State of Delaware, the attorney general. And I'd watch every morning—because she left for school before I got on the train—Jill standing there mouthing a prayer while she drank a cup of coffee over the sink, praying—praying for Beau. Well, you do it every day. You did it every day.</p>, <p>You know, there's a line from an English poet, John Milton. He said, ""They also serve who only stand and wait."" How long have you had to stand and wait and wonder when you heard something on the news or saw it on television? Thousands and thousands of American families stand and wait so their husbands, their wives, their fathers, their mothers, sons and daughters, can serve the rest of us.</p>, <p>We not only owe them, we owe you. This is not hyperbole. I mean this from the bottom of my heart: We owe you, willing to support them. And too many of you sitting out there have received that terrible call that your loved one won't be coming home at the end of his or her shift.</p>, <p>To the mothers and fathers that are here today: My heart aches for you. Believe it or not, Jill and I understand. We got one of those calls in a different circumstance.</p>, <p>No parent should have to bury a child. I lost a baby daughter in an accident. I lost a brave son to cancer after coming home from a year in Iraq. But you know what? What you've gone through is hard. The fact that he was a chief law enforcement officer of Delaware, he wasn't out there literally. He'd go on patrols, but he wasn't out there walking up those stairs to make that arrest or try to stop that fight. He was—it was always about family.</p>, <p>It's like losing a piece of your soul. Some of you still have that feeling like you've been sucked into a black hole in your chest, wondering, ""My God, will it ever change?""</p>, <p>Sergeant McClain from Detroit, decorated for exemplary service during his 16-year career. He turned down promotions so he could continue to work as a mentor to other officers in his district. Every 2 weeks, he'd send his wife flowers at work, like clockwork, to brighten her day and her office. He was killed responding to a domestic violence call.</p>, <p>Officer Tiffany-Victoria Enriquez from Honolulu. She was one of two officers killed while responding to a call and was the first female officer to die in the line of duty in the Honolulu Police Department. Her boyfriend, also an officer, called her, quote, ""the most hard-working, amazing, fiercest officer I've ever known. My heart is shattered, and she was my love, my rock, my strength.""</p>, <p>So many. Officer Charles Braz—excuse me, Brazydlo—excuse me, Barzyldo—passed away in 2016, but he was recognized in his line of duty this year. He was part of an elite unit of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a unit trained to perform technical rescue operations.</p>, <p>After the terrorists attacked on September 11, he was assigned to search and recover—recovery efforts at the World Trade tower. He, like so many others, contracted cancer. He died of cancer following that assignment.</p>, <p>He made friends wherever he went. He loved the outdoors. He was his neighborhood go-to guy, organizing almost anything, including hunting expeditions.</p>, <p>As you call the roll today, we're acutely aware that behind each name are families. As I said, we know from personal experience that every time there's a ceremony or memorial honoring your lost husband or wife, son or daughter, it can summon that pride, but also that terrible feeling, as if you're just hearing the news for the first time.</p>, <p>So I want you to know: I know, although you looked forward to honoring your family member, it's hard. It's hard. I mean this sincerely: Jill and I admire your courage for just being here. And we hope you take some comfort in the knowledge that the men and women here assembled today, they'll always be with you. Not a joke. They'll always be with you, wherever you are—and even if you don't know them—in a city, a town, a place you've never been before.</p>, <p>And as much as we hope not, there are going to be more names added to this roll call of bravery and sorrow. There already have been. As I was preparing these remarks early this morning, in Houston, the deputy killed—one deputy killed and two wounded.</p>, <p>Chief Finner from Houston is here today. I don't know where the chief is, but he's here today, I'm told. I've known him—seven Houston Police officers in his department were killed in the line of duty since 2019. Chief, I'm here for you, pal, and so is everybody else. We mourn the fallen. We pray for the recovery of the wounded.</p>, <p>As I've said, I've spoken many—too many times, too many funerals for police officers; too many funerals for brave servants who kept us safe. So, under the mournful sound of the bagpipes, we must also hear something else: a call to do better, to do more, to keep you safe, to keep our communities safer; for us to step up, to build trust and respect and heal the breach we now see in so many communities; to recognize that the promise of equal and impartial justice remains a promise but not always a reality for you or others, particularly in low-income communities, too many communities, Black and Brown. Too many families are grieving unnecessary losses of their sons, their daughters, their fathers, their brothers.</p>, <p>I want to acknowledge the FOP, as was mentioned earlier, for sincerely trying to reach an agreement on meaningful reforms, congressional reform, in the negotiations over the George Floyd [Justice]* in Policing Act. But here's the part: A lot of the help has to come to police departments. They need help to do better.</p>, <p>I want to thank you for being the constructive player in this process. We haven't gotten there yet, but we must get there. Look, there's too much pain. There's too much loss. There's too much at stake for the safety and for the safety of those you serve.</p>, <p>It's a hard time to be a police officer in America. So I want to make sure you have the tools to be the partners and the protectors your communities need; that when you look at what your communities need and what you're being asked to do, there isn't going to be—there are going to be more resources, not fewer resources, to help you do your job.</p>, <p>That's why I proposed we invest in—we invest again in community policing we know works—one thing that protects cops is another cop; in the training you and the community have requested, the community-based programs and interventions that can stop violence before it starts; provide specific guidance explaining that communities can and should use funds from the American Rescue Plan, $350 billion in aid to cities, States, counties, Tribes, to hire and retain officers. Many cities, from Albuquerque to Saint Paul, are doing just that.</p>, <p>And I proposed an additional $300 million in my budget to support community policing across the country. It's hard when you don't know the community. And the most important way to get to know them—it has more police. We're also investing in community violence intervention programs, which are proven—have a proven track record of reducing violence by up to 60 percent in cities across the Nation.</p>, <p>At the same time, we have to stop asking law enforcement officers to do every single job under the Sun. I'm committed to investing in mental health services and mental health professionals who can respond to a mental health crisis alongside you. You shouldn't be the one having to talk someone off the edge of the roof. You should have professional help with you.</p>, <p>Support our law enforcement officers—requires that we invest in the systems that provide adequate health care, counseling, drug treatment and prevention, housing, education, and other social services in the community so there is not the discord.</p>, <p>We need to work together to confront the epidemic of gun violence. Your brothers and sisters have told me over the years, sometimes, you feel like you're ""outgunned."" Right now the Justice Department, under the leadership of Attorney General Garland, is working with State and local law enforcement across the country to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals.</p>, <p>They now have zero tolerance for gun dealers who willfully violate the law, putting firearms into the hands of people who are a danger to the community and you. I also want to make it easier for States to adopt red-flag laws: laws that allow family members or law enforcement to petition a court order to temporarily remove firearms from people who are in crisis, representing a danger to themselves and to others. By the way, more people die of gunshot wounds in America as a consequence of suicide than any other reason.</p>, <p>I've called on Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and to close the domestic violence loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. Forty percent of all calls that result in an officer's death were domestic violence related. Forty percent.</p>, <p>These steps will protect you, protect the people you serve.</p>, <p>And finally, and tragically, in the past 2 years, COVID-19 has caused more deaths in the line of duty than all of the other causes combined. Many of those lost their lives keeping our society safe, serving on the front lines in those dark, early days of the pandemic.</p>, <p>But now, let us prevent the preventable tragedies. The last time I stood here was to take the oath of office as your President. I said that day, we have ""much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build, much to gain."" It remains true. I believe with all my heart there's nothing you're unable to do if we equip you; that we can unite this Nation and fight our common foes: anger, resentment, hatred, extremism, racism, lawlessness, violence, disease, joblessness, hopelessness.</p>, <p>We have never, ever failed in America when we've acted together. So let's act together to support you in the service of the Nation we love.</p>, <p>In closing, let me say that I know there are no words, no memorials that can fill that void, that black hole in your chest so many of you feel. But I promise you, the day will come when the memory of your loved one will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye. That's when you know you're going to make it. That's when you know. That will happen. But my prayer for you is that that day will come sooner than later.</p>, <p>There is a headstone in a cemetery in Ireland that reads: ""Death leaves a heartache no one can heal. Love leaves a memory that no one can steal."" They're with you. They're in your heart. They're part of you.</p>, <p>May the souls of those you love and those with whom you served rest in peace and rise in glory. In the meantime, you're in our prayers. May God bless you, and may God protect all those who serve us in uniform. Thank you.</p>]"

And that's what we're working on.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>But what's your message to the union workers who are on strike across the country right now?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm sorry?</p>, <p><i>Labor Issues </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>What's your message to the union workers striking across the country right now?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> My message is that they have a right to strike and they have a right to demand higher wages. And the companies they're striking on are doing very well. I'm not going to get into the negotiation, but my message is: If you think that's what you need, then you should do it.</p>, <p><i>Infrastructure, Jobs, Education, and Family Assistance Legislation </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, you expressed some uncertainty about the 2 years of free community college in your reconciliation package during your speech at the childcare center. Would you sign a package that doesn't include that proposal?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Look—[<i>laughter</i>]—obviously—are you married?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>I'm not.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Okay. Well, you're going to have to learn how to negotiate better.</p>, <p>All kidding aside, look, it's clear that it's not going to be $3.5 trillion. So, the question is: How much of what is important do we get into the legislation? I'm of the view that it's important to establish the principle on a whole range of issues without guaranteeing you get the whole 10 years. It doesn't—it matters to establish it.</p>, <p>I don't know of any major change in American public policy that's occurred by a single piece of legislation. There probably is; I just can't think of one.</p>, <p>And so what happens is, you pass the principle and you build on it if in fact it either works or it doesn't work. And I'm convinced that's why I think you see so much support, even from the folks who are holding out, for the child tax credit.</p>, <p>Well, the child—but they didn't have that idea when I convinced them to pass it the first time when we did the act in January—I mean, yes, February. But now people are seeing it. It's practical, it works, and it's fair.</p>, <p>And so, you know, I doubt whether we'll get the entire funding for community colleges, but I'm not going to give up on community colleges as long as I'm President.</p>, <p><i>Child Tax Credit Extension </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>What about just the child tax credit and all that childcare money that you talked about today? Do you have any sense of whether Senators Manchin and Sinema support putting that in the reconciliation package?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. Yes.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Yes, they do? They both do?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, I have a sense.</p>, <p><i>Former President William J. Clinton </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>What did you say to President Clinton today? How did you guys——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, I wanted to see how he was doing. And—because I've been trying to get a hold of him. He's doing fine; he really is. And he's going to be released from the hospital. And we talked about—which we were going to do before—getting together—I haven't seen him in a while—and for him to come over and have some lunch and talk.</p>, <p>He was very encouraging about why he thought the policies I was pursuing made sense, but we didn't get into much detail, except—it was mainly just to see how he's doing.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Is he staying in the hospital, or is he getting out?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I think he's not in any serious condition. He is getting out shortly, as I understand it. Whether that's tomorrow or the next day, I don't know.</p>, <p><i>Virginia Gubernatorial Race </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Did you guys talk about McAuliffe's race, Terry McAuliffe's race in Virginia?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, we didn't talk about any—that I can think of—I don't think we talked about any particular race. I'm going to go in for the Governor.</p>, <p><i>Virginia and New Jersey Gubernatorial Races </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Do you think McAuliffe—do you think Terry McAuliffe's race is a foreshadowing for what the Democrats—how the Democrats will fare in the midterm? Is that how you see it?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, look, I think everybody understandably reads the two gubernatorial off-year elections as being a bellwether of what may happen. Sometimes, it's been right; sometimes, it's been wrong. I think Terry is going to win. If he doesn't win, I don't know how much you read into that, but you know, I—but, I think he'll win.</p>, <p><i>Federal Reserve System </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Have you met recently with Lael Brainard or Chair Powell about the Fed Chair search?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> It's been nice talking to you. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Senator Dodd has been a big supporter of Chairman Powell. I mean, did you talk to him about that today? Where are you?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I didn't.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> No?</p>, <p><i>Infrastructure, Jobs, Education, and Family Assistance Legislation </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Earlier, you said that, in regard to not getting the full $3.5 trillion, later you would go back for the rest.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Sure.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>What exactly did you mean by that?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Figure it out. If you can't figure it out, you shouldn't be a reporter.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>]"
6,4,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks at the Dedication of the Dodd Center for Human Rights at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-dedication-the-dodd-center-for-human-rights-the-university-connecticut-storrs,"[<p>Thank you so very much. My name is Joe Biden. I am Jill Biden's husband. I'm delighted to be here. Thank you. Thank you.</p>, <p>It is truly—it's not hyperbole to suggest—it's a great honor to be here, a genuine honor, and—at this great public university celebrating the life and legacy of not one, but two proud sons of Connecticut: Senator Thomas Dodd and my good friend—and we truly are really good, close friends—Senator Chris Dodd.</p>, <p>Chris and I have known each other for a long time. But if you'll excuse a point of personal privilege, as we used to say in the Senate, I saw up close how he fought for human rights and human dignity in the Senate.</p>, <p>Do you know my measure? Madam Ambassador, Ambassador Kennedy, do you know what my measure is? People who tell me they care about people and then disrespect the waitress or a waiter. People who tell me they care about how, in fact, people are entitled to be treated with dignity and walk by someone at a shoeshine stand and doesn't say ""hello."" People who do not do the just simply decent things for ordinary people. That's the real measure.</p>, <p>I've never seen Chris, figuratively or—speaking, walk by anybody. I've never seen him ignore his wife, ignore his two brilliant, beautiful daughters.</p>, <p>I remember the passion and eloquence that you brought to the floor, Chris, whether you were fighting for American families or serving as the Senate leader—leading voice on engagement with Latin America and the Caribbean. And your brother, the Ambassador, did a pretty damn good job as well.</p>, <p>I think that the work this Senator is doing to bring human rights to the forefront of public understanding is making a real and immediate impact for all young people today. I know—I think it's going to rate high among your family's many great and lasting contributions to the country, Chris. And I know this is truly a family commitment for the Dodds, so thank you for inviting me to be part of this. I think it's a—I really mean it: It's an honor to be able to be here.</p>, <p>Of course, I owe Chris. I remember when—as he pointed out, when were both running for President back in 2007 with almost no cash in either of our campaigns—[<i>laughter</i>]—you let me hop a ride with you in a twin-engine prop plane—[<i>laughter</i>]—true story—from our Senate vote in DC to a Democratic debate in New Hampshire.</p>, <p>And we were on our way to the debate one other time, but the whole way up, we just laughed and told stories before we were debating one another. And then the next day, to get back to the Senate to vote, we had to flag down a young—remember this?—flag down a young Senator named Barack Obama—[<i>laughter</i>]—to get to even open the airport. [<i>Laughter</i>] God's truth. Remember that, Chris? [<i>Laughter</i>] Here, he'd just been there 2 years. He was on my Foreign Relations Committee—I was chairman. I said, ""Can you get the airport open for us?"" [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>I used to—I'd kid Barack. I couldn't understand why he so soundly defeated me in that primary. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then I realized when he'd be introduced, he'd be introduced by the ""Voice of God."" I'd get introduced by ""Johnny Scanafrana."" [<i>Laughter</i>] So it took a while for me to figure all this out. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Luckily, Chris, I got to travel on a much nicer plane these days. [<i>Laughter</i>] And it's yours to travel on any time you would like.</p>, <p>I want to thank a few more proud Connecticut leaders who have been spending time with me today: Governor Lamont, you have been—you're one of the finest Governors in the country. I'm not being solicitous; that's a fact. Exceeded only by your wife. [<i>Laughter</i>] And Senator Blumenthal—who I mentioned earlier today—I apologize for repeating this, but my son Beau Biden is the one who should be standing here talking to you. My son Beau Biden was the attorney general of the State of Delaware. And one of the people he went to and sought advice from, for real, was then-Attorney General Blumenthal. They became friends. And my son was a great admirer. And I think the Senator knows that.</p>, <p>And Senator Murphy—if I have to have someone in the foxhole with me, I want Murph with me, man. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, I'm serious. This guy knows as much about foreign policy as anybody does, and his failure to remain silent has meant a great deal to me, because he's spoken up on so much.</p>, <p>And, Representative Courtney, I thank you. Thank you for your help and your support. And Rosa DeLauro. Rosa—I don't owe as much as Chris does to Rosa, but I owe a hell of a lot to her. My son was married, and it was his second year of law school, and he transferred to Yale Law School. And Rosa heard that I was coming up with him.</p>, <p>And the apartment he rented was less than ideal—[<i>laughter</i>]—and the whole thing had to be painted. My brother Jimmy fixes everything—my brother Jimmy was with us, and we went down and bought about 28 gallons of paint. I don't know how—but, for real, it was hot as hell as well.</p>, <p>And I'm up on a—on an 8-foot ladder, painting the crown molding and sweating like the proverbial you-know-what. And I hear——</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President knocked on the podium.</i>]</p>, <p>——at the door. I said, ""Come in."" And the then-alderman—is it alderman or councilman at the time? Alderman. Alderman DeLauro walked in—her mom.</p>, <p>And she said, ""Where's Biden?"" [<i>Laughter</i>] And I said, ""I'm here."" She said: ""No, stop fooling with me, son. Where's Biden?"" I said: ""No, no, I'm Biden. I'm Biden."" And she came—she says, ""I just wanted to come over and introduce myself and tell your son I'll be taking care of him."" And in walks the chief of police. [<i>Laughter</i>] I thought, ""Holy God, what did I do?"" [<i>Laughter</i>] She says: ""You're going to have nothing to worry about. You have nothing to worry about."" Talk about constituent service—Rosa, you come by it honestly.</p>, <p>And, Rosa, we've all—and I'm not being solicitous—again, I'm using that word twice now—we've all learned a great deal from you. I want to thank you for your longstanding dedication to the—relating to the well-being of children and families, and for championing and expanding the child tax credit, which is a gigantic middle class tax cut for working families that finally got passed in the American Rescue Plan, which we were able to get done immediately upon being elected.</p>, <p>And Rosa will not tell you, but she's the first person I called to ask for her help as to how I should do this. And that put money in the pockets of families all across this country, even as we speak. It's how we're going to cut child poverty in this country. And we've already cut it in—nearly in half. And none of us should lose sight of what it meant to American families when we think about our mission to defend human rights and dignity at home and around the world.</p>, <p>Twenty-six years ago today, another United States Senator—a United States President—who I just spoke to, Chris, literally an hour and a half ago—Bill Clinton—and he sends his best, by the way—visited this university to dedicate the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center—a library and archives of papers that amount to an incredible first-person first draft of history.</p>, <p>And let me say that we're all thinking about President Clinton today and sending him his good wishes to a speedy recovery. And he's always been the ""Comeback Kid."" He's getting out of the hospital. Everything is going well. But he wanted to send his best.</p>, <p>As a young lawyer, Tom Dodd had already built a record of fighting hatred by prosecuting the KKK in the South, but—when, in 1945, he left behind his beloved Grace and his five young children—a young Christopher just 14 months old at the time—to travel to the bombed-out cities of Europe to document the shocking atrocities, still fresh in their horror; to question and cross-examine some of history's most notorious villains—and that's not hyperbole; some of history's most notorious villains—and to expose beyond question the depravity and the crimes against humanity that the Nazi regime committed.</p>, <p>Tom Dodd dedicated his intellect and his moral passion and his resolute sense of right and wrong to making the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal a testament to justice. And that's what it was: a testament to justice. Nothing like it ever happened before.</p>, <p>And all the while, he was writing letters to his Grace, lamenting their separation but recognizing the momentous weight of history that rested on his shoulders. And, Chris, I came up—the same sentence from your book: ""Someday,"" he wrote, ""will be recognized as a great landmark in the struggle of mankind for peace. . . . Never before has such a record been written and men will read it for a thousand years in amazement and wonder . . . how it [ever] happened.""</p>, <p>When President Clinton spoke at this first dedication, he ended on a pointed reminder. He said, and I quote, ""The road to tyranny, we must never forget, begins with the destruction of . . . truth."" The road to tyranny begins with the destruction of truth.</p>, <p>In my view, that was the lesson at the heart of the Nuremberg trials: finding truth, documenting it so it could never be denied. In court, Tom Dodd built the case fact-by-fact, using the Nazis' own meticulous records of crimes and shocking human evidence to pin down Nazi leaders who tried to deny their complicity and feign ignorance.</p>, <p>And even more important, it denied the entire German policy [population]* the ability to feign ignorance. To deal with the past, you must face the truth, whether it was Dachau or Buchenwald, Auschwitz, or other camps. Millions of Jews rounded up, along with members of other minority groups, and thrown into camps, abused, used as forced labor, medical experimentation. Six million Jews murdered, including so many who met their ultimate fate in the gas chamber.</p>, <p>He made sure no one could deny their own eyes and what they saw. He preserved the truth, ugly and as traumatic as it was, for all of history so that the horrors of the Holocaust could never be diminished or denied. An evil that we still have to guard against to this day has to be watched.</p>, <p>Chris, as you heard me say many times before—because you got to meet my dad—my dad was a well-read, high school-educated fellow whose greatest regret was he never went to college. But he cared deeply about human dignity.</p>, <p>Our dinner table—my dad was what many would call a ""righteous Christian."" He happened to be a Catholic, but he was a righteous Christian. And growing up, my dad would come home for dinner before he went back to close the business he managed. And the dinner table was a place where we sat down to have conversation and, incidentally, eat. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm serious.</p>, <p>My dad used to talk about, as a student of the Holocaust, what a tragedy it was we didn't bomb the railroad tracks toward the end of the war; how wrong it was that we turned away the <i>St. Louis,</i> a ship full of Jewish refugees from Europe.</p>, <p>He believed passionately the only way we could make real the promise of ""never again"" was to keep reminding ourselves of what had happened and how so many people—otherwise thought themselves decent people—rationalized that it really wasn't happening—""we didn't know what was going on""—because they weren't turning on the gas valve, they had no responsibility.</p>, <p>That's why, if you'll again excuse a point of personal privilege, when each of my children—and now my grandchildren—turned the age of 15, the first thing I've done—my word as a Biden—is put them on an aircraft and fly to Dachau, one at a time, at age 15. ""Work sets you free""—as you go through the entrance.</p>, <p>But that's not what I wanted them to see. I wanted them to see the lovely homes that were right up against the fence line with their beautiful roofs. People living in there rationalized that: ""It's not me. I'm not doing this. And I don't know, really, what's going on in there."" I wanted them to see the ability of the human mind to rationalize cannot be underestimated.</p>, <p>I would say, parenthetically, the reason why Germany has been able to turn it around, unlike other countries, is because they faced it head on, acknowledged. So let me say it again: Nuremberg was unlike anything that ever came before. It was not about vengeance. It was about accountability. For only acknowledging the truth can we prevent the repetition of atrocities, which are happening now in other parts of the world.</p>, <p>It elevated our conception, as Chris said, of the rule of law. It set a marker for the future of justice, uplifted the importance of human rights in international affairs. We see it in the Nuremberg tribunals—the blueprint we see in those tribunals—the blueprint for future United Nations tribunals that would help deliver justice after atrocities committed in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.</p>, <p>We see it in the values championed at Nuremberg and the antecedents of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the foundation of a rules-based international order built out of the wreckage of two wars—world wars—not just to prevent us from destroying ourselves, but to actively build a better future.</p>, <p>We see it in the passion of a young prosecutor, the commitment to prioritizing the human impacts of policies, the commitment carried through in his son's career of public service and by all the students of this institute who've been inspired by the example. We need you. We need you badly. And as we look around the world today, we see human rights and democratic principles increasingly under assault. We feel the same charge of history upon our own shoulders to act.</p>, <p>We have fewer democracies in the world today than we did 15 years ago. Fewer. Not more—fewer. Cannot be sustained. That's why, from day one of my administration, I've taken concrete steps to put human rights back at the center of our foreign policy and reassert our moral leadership on the global stage; to lead, as Chris has so often heard me say, with the power of our example, not the example of our power.</p>, <p>When Chris and I served on the Foreign Relations Committee, we excoriated the abuses elsewhere in the world and called for action overseas. But human rights, in some ways, stood apart from the domestic struggle of civil rights and civil liberties and equal justice here at home. Today, we know that our efforts to defend human rights around the world are stronger because we recognize our own historic challenges as part of that same fight.</p>, <p>Leading by example means taking action at home to renew and defend our own democracy; to advance equity and promote justice; to defend the sacred right to vote in free, fair, and secure elections. Leading by example means not pretending that our history has been perfect, but demonstrating how strong nations speak honestly about the past and uphold the truth and strive to improve.</p>, <p>We make the best case for gender equality, racial justice and equity, religious freedom, the rights of the LGBTQ+ peoples and other marginalized communities around the world by practicing what we preach. The first 10 minutes I was in office I ended the Muslim ban; advancing racial equity throughout the Federal Government; overturning the ban on transgender individuals serving openly in the United States military; establishing the White House Gender Policy Council.</p>, <p>Demonstrating that our commitment to human rights begins at home is among the most powerful and persuasive tools in our foreign policy kit. And as we defend human rights beyond our shores, we're more effective when we work together, allies and partners in our shared values.</p>, <p>America, as a nation, is unique in all history, not because we're inherently better, because the basis upon which we're organized. Virtually every other nation is organized based on ethnicity, religion, geography, color. We're unique in all the world. We're based on one guiding principle: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>, <p>We have never lived up to it. We've never, until very recently, walked away from it. The arc has always bent closer and closer to justice and inclusion. The moment we stop, the moment we rest is the moment that our influence diminishes. So we're reengaging multilaterally and rallying the world to advance universal human rights and fundamental freedoms to prove that democracies can still deliver in an age of fast-moving, cross-cutting challenges.</p>, <p>We have rejoined the U.N. Human Rights Council, which we walked away from—the United States of America, last time, didn't want to be part. I mean, just yesterday we won an election to a new 3-year term that begins in January on that committee. We had to fight to get back on it because the world wondered, ""Do we mean it still?"" The United States of America—do we mean it?</p>, <p>In December, I will host—the United States will host a virtual summit—a Summit of Democracies—to bring together world leaders to make concrete commitments to defend democratic values and push back against advancing authoritarianism, not war, but important words. We can't return to a world where might is right and strong nations abuse weak or oppress individual rights with impunity.</p>, <p>Nuremberg forced us to look closely at the evil of humankind and what we're capable of perpetrating, to see mass atrocities, crimes against humanity do not happen by accident. They don't happen by accident. They result of choices, choices made by individual human beings and world leaders.</p>, <p>And sadly, when we look around the world today, we cannot say that the specter of atrocity is behind us. We see today the patterns, the choices playing out around the world even as we speak: the oppression and use of forced labor of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang; the treatment of the Rohingya by the military junta in Burma; the rampant abuses, including the use of starvation and sexual violence, to terrorize civilian populations in Northern Ethiopia.</p>, <p>Whenever we hear that kind of poisonous hatred, wherever we see our fellow humans being dehumanized, it doesn't mean we go to war, but we must speak out. Silence—as my dad would remind me—silence is complicity. Silence is complicity. That's what Nuremberg said: Your silence is complicity.</p>, <p>I've raised these issues personally with leaders around the world—our friends and our adversaries alike—and I've made it clear that no U.S. President should stand by when human rights are under attack and maintain their legitimacy.</p>, <p>Those who we are—that's who we are as Americans. It's part of our DNA. We've fought, we've marched, we've sacrificed to ensure that rights are not reserved to just the wealthy or the powerful. They're the God-given inheritance of every person on this planet by virtue of our shared humanity.</p>, <p>As I said to a Supreme Court Justice who I disagreed with in a hearing—we have a different—you think I have my rights because the Constitution granted them to me. I possess my rights because I was born, and I gave up some of my rights in a constitution.</p>, <p>That's the radical idea at the core of the founding of our Nation, as I said, that all women and men are created equal, that we are all endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights. And those rights don't flow from the power of the Government; these rights exist for every individual. Period. Period. It is the job of the Government to protect them and to uphold them equally for all people.</p>, <p>We have never, as I said, fully lived up to that animating American ideal, but we've never turned our backs on it. In all the years since our founding, that idea has been our Nation's steady North Star, drawing us back on course. That constant struggle to live up to our highest domestic—democratic principles to self-correct has made us a beacon of hope for the rest of the world. It's also made us strong, resilient, innovative, dynamic.</p>, <p>As I said—and I'll repeat; I apologize—America is the only nation founded on an idea, the single most powerful idea in human history. It sparked our revolution. It helped ignite the wave of change around the world that successive generations have built on, expanding our understanding and extending protections to an ever-wider circle.</p>, <p>But we must never forget just how fragile the principle of universal human rights still is: how easily bruised, how often sacrificed in human battles for power and personal enrichment. In an age of increasing misinformation and disinformation, must—we must not grow complacent in our defense of the democratic values that have been the firm foundation for an era of peace and prosperity unprecedented—unprecedented—in human history.</p>, <p>Attacks on truth are still the harbinger of tyranny. Nothing about our democracy is assured, as I'm sure you've all begun to realize of late. Nothing about our freedom is guaranteed. We have to work for it. In those letters from Tom Dodd to his dear wife Grace reflecting his service at Nuremberg, he wrote: ""Sometimes, a man knows his duty so clearly, so surely, he cannot hesitate and he dare not refuse it.""</p>, <p>Tom Dodd lived a life with a clarity of purpose. He brought it to his service as U.S. Senator, leading the floor fights, with the Kennedys, on civil rights legislation in the sixties; advocating for gun safety in a State that was a major gun manufacturer, legislation that was ahead of its time; fighting always for human rights and democracy against the forces of oppression and injustice.</p>, <p>He passed that passion on to his children—and to his son Chris. Chris forward—carried forward his father's mantle in the United States Senate. He used it to fight for all American children and families, passing the first childcare act we've seen in this country since World War II, passing the Family and Medical Leave Act.</p>, <p>Chris railed against policies that militarized our relationships in Latin America and argued to instead recognize and invest in the people of our hemisphere. He spoke out when he saw the legacy of justice that his father had fought for in Nuremberg being wrapped in the excesses of a ""war on terror.""</p>, <p>And he helped to create this center, growing it over the years from an archival repository for the truth into a leading center for the study and promotion of human rights at home and abroad; into a widely respected academic institution, training the next generation of human rights defenders and passing the torch to those of you who will carry the fight on into the future and the—for the truth.</p>, <p>So, as we rededicate the Dodd Center for Human Rights to honor the legacies of both father and son, let's also dedicate it to the future of generations, to the students here in the audience today who will discover and defend human rights as the passion and purpose of our life.</p>, <p>So let us dedicate—be dedicated to expanding our shared understanding that we can never fully realize the freedom we wish for ourselves without also helping ensure that liberty and justice for everyone. And let's dedicate—let's dedicate—it to the unending fight to bring our own Nation, our own world closer to a future in which every human being is free to pursue the highest dreams and unleash their full potential.</p>, <p>And for you students that are here—undergraduates at this great institution—there's no reason why you will not be doing what I'm doing as President of the United States, standing here, speaking to audiences now. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I was taught—I came from very modest means; no Horatio Alger story, but very modest means—that you can be anything you set your mind to if you work at it.</p>, <p>So many of you in this audience, especially on the second tier there, are the people that my grandchildren are going to be looking to. There's not a single reason why—not a single reason why we can't do this. Not a single reason.</p>, <p>As I've told every world leader that I've gotten to know—and I've met many, many of them—it's never been a good bet to bet against the American people.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.</p>]"
6,5,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks at the Capitol Child Development Center in Hartford, Connecticut",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-capitol-child-development-center-hartford-connecticut,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Thank you, Barbara. As my colleagues have heard me say in a different venue, my mother would always say, ""You're doing God's work."" And you really are.</p>, <p>You know, I know that a lot of people are in desperate need of a facility like this in childcare. I didn't fully appreciate it as a young member of the county council when I was 27 years old. But when I got elected to the United States Senate when I was 29—it wasn't old enough to be sworn in yet—in the mean—between the time I got elected and the time I actually ultimately went to the Congress, I turned the eligible age of 30.</p>, <p>But also, in the meantime, I—there was an automobile accident that—my wife was Christmas shopping—and my daughter was killed, my wife was killed, and my two young boys, Beau and Hunter, were very badly injured and hospitalized for a long time. And so I didn't—I thought, ""Well, I'll get some help."" And I was making a decent salary as a U.S. Senator—$42,000 a year. That was a decent salary. And I could not afford the childcare.</p>, <p>Everybody wonders why I commuted every day, 265 miles a day, to be back and forth with my children. I could afford the train; it was cheaper to be able to take every day so I could kiss my boys. I mean, it wasn't ""Ozzie and Harriet,"" but we'd have breakfast in the morning and, when they got a little older, get them off to school. And I'd get on the train and come home in time to—if I got home in time to have dinner—they'd—it was seldom I'd get home in time to have my dinner, and they'd save their dessert, and I got to see them and kiss them goodnight and get in bed with them.</p>, <p>And so I—it made me realize how difficult it is for the vast majority of people who need help. I was lucky; I had a mother who was nearby, a sister who's my best friend who quit her job temporarily and moved in with her husband to help me raise my kids. And—but most people don't have that option. So I've been conscious of the concern and the lack of access and the lack of financial ability to have childcare for a long time.</p>, <p>And I want to thank the team here at the Capitol Development Center for welcoming us today. And I want to thank the excellent Connecticut leaders you have here. Ned, you're one of the best Governors in the United States of America. [<i>Applause</i>] No, you really are. You really are, because you stand up for what you believe in and you don't back down.</p>, <p>And Mr. Mayor—Luke—is an Afghan war veteran. We were talking about all the work he's done with the former Governor of Delaware, Jack Markell, now, who's placing Afghan refugees coming out of Afghanistan. And we're continuing to get people out. Thank you for what you do. I really mean it.</p>, <p>And Richard Blumenthal, who was, back in those days, the attorney general when my son Beau was still alive and he was attorney general. And not a joke, but he looked to Richard for help, and he gave it. And thanks for the way you took him under your wing. I really mean it, Richard. You were—it made a difference. You know what he thought of you.</p>, <p>And Chris Murphy, who has been not only a real soldier, but he has stood up and stuck up for me. And, Chris, you know, it matters. It matters when things are tight and you stand up and make the case, and I do appreciate it.</p>, <p>And John and I—John Larson and I go back a long way. [<i>Laughter</i>] And, Joe, you can't deny me. There's no way out. [<i>Laughter</i>] And Rosa DeLauro, who is—I don't have time; I don't want to keep you. But the first time I came up this way, I was—my son was going to Yale Law School, and her mother was a committeeman. Was it committeeman?</p>, <p><i>Representative Rosa L. DeLauro</i>. Alderwoman.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Alderwoman. And I was up on a ladder helping him paint the place he had just rented, and I—this knock on the door, and this lovely woman came and said: ""Where's Biden? Where's Joe Biden?"" [<i>Laughter</i>] And I was up on a ladder, and I had paint all over me, and I was a sitting U.S. Senator, and I said, ""I'm here."" She said, ""No, where's Biden?"" [<i>Laughter</i>] ""Where's Biden?""</p>, <p>And she brought the chief of police over to let him know that everything was going to be taken care of, and I'm going to—but your mother was something else. But you—that old expression, ""The apple doesn't fall far from the tree."" Rosie, you've been an incredible leader in all things having to do with the health and well-being of children and women. And we would not have had the legislation we're now trying to continue were it not for you.</p>, <p>And, Jim, you're the real deal. As well as, you know, Jahana. My—the comment I got from Jahana I get from everybody: ""Where's Jill?"" [<i>Laughter</i>] ""Where's Jill?"" I am Jill Biden's husband. [<i>Laughter</i>] She is now in—I think she's either in New Jersey or Virginia, I'm not sure, after teaching 15 credits this week at the community college. And she is out there making the case.</p>, <p>I'm here today to talk about what's fundamentally at stake right now, in my view, for the families not only of Connecticut—because you're ahead of the curve in some of what you've done on your own—but for our country.</p>, <p>For a long time, America set the pace across the globe. For most of the 21st century, we literally led the world by a significant margin in the investments we invested in our own people—in our people. Not only our roads, our highways, our bridges, but on our people and on our families.</p>, <p>And we didn't just build the Interstate Highway System and invest to win the space race. We also were among the first to provide access to free education beginning back at the turn of the 20th century. It was a distinction and a direct—a decision to invest in our children and our families, and it's a major reason why we were able to lead the world in the 21st century. We're one of the few nations in the world that had universal education for everyone, beginning in first—what was then first grade.</p>, <p>But somehow along the way, we sort of stopped investing in our people. Our infrastructure has fallen from the best in the world. According to the World Economic Forum, our infrastructure ranks 13th in the world: roads, bridges, highways, a whole range of things. But just as important is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development now ranks America 35 out of 37 major countries when it comes to investing in early childhood education and care. Say it another way: The world is catching up and beginning to pass us.</p>, <p>Jill has—my community college Dr. Biden has an expression she's used for real: Any country that outeducates us will outcompete us. Any country that outeducates us will outcompete us.</p>, <p>We cannot be competitive in the 21st century in this global economy if we fail to invest. That's why I proposed two critical pieces of legislation being debated in Washington right now. They're both bills—they're not about left versus right; they're not about, you know, moderate versus progressive or anything else that pits one American against another. These bills, in my view, are literally about competitiveness versus complacency, about opportunity versus decay, and about leading the world or continuing to let the world move by us.</p>, <p>Folks—a lot of folks know what's at stake in the infrastructure bill. It's about rebuilding the arteries of our economy, putting people to work in good-paying jobs. The estimates from Wall Street: It would create up to 16 million new jobs over time, good-paying jobs, union jobs. Not 5 bucks an hour, 7, 15, but $40, $50 an hour. You know, prevailing wage you can raise a family on, you can live with some dignity and pride.</p>, <p>Bringing our roads and bridges up to speed. Replacing lead water pipes. There's over 40,000 schools across America where you've got to be worried when you go to the water fountain whether there's lead in the water and the children are being poisoned. You can turn on the faucet so that every place in America you ensure the water is clean and able to be drunk.</p>, <p>Laying transmission lines for a modern and resilient energy grid. Making high-speed internet affordable and available everywhere in America, from urban, suburban, rural. There's parts of the country that are just being left behind. And there are parts of the country in States that are economically prosperous that are being left behind.</p>, <p>Meeting the moment on the climate crisis and, in the process, creating millions of good-paying jobs. You know, I've had a couple conferences already held; I'm going to COP26 in Scotland shortly. And what I had—I guess I had 71 heads of state on the first one I did in the White House. And I said—and people are starting to talk about it now, not about me, about the idea: When I think climate, I think jobs, good-paying jobs, union jobs.</p>, <p>This is an opportunity. We're the only country in the world that has consistently turned difficulty into opportunity. We have a chance to not only make this world more livable, but to actually create greater opportunity for people: making landmark investments in public transit and rail and increasing efficiency, reducing emissions.</p>, <p>You know, there's millions of kids getting on school—diesel school buses and inhaling air, getting asthma. We could—they should be electric buses—electric buses. That's going to happen.</p>, <p>So, look, I'm going to—I have a tendency to say more than I need to say, because you all understand it, but the bottom line is: I wanted to come here today because too many folks in Washington still don't realize it isn't enough just to invest in our physical infrastructure, we also have to invest in our people.</p>, <p>And that's what my second bill does, the Build Back Better bill—initiative. Seeing children and educators here at this center is a perfect reminder of what our families need for—and our economy needs so badly to be able to thrive.</p>, <p>You know, you all know the statistics, particularly the teachers here: A child coming out of a single-parent house where there's real difficulty will hear, literally, a million fewer words spoken—not different words—spoken—than the child coming out of a middle class household. And so, no matter what you say, you start them at the same age—at age 6 or 7, 5 or 6—in school, they're already behind the curve. Already behind the curve.</p>, <p>How can we compete in a world if millions of America's parents, especially moms, can't be part of the workforce because they can't afford the cost of childcare—or eldercare, I might add? Eldercare—they're the sandwich generation getting crushed.</p>, <p>Here in Connecticut, the average annual cost to bring your toddler to a quality childcare center is about $16,000 a year. That's what it is around the country—some places more, some places a little less. A lot of money. That's $16,000 after taxes—after you pay your taxes. So the average two-parent family with two young kids spends 26 percent of their income on childcare every year.</p>, <p>My Build Back Better plan is going to change that. It's going to cut the cost of childcare for most Connecticut families literally in half. No middle class family will pay more than 7 percent of their income on childcare. None. Period.</p>, <p>And that's going to help parents get back into the workforce and make ends meet or maybe care for that—we have to do the same—I'm not going to talk about it today, but the other piece of it, you all know, it deals with eldercare. You've got 80,000 people waiting to qualify under Medicaid, and there's no spaces. We can afford to do this.</p>, <p>But at any rate, we also have to provide businesses with tax credits to build onsite care facilities. Look, you, in the legislature, were way ahead of the curve. You decided that for people working in the legislature, there should be a place for their children.</p>, <p>Well, you know, what we want to do is make sure that we encourage businesses to do the same, to get a significant tax cut to be able, if they have an onsite facility, to take of their workers' children when they show up. So you go to work with your child, and you have a serious facility onsite.</p>, <p>Well, studies show that when you have onsite care for—a children's center, businesses—businesses, the business itself—have less employee turnover, less absenteeism, and higher productivity. We can show you all those studies. It's real. We can't afford to lag behind other countries when they're investing in.</p>, <p>When America made 12 years of public education universal more than a century ago, it gave the best educated, best prepared workforce in the world to the rest of the world. But if we were designing public education today, we—all of a sudden, we had none, we said: ""Okay, what are we going to do? We need free public education."" Does anybody think we'd think 12 years was enough, in the second quarter of the 21st century?</p>, <p>The fact is, today, only about half of 3- and 4-year-olds in America are enrolled in early education childhood—childhood education, like you're doing here. In Germany, France, and the U.K., even Latvia, the number of children in those countries enrolled is 90 percent—90 percent.</p>, <p>My plan gets us back on track. It provides 2 years of high-quality preschool for every child in America. It also makes investments in higher education by increasing Pell grants. I don't know that I can get it done, but I also had proposed free community college, like you've done here in the State of Connecticut, to help students from lower income families attend community colleges and 4-year schools. It invests in Historically Black Colleges and Universities to make sure young people from every neighborhood have a shot at good-paying jobs in the future. We also extend this lady's child tax credit—[<i>laughter</i>]—which is finally a tax cut for the middle class.</p>, <p>Now, look, my friends on the other side never had any problem for adding $2 trillion in tax cuts for the very wealthy. Look, I don't think you shouldn't be able to make a million or a billion dollars. I'm a capitalist. But guess what? I'm also listed for 36 years as the poorest man in the Congress. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I make big money now; I'm a President. [<i>Laughter</i>] But all kidding aside, I don't think we should punish anybody. But just pay your fair share. Just pay your fair share.</p>, <p>You know, the issue that has been championed by Rosa for years—in the past, if you paid taxes and had an income high enough that you were able to take the $2,000-per-child deduction, you could actually write it off your taxes.</p>, <p>But how many families do you know of cops and firefighters and schoolteachers and the like that don't have—pay that much in tax because—they pay a tax, but there's nothing—you say you're going to get $4,000 back for your kids. Well, you know, it's not refundable. It either comes off your tax bill, or you don't get it at all.</p>, <p>The American Rescue Plan, which these folks voted for as well, and I'm very proud of—it's sort of a real game changer and started our economy moving again—recognizes that people with lower incomes don't get the benefit of that tax rate because they don't have that much to deduct, so we make it refundable. We make it permanently refundable.</p>, <p>So you'd get that back over the years. You get—if you didn't have—if you only had $1,000 in taxes and you had three kids, you'd end up in a situation where you'd get $5,000 refundable to you. They would pay you; the Government would pay you. And we increased that amount in the near term to $3,600 for every child under the age of 6; to $3,000 for dependents between the ages of 6 and 17.</p>, <p>The money is already a game changer for working families. It's projected to cut child poverty in Connecticut—one of the wealthier States, like Delaware—in Connecticut, by 40 percent.</p>, <p>If we don't pass the Build—[<i>applause</i>]—I mean, for real. It's a life changer. The Build Back Better Act says that you get the first half of it paid to you, and then the second half you get paid on a monthly basis. People are getting—hard-working families are getting a check in the mail on the 15th—today's the 15th, isn't it?—or their bank account, just like you get your Social Security check, but it's for your children. It's for being able to raise your kids.</p>, <p>That monthly tax cut for parents is going to end in just a couple of months. And it's going to impact families of 61 million kids right at the holidays when the winter heating costs are going up, when we need to keep the taxes for families going down.</p>, <p>The bottom line is this: When you give working families a break, we don't—we're not just raising their quality of life; we're positioning our country to compete in the future.</p>, <p>You know, when I talked to all your folks out in the playground, and as I joked, everybody knows I like kids better than people—fortunately, they like me. That's why, maybe, I like them. [<i>Laughter</i>] But all kidding aside, you all talked about it. You talked about what it means to the families of these children. And granted, you had to cut way back, and because of a lot of things happening, things aren't the same as they were.</p>, <p>But these bills are about strengthening the economy for decades to come. Both of these bills spend out over 10 years. Take the infrastructure bill: All those investments in roads, bridges, highways, high-speed internet, water—clean water—everything would represent less than one-half of 1 percent of our economy each year if you add it all up over those years. And the cost of the Build Back Better bill, in terms of adding to the deficit, is zero.</p>, <p>So, when I hear people say it costs $3.5 trillion—and to be honest with you, we're probably not going to get $3.5 trillion this year; we're going to get something less than that. But I'm going to negotiate. I'm going to get it done ""with the grace of God and the good will of the neighbors and the creek not rising,"" as my grandpop would say. [<i>Laughter</i>] But all kidding aside, we're going to keep coming and—because the more we demonstrate it works, the more we can do.</p>, <p>It's paid for because big corporations and the very wealthy ought to start paying their fair share. Let me be clear: Nobody—and I—since I got elected, and when I was campaigning—nobody who makes under $400,000 a year, which is a lot of money, will see their taxes go up one single penny. Nobody. Not one. That's why, in the highway bill, I didn't add gas tax, so I could keep that commitment. In fact, this plan cuts taxes for working people.</p>, <p>There is no reason why, as I said, billionaires should pay a lower tax rate—literally a lower tax rate—than a schoolteacher and a firefighter, a couple. So—and that's what's happening now.</p>, <p>It isn't right that 55 of our Fortune 400 [500]* companies—the largest companies in America—last year, 55 of the five—Fortune 500 paid zero in taxes, and they made $40 billion in profit. I'm glad they made a profit. Keep people employed. I mean that sincerely, but pay your fair share. Just pay a decent portion of what we lay out in these—this piece of legislation.</p>, <p>And by the way, I've had a number of Fortune 500 companies come to me and say: ""You're right. We can pay a higher tax than we're paying now."" Because they understand the impact if we don't invest like we have to on their long-term health and well-being.</p>, <p>This needs to change. Working folks understand it. That's why, despite the attacks and misinformation, my plan still has the overwhelming support of the American people when they're told what's in it. They understand that when families have a little more breathing room, America has a lot better shot.</p>, <p>My dad used to say—for real—my dad was a well-read, well-bred man who was—regretted his whole life he never got a chance to go to college. And he worked like heck. He'd always come home for dinner and then go back to work.</p>, <p>And I remember, we lived in a four-bedroom, split-level home with four kids and a grandpop. And you know, my bed was against the wall where my parents' bed was against the adjacent wall. I remember, one night, I could tell my dad was just so restless. I was in high school. The next morning, I asked my mom, I said, ""What's the matter with Dad, Mom?"" She said, ""Well, honey, he—his company just told him they're going to do away with health insurance—no health insurance.""</p>, <p>Well, you know what? My dad's not—we weren't poor. We were—my dad made, probably, on average, in those days, $20-, $22-, $25,000 dollars a year, which is a decent salary. But he used to say: ""Everybody is entitled to just a little bit of breathing room. Just a little bit."" A little bit of breathing room. You know, they know this is about dignity and respect. It's about building this economy from the bottom up and the middle out.</p>, <p>I've never seen a time—and some of you may have—beyond my colleagues in the Congress and in the press—may have your Master's or Doctor degrees in economics. Name me a single time in American history when the middle class was doing well that the wealthy didn't do very, very well. Name me a time. One single time in American history. So we're not hurting anybody; we're just making sure everybody gets a shot.</p>, <p>Let me close with this, and this is not hyperbole: The world is watching. Autocrats believe that the world is moving so rapidly that democracies cannot generate consensus quickly enough to get things done. Not a joke. I've had these—I've had hours and hours and hours of meetings and personal conversations with Xi Jinping.</p>, <p>I spent more time with him, I believe, than any other world leader has, when I was Vice President and now, on the phone. Every time he calls or we talk to one another, it's an hour—it's a conversation between an hour and a half and 2½ hours. Not a joke. My word. But he doesn't think democracies can compete, because they can't react quickly enough. In my summit with Putin in Switzerland, they're betting democracies can't compete, we can't move quickly enough.</p>, <p>I'm heading to the G-20, came back from the G-7. You know how they measure? They don't measure us based on the size of our military. They don't measure us on how much power we have that way. They measure—want to know can we get anything done. Not a joke. And you—many of you travel internationally. Can we get anything done? ""Can you put anything together to get something done in America?""</p>, <p>So, folks, they're betting that we won't respond to this inflection point in history. But I've always said, and I mean it—some of you guys who work with me know this. I've said it a thousand times: It's never a good bet to get—to bet against the American people. Never a good bet.</p>, <p>So it's time for us to invest in ourselves, show the world that American democracy works. We've always led the world not by the example of our physical power, but by the power of our example. That's why the world has followed. And given, as I said, half a chance, there's not a single, solitary thing that we can't achieve if we do it together.</p>, <p>So I'm hopeful. There's a lot of questions the press is going to want to ask me, I know, about how are the negotiations going and are we going to get this done and so on. Well, I told you before what my neurosurgeon years ago said when I had that aneurysm. He said, ""Your problem""—and I was then a Senator—""Your problem, Senator, is you're a congenital optimist.""</p>, <p>But I'm convinced we're going to get this done. I'm convinced we're going to get it done. We're not going to get $3.5 trillion. We'll get less than that, but we're going to get it. And we're going to come back and get the rest.</p>, <p>So I want to thank you all. And God bless you. And I know you're asking me about President Clinton. I've been changing—exchanging calls. He seems to be, God willing——</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President knocked on the podium.</i>]</p>, <p>——doing well. And so, when I talk to him, I'll let you all know.</p>, <p>But in the meantime, thank you for taking the time to be here. And I've—I say this again, and the press heard me say it: For all you elected officials, it's like a busman's holiday for you. [<i>Laughter</i>] Coming to have to listen to another politician speak.</p>, <p>But I am really—and I mean this without exception—I'm so proud to be associated with each one of you. You're honorable, decent, smart women and men. And there's a lot we can get done. So thank you very much.</p>]"
6,6,Joseph R.

It's an honor to welcome you to the White House, to the Oval Office. Good to see you again.</p>, <p>And you know, the U.S.-Kenya strategic partnership is essential—we both, I think, believe is essential to addressing key regional and global challenges.</p>, <p>And I want to thank Kenya for your—thank you for your leadership in defending the peace, security, and democratic instincts of the region and your country. You're doing a heck of a job.</p>, <p>And now you are—you know, Kenya is currently the President of the U.N. Security Council.</p>, <p><i>President Kenyatta.</i> Right. That's right.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> I mean, thanks for letting us stay in. [<i>Laughter</i>]<i> </i>But all kidding aside, thank you. Thank you very much.</p>, <p>And we're continuing our shared fight against COVID. The United States has donated 2.8 million doses of vaccine to Kenya as part of the 50 million doses we've donated to the African Union.</p>, <p>And I'm proud to announce that—today, that we're making an additional, historic, one-time donation of 17 more million doses of J&amp;J vaccine to the AU, and we're going to be sending some more of these by the end of the year to Kenya.</p>, <p>And today we're going to discuss what more Kenya and the United States can do together on the Horn of Africa to advance peace and security.</p>, <p>And we're also going to talk about strengthening the financial transparency and accelerating economic growth. You've spoken to that, Mr. President; I want to talk to you about that. And the fight against climate change.</p>, <p>So our nations share a deep commitment to fairness and to respect and equity. And I'm committed to further elevating our ties with Kenya and nations across Africa as a whole. But Kenya is key to this.</p>, <p>So, welcome, Mr. President. And I'm delighted to have you here.</p>, <p><i>President Kenyatta.</i> Thank you very much, Mr. President. And let me once again say it's a great pleasure to see you once again.</p>, <p>I don't know whether many will recall, but President Biden, in a former life, visited Kenya where we had an opportunity to meet when he was Vice President, when he had come over, again, on issues related to strengthening the partnership and the relationship between our two countries. And it's really a great pleasure and honor to see you again.</p>, <p>Let me also take this opportunity, through you, to thank your Government and the people of the United States. During this very difficult time, the United States has done its best to step up in terms of not only helping Kenya, but the African Continent in general, with regard to access to vaccines.</p>, <p>I'm happy to hear your new announcement of that increase, because as many of you will know, as a continent, we are lagging well behind the rest of the world in terms of being able to vaccinate our people. So any additional support, like the President has just mentioned, is greatly welcomed, and we look forward to that continued partnership.</p>, <p>We're also very closely partnering, especially in regard to the fight against terrorism globally. The United States has been a very strong partner to Kenya in that particular fight. And this is an area, again, I'm hoping to have an opportunity to further discuss with the President.</p>, <p>We are also keenly very grateful with his strong position, especially with regard to climate change. This is an area where Kenya has made tremendous progress in her own right and where we are firmly committed to the Paris Agreement, and we're glad to see the United States has now rejoined.</p>, <p>And we look forward to working very closely together on that particular agenda, which, as you know, our country, our continent is the least in terms of emitting, but pays the highest price.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>President Kenyatta.</i> So we welcome your leadership in this area, and I look forward to having the opportunity to discuss that further with you.</p>, <p>Keenly, also, wanting to engage, as we have been already, with the President on the issue of trade and investment between our two countries. This, I believe, is vital not only in terms of further entrenching American interests on the continent, but also in helping us also achieve our social-economic agenda. So that's another agenda that we are also going to be engaged in.</p>, <p>So, Mr. President, let me just say it's wonderful to see you again. It's wonderful to be back here. And I look forward to fruitful deliberations as we move forward.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> So do I. Thank you.</p>, <p>Thank you all.</p>]"
6,7,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-covid-19-response-and-national-vaccination-efforts-2,"[<p><i>The President. </i>Good afternoon. I've just been briefed by my COVID-19 team on the progress we're making on our fight against the virus. Today I want to provide a brief update on my plan that I announced in early September to accelerate the path out of this pandemic.</p>, <p>It's working. We're making progress. Nationally, daily cases are down 47 percent; hospitalizations are down 38 percent over the past 6 weeks. Over the past 2 weeks, most of the country has improved as well. Case rates are declining in 39 States, and hospital rates are declining in 38 States. We're down to 66 million—it's still an unacceptably high number—of unvaccinated people from almost 100 million in July.</p>, <p>That's important. It's important progress. But it's not—now is not the time to let up. We have a lot more to do. We're in a very critical period as we work to turn the corner on COVID-19.</p>, <p>First, we have to do more to vaccinate the 66 million unvaccinated people in America. It's essential. The vaccine requirements that we started rolling out in the summer are working. They're working.</p>, <p>The Labor Department is going to soon be issuing an emergency rule for companies with a hundred or more employees to implement vaccination requirements in their—among their workforce. Every day, we see more businesses implementing vaccination requirements, and the mounting data shows that they work. Businesses and organizations that are implementing requirements are seeing their vaccination rates rise by an average of 20 percent or more to well over 90 percent—the number of employees vaccinated.</p>, <p>Let's be clear: Vaccination requirements should not be another issue that divides us. That's why we continue to battle the misinformation that's out there, and companies and communities are setting up their—stepping up as well to combat these—the misinformation. Southwest Airlines at—the head of the pilot—the head of the pilot's union and its CEO dismissed critics who claim vaccination mandates contributed to flight disruptions. School board members, religious leaders, and doctors across the country are fighting misinformation and educating people about the importance of vaccines. All of these efforts are going to help us continue moving the dial to eliminate this disease.</p>, <p>Second, we're going to continue protecting the vaccinated. This work—this week, the Food and Drug Administration and—the FDA is reviewing data on Moderna and Johnson and Johnson boosters. We expect a final decision from the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, in the next couple of weeks. If they authorize the boosters, which will be strictly made based on the science—that decision will be based on the science—this will mean all three vaccines will be available for boosters.</p>, <p>Already, more than one out of three eligible seniors have gotten their third shot, the booster. And we're going to continue to provide that additional protection to seniors and others as we head into the holidays. These boosters are free. I'll say it again: They're free, available, and convenient to get.</p>, <p>Third point I'd like to make: We need to continue to keep our schools and our students safe. Ninety-six percent of school districts are fully open with children back in the classroom and—for in-person learning. We have been able to do this because we've provided our schools the resources they need to protect children and the educators, as well as the staff that works in the schools. We've been encouraging schools to implement important health measures like masking, testing, and getting everyone vaccinated who is eligible to be vaccinated.</p>, <p>Now, I know parents out there are anxiously waiting for a vaccine for children ages 5 to 11. The good news is, the FDA and outside experts from the CDC are set to make its determination as to whether the vaccine will be authorized for that age range in the next few weeks. If authorized, we are ready. We have purchased enough vaccines for all children between the ages of 5 and 11 in the United States. And we'll be—it will be convenient for parents to get their children vaccinated at trusted locations, and families will be able to sleep easier at night knowing their kids are protected as well.</p>, <p>Let me close with this: The plan I laid out in September is working. We're headed in the right direction. We have critical work to do, but we can't let up now. My team and I are doing everything we can. But I'm calling on more businesses to step up. I'm calling on more parents to get their children vaccinated when they are eligible. And I'm asking everyone—everyone who hasn't gotten vaccinated: Please get vaccinated.</p>, <p>That's how we put this pandemic behind us and accelerate our economic recovery. We can do this.</p>, <p>I've said many times: God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you very much.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, have you decided on an FDA Commissioner?</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President—[<i>inaudible</i>]—sir?</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, what's your message to the John Deere workers on strike?</p>]"
6,8,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on Efforts To Address Global Supply Chain Bottlenecks,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-efforts-address-global-supply-chain-bottlenecks,"[<p>Please, sit down. Thank you. Well, good afternoon, everyone.</p>, <p>I know you're hearing a lot about something called supply chains and how hard it is to get a range of things from a toaster to sneakers to a bicycle to bedroom furniture. And that's why, back in February, I signed a piece of legislation on supply chain—an Executive order on supply chains. And, well, we had to move on it.</p>, <p>And with the holidays coming up, you might be wondering if the gifts you planned to buy will arrive on time.</p>, <p>Well, let me explain: ""Supply chains"" essentially mean how we make things and how the material and parts get delivered to factory—a factory so we can manufacture things and manufacture them here; how we move things, how a finished product moves from a factory to a store to your home. And today we have an important announcement that will get things you buy to you, to the shelves faster. I'm joined by the executive directors of the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, Gene Seroka and Mario Cordono [Cordero].* I missed—I apologize, Mario. That the—and the president of the International Longshoremen's Union, Willie Adams.</p>, <p>Los Angeles and Long Beach are home to two of the largest point—ports in America. And together, these ports are among the largest in the world. And the best way to make that point is that 40 percent—40 percent—of shipping containers that we import into this country come through these two ports. And today we have some good news: We're going to help speed up the delivery of goods all across America.</p>, <p>After weeks of negotiation and working with my team and with the major union and retailers and freight movers, the Ports of Los Angeles—the Port of Los Angeles announced today that it's going to be—begin operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This follows the Port of Long Beach's commitment to 24/7 that it announced just weeks ago.</p>, <p>Twenty-four/seven system—what most of the leading countries in the world already operate on now, except us, until now. This is the first key step toward moving our entire freight transportation and logistical supply chain, nationwide, to a 24/7 system.</p>, <p>And here's why it matters: Traditionally, our ports have only been open during the week, Monday through Friday, and they're generally closed down at nights and on weekends. By staying open 7 days a week, through the night and on the weekends, the Port of Los Angeles will open—over 60 extra hours a week, it will be open. In total, that will almost double the number of hours that the port is open for business from earlier this year.</p>, <p>That means an increase in the hours for workers to be moving cargo off ships onto trucks and railcars to get to their destination. And more than that, the night hours are critical for increasing the movement of goods because highways—highways—are less crowded in the evening—at night. In fact, during off-peak hours in Los Angeles, cargo leaves the port at a 25-percent faster pace than during the day shift.</p>, <p>So, by increasing the number of late-night hours of operation and opening up for less crowded hours when the goods can move faster, today's announcement has the potential to be a game-changer. I say ""potential,"" because all of these goods won't move by themselves. For the positive impact to be felt all across the country and by all of you at home, we need major retailers who ordered the goods and the freight movers who take the goods from the ships to factories and to stores to step up as well. These private sector companies are the ones that hire the trucks and railcars and move the goods.</p>, <p>On this score, we have some good news to report as well. Today Walmart, our Nation's largest retailer, is committing to go all in on moving this product—its products 24/7 from the ports to their stores nationwide. Specifically, Walmart is committing as much as a 50-percent increase in the use of off-peak hours over the next several weeks.</p>, <p>Additionally, FedEx and UPS, two of our Nation's biggest freight movers, are committing today to significantly increase the amount of goods they are moving at night. FedEx and UPS are the shippers for some of our Nation's largest stores, but they also ship for tens of thousands of small businesses all across America. Their commitment to go all in on 24/7 operations means that businesses of all sizes will get their goods on shelves faster and more reliably. Accordingly—according to one estimate: Together, FedEx and UPS alone move up to 40 percent of packages in America—up to 40 percent.</p>, <p>And other companies are stepping up as well. They include Target, Home Depot, and Samsung that have all committed to ramp up their activities to utilize off-peak hours at the ports. So the commitments being made today are a sign of major progress in moving goods from manufacturers to a store or to your front door.</p>, <p>I want to thank my Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force, which we set up in June, led by Secretaries Buttigieg, Raimondo, and Vilsack, and by my Director of National Economic Council, Brian Deese. I want to thank them for their leadership. And I especially want to thank Joe [John]* Porcari. And I think Joe [John] has done one heck of job—my special Envoy, specifically on ports, who has been working this issue with all of the stakeholders for the past several weeks.</p>, <p>I also want to thank the port directors. I want to thank Gene and Mario again and the mayors of Los Angeles and Long Beach, Mayor Garcetti and Mayor Garcia, for their leadership. And I think the private companies that are stepping up—I want to thank them. Thank them.</p>, <p>But I particularly want to thank labor: Willie Adams of the Longshoremen and Warehouses Union, who is here today; the Teamsters; the rail unions, from the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen and the International Association of Machinists, to the American Train Dispatchers Association, to Sheet Metal, Air, and Rail, and Transportation Workers Union, known as SMART.</p>, <p>I want to be clear: This is across-the-board commitment to going to 24/7. This is a big first step in speeding up the movement of materials and goods through our supply chain. But now we need the rest of the private sector chain to step up as well. This is not called a ""supply chain"" for nothing. This means the terminal operators, railways, trucking companies, shippers, and other retailers as well.</p>, <p>Strengthening our supply chain will continue to be my team's focus. If Federal support is needed, I will direct all appropriate action. And if the private sector doesn't step up, we're going to call them out and ask them to act. Because our goal is not only to get through this immediate bottleneck, but to address the longstanding weaknesses in our transportation supply chain that this pandemic has exposed.</p>, <p>I might add, parenthetically: One of the reasons why I think it's very important that we get the infrastructure plan passed—my infrastructure plan—and that's the supply chain system is almost entirely in the hands of private business.</p>, <p>The world has changed. Prior to the crisis, we cheered, you know, the focus on lean, efficient supply chains, leaving no buffer or margin for error when it comes to certain parts arriving just in time, as needed to make a final product. And the—our administration—Barack's and ours—we—that's when it was—""just in time"" was the focus. We didn't have a pandemic and other things at the time.</p>, <p>We need to take a longer view, though, that invests in building greater resilience to withstand the kinds of shocks we've seen over and over, year in and year out, whether it's the pandemic, extreme weather, climate change, cyber attacks, or other disruptions. In fact, research tells us that a company can expect to lose over 40 percent of 1 year's earnings every 10 years due to supply chain disruptions.</p>, <p>A longer term view means we invest in systems that have more time built in and in our ability to produce, innovate, and partner with our allies. It also means companies throughout the supply chain—like maritime, air freight, and trucking companies—reduce their carbon emissions and help to meet our climate change goals.</p>, <p>It also means creating and supporting good-paying jobs so folks want to stay in these jobs, so they can build the skills and careers and to make a decent living. It means more opportunities to join a union, especially for truckers. These steps are critical. They allow companies to pivot quickly when a disruption hits because they've invested in their workers, their workers' skills, and training upfront to be able to adapt.</p>, <p>We need to invest in making more of our products right here in the United States. Never again should our country and our economy be unable to make critical products we need because we don't have access to materials to make that product. Never again should we have to rely too heavily on one company or one country or one person in the world, particularly when countries don't share our values when it comes to labor and environmental standards.</p>, <p>I've said before: We're in the competition for the 21st century. We are America. We still have the most productive workers and the most innovative minds in the world. But the rest of the world is closing in, and we risk losing our edge if we don't step up. In order to be globally competitive, we need to improve our capacity to make things here in America while also moving finished products across the country and around the world.</p>, <p>We need to think big and bold. That's why I'm pushing for a once-in-a-generation investment in our infrastructure and our people with my infrastructure bill and my Build Back Better Act. These bills would transform our ports—there's millions—billions of dollars for ports—highways, rail systems that sorely need upgrading and would bring products faster and more efficiently from the factories to the store to your house.</p>, <p>Let me be clear: We're proposing to make the biggest investment in ports in our history. The bill would also make investments in our supply chains and manufacturing and strengthening our ability to make more goods, from the beginning to end, right here in America.</p>, <p>The bottom line: We've seen the cost of inaction in the pandemic in the delays and the congestion that affect every American. But it's fully within our capacity to act to make sure it never happens again—it's going to take a little time—and that we unlock the full might and dynamism of our economy and our people. That's what we're going to do.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and may God bless the longshoremen, rail workers, truckers, and all the workers who are keeping our economy going. And may God protect our troops.</p>, <p>Thank you all so very much.</p>]"
6,9,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on Restoring Protections for National Monuments,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-restoring-protections-for-national-monuments,"[<p>Good afternoon. Please, all be seated. Please.</p>, <p>Madam Secretary—Deb, you've done an incredible job in a short amount of time. And I told you, when I asked you to be Secretary of Interior, that I understood—I was politically raised by Danny Inouye—Indian Nations. Indian Nations. And I want to thank all the leaders that are here today for your support, for your help getting this done. And it's really, really important.</p>, <p>And I want to thank Brenda, the Council on Economic Quality—Environmental Quality; and Gina McCah-thy. [<i>Laughter</i>] If you need any translation, talk to me after. Gina, you're the best. You're the best.</p>, <p>And I want you to know, although he didn't speak today, I want to thank my buddy, Tom Vilsack, the Secretary of Agriculture, for being here today, because he's about preservation.</p>, <p>And, Maria, Senator Cantwell, thank you for your really hard, consistent, unrelenting work on these issues. And I also want to thank Michael Bennet the same way. He's been in this and never—from the moment he got elected, has been pushing, pushing hard.</p>, <p>And, Ruben. I want to thank you, Congressman Gallego, for the work you've done and continue to do. I really mean it.</p>, <p>This may be the easiest thing I've ever done—[<i>laughter</i>]—so far as President. No, I mean it. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean it.</p>, <p>I've got to tell you a quick story. When I was running for office—and I'm going to—I'm embarrassed I can't remember exactly which State I was in—but a gentleman and I think it was his wife and a little girl said, ""Could I""—the little girl said, ""Could I talk to you?"" And she had this—I couldn't tell—understand what she had in her hand; it looked it a teddy bear or something. And she said, ""Can I talk to you, mister?"" She wasn't sure what to call me because I wasn't elected yet, ""Mr. President"" or ""Mr. Vice President.""</p>, <p>I said: ""Sure. What's the matter, honey?"" She said: ""I want to give you something. I want to give you some bears ears."" And I looked at her. And she gave me this little set of bears ears. She said: ""You've got to promise me. You've got to promise me you'll protect the Bears Ears."" And I'm thinking, ""What the heck is""—[<i>laughter</i>]. I mean, at the time—I knew Bears Ears, but I just didn't quite get it.</p>, <p>She said—and her dad said, ""You know, the national park."" I said, ""Oh, yes."" She said—and she—one look, she said, ""You pwromise?"" [<i>Laughter</i>] ""You pwromise?"" And I pwromised. And it's easiest promise that I've made in a long time.</p>, <p>And I'm grateful to the Tribal Nation leaders and both those who are here with us today and those who are unable to join us.</p>, <p>Today I am proud to announce the protection and expansion of three of the most treasured national monuments—our most treasured—based on powers granted to the President under the Antiquities Act first used more than a century ago by Teddy Roosevelt.</p>, <p>First, Bears Ears National Monument in Utah. This is the first national monument in the country to be established at the request of federally recognized Tribes, and a place of healing, as was spoken by the Secretary; a place of reverence; a sacred homeland to hundreds of generations of Native Peoples.</p>, <p>The last administration reduced the size by 85 percent, leaving vulnerable more than 1 million acres of cherished landscape. Today I'm—we'll shortly by signing a proclamation to fully restore the boundaries of Bears Ears.</p>, <p>And second, I am restoring Utah's Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, a place of unique and extraordinary geology, as well as biodiversity, established as a national monument 25 years ago this [last]* month. Over the last quarter-century, this land has produced a significant scientific discoveries per acre than—more than any other national monument, everything from fossils to ancient indigenous artifacts.</p>, <p>And once again, the last administration cut the size of the monument nearly in half, stripping away more than 800,000 protected acres. Today I'm signing a proclamation to restore it to its full glory.</p>, <p>Third, off the coast of New England, I am restoring protection to the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, waters teeming with life, with underwater canyons as deep as parts of the Grand Canyon and underwater mountains as tall as the Appalachians. There's nothing like it in the whole world. Because its unique biodiversity, marine scientists believe that this is key to understanding life under the sea.</p>, <p>President Obama established it as a national monument 5 years ago, recognizing its irreplaceable value. Again, my predecessor chipped away at its protections. The proclamation I'll be signing today is going to restore the protections established by President Obama when this monument was first created.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President cleared his throat</i>.]</p>, <p>Excuse me. The protection of public lands must become—must not become, I should say, a pendulum that swings back and forth depending on who's in public office. It's not a partisan issue. And I want to thank the Members of Congress who have come together to support this important conservation work.</p>, <p>And by the way, I might add, as a matter of courtesy, I spoke with both the Senators from Utah. They were—they didn't agree with what I was doing, but they were gracious and polite about it. And I appreciate that as well.</p>, <p>The truth is, national monuments and parks are part of the identity as—our identity as a people. They are more than natural wonders, they're the birthright we pass from generation to generation, a birthright of every American. And preserving them is the fulfillment of a promise to our children and all those who will come to leave this world a little better than we found it.</p>, <p>But today, our children are three times more likely to see climate disasters uproot and unsettle their lives than their grandparents' generation. We have to come together and understand why this work is so critical. When we protect and care for a forest, we're not just preserving the majesty of nature. We're safeguarding water sources and lessening the impact of fires—excuse me——</p>, <p>[<i>The President</i> <i>coughed.</i>]</p>, <p>——the impact of fires. We're protecting wetlands. We're not only saving birds and fish and the livelihoods of people who depend on them, we're also shoring up the natural defenses to absorb the fury of hurricanes and superstorms.</p>, <p>Nearly one in three Americans live in a community that has been struck by weather disasters just in the last few months: hurricanes, wildfires, droughts, heat waves. Both the Build Back Better plan and my bipartisan infrastructure agreement are going to make critical investments, significantly increasing the resilience to these devastating effects on the climate crisis.</p>, <p>It includes creation of a Civilian Climate Corps, similar to President Franklin Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps, which is going to put diverse groups of Americans to work, doing everything from restoring wetlands, to protecting clean water, to making forests more resilient against wildfires.</p>, <p>My plan also puts Americans on a course to achieve 50- to 52-percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and to reach net-zero emissions no later than 2050.</p>, <p>You know, achieving these ambitious goals is going to require that nature itself play a role.</p>, <p>Scientists estimate that the protection and restoration of national lands and waters can provide nearly 40 percent of the solutions to climate change. That's why I'm signing these proclamations today as an additional reason.</p>, <p>It's also why I'm restoring protections for the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, which I've had the great honor to visit. As a matter of fact, when I was meeting with—back in the days when the Senator from Alaska—I was with him after the oil spill on the North Slope. And we stopped in the Tongass forest, and he sat me at a table in this magnificent restaurant in the middle of the Tongass forest, which has tree trunks as big as those trees holding up the whole building. It's magnificent.</p>, <p>And he sat me with what I—kidding—call ""Hoss Cartwright and his family""—four big guys—really big, big guys. And they were—had a lumber company that they were foresting in the area. And they wanted me to support paying for roads into the national forest so they could forest.</p>, <p>And we started the conversation. And to make a long story short, when I made it clear I wasn't going to do that, a father turned to his son who looked like that program—a Hoss Cartwright—big fella. And he said, ""I'll bet""—I won't use the exact language. He turned to me—I'm across the table, and he's just got—he and three of his sons. And he said, ""I'll bet this so and so""—referring to me—and expletive deleted. [<i>Laughter</i>] ""He doesn't realize he's closer to Lexington, Kentucky, today than he was when he just flew off the North Slope.""</p>, <p>And it made the point to me: Alaska is pretty big. There's an awful lot we need to protect. [<i>Laughter</i>] But that's why I'm working to protect Bristol Bay from mining operations that would threaten one of the world's largest salmon runs. That's why I'm refusing to sell out the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve to oil and gas drilling.</p>, <p>These protections provide a bridge to our past, but they also build a bridge to a safer, more sustainable future, one where we strengthen our economy and pass on a healthy planet to our children and our grandchildren.</p>, <p>Let me close with this: Edward Abbey, a writer who once worked as a ranger at the Arches National Park in Utah, wrote, and I quote: ""This is the most beautiful place on Earth. There are many such places. Every man, every woman, carries in heart and mind the image of the ideal place, the right place, the one true home, known or unknown, actual or visionary."" End of quote.</p>, <p>Folks, that's the United States of America—that's America—a country we all share together, a country that we must protect together. And this is just one more step in doing what other Presidents have done, starting with Teddy Roosevelt.</p>, <p>And I'm now going to sign these proclamations. And thank you, all. Thank you all for your support. Thank you. Come on.</p>, <p>[<i>The President moved to the signing desk and signed the proclamations</i>.]</p>]"
7,0,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Report on the Employment Situation in September,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-bureau-labor-statistics-report-the-employment-situation-september,"[<p>Hello, folks. Good afternoon, everyone.</p>, <p>Today, for the first time since March of 2020, the American unemployment rate is below 5 percent. In just 8 months since I became President, in the midst of a grave public health and economic crisis, the unemployment rate is now down below 5 percent, at 4.8 percent. Let me just repeat that: Today's report has the unemployment rate down to 4.8 percent, a significant improvement from when I took office and a sign that our recovery is moving forward even in the face of a COVID pandemic.</p>, <p>That improvement was widespread: Unemployment for Hispanic workers was down, and the unemployment rate for African Americans fell almost a full percent, and it's now below 8 percent for the first time in 17 months. A drop of 496,000 in long-term unemployment is the second largest single-month drop since we started keeping records. The largest was in July.</p>, <p>So, in the past 3 months, we've seen a drop of 1.3 million long-term unemployed. That's the largest 3-month fall in long-term unemployment since we started keeping records in 1948. More to do, but great progress.</p>, <p>And working Americans are seeing their paychecks go up as well. In September, we saw one of the largest increases in average wages paid to workers on—of working Americans on record. Today's report comes 1 day after the Labor Department found, in the third quarter of this year, the number of layoffs and job reductions was the lowest in this country since 1997.</p>, <p>Overall, the unemployment report shows that almost 200,000 jobs were created last month—over 300,000 in the private sector and 26,000 in manufacturing—offset by some seasonal adjustments in education hiring.</p>, <p>The monthly totals bounce around, but if you take a look at the trend, it's solid. On average, 600,000 new jobs created every month since I took office. And in 3 months before I got there, that was one-tenth of what was being created. It's sixty—the 60,000, as opposed to 600,000 jobs a month. In total, the job creation in the first 8 months of my administration is nearly 5 million jobs.</p>, <p>Jobs up, wages up, unemployment down—that's progress. And it's a tribute to the hard work and resilience of the American people who are battling through this pandemic, working to keep their businesses afloat.</p>, <p>Remember, today's report is based on a survey that was taken during the week of September the 13th—not today, September the 13th—when the COVID cases were averaging more than 150,000 per day. Since then, we've seen the daily cases fall by more than one-third, and they're continuing to trend down. We're continuing to make progress.</p>, <p>Right now things in Washington, as you all know—[<i>laughter</i>]—are awfully noisy. Turn on the news and every conversation is a confrontation, every disagreement is a crisis. But when you take a step back and look at what's happening, we're actually making real progress. Maybe it doesn't seem fast enough. I'd like to see it faster, and we're going to make it faster. But maybe it doesn't appear dramatic enough. But I too would like to, as I said, move it faster. We're making consistent, steady progress though.</p>, <p>And thanks to bipartisan agreements, we're making progress on funding the Government and raising the debt limit so people continue to get their Social Security checks, the military continues to get paid, and so much more.</p>, <p>We're making real progress on COVID-19 as well. More than 186 million Americans are now fully vaccinated. More than 75 percent of eligible Americans have gotten at least one shot. And COVID cases are down 40 percent in the past month. Hospitalizations are down over 25 percent.</p>, <p>In July, when I announced the first vaccination requirement, about 95 million eligible Americans still had not been vaccinated. Today, we've reduced that from 95 to 67 million eligible Americans that haven't been vaccinated. That's still much too much. There's more work to do, including getting more people vaccinated, but we continue to make progress. Progress.</p>, <p>And the American Rescue Plan, which we passed shortly after I was elected—we've made progress providing rent and mortgage relief to help keep roofs over people's heads. We've provided checks in pockets and other benefits so families can put food on the table for their families, hundreds of thousands of loans to help small businesses stay open and keep employments—employees on the job getting paid.</p>, <p>Today, towns and cities and States that were at risk of losing hundreds of thousands of jobs before because they didn't have the budget to pay, we helped make their payroll for them so they could keep teachers, police officers, firefighters, essential workers on the job; helping schools stay open with the equipment and resources needed to keep students and educators safe.</p>, <p>And we finally gave a tax break—[<i>laughter</i>]—I've been looking at this for a long time—to families with children, which, as I speak, is providing monthly checks for more than—more families with—for 60 million children: $300 per month for every child under the age of 7, $250 a month for every child under the age of 17. Keeping the tax cut—it's a tax cut for these people—and cutting child poverty nearly in half, over 40 percent.</p>, <p>We're making progress protecting our air and water as well and our natural lands. Much more to do, and I have more—I'll have more to say about that later today.</p>, <p>The jobs numbers also remind us that we have important work ahead of us and important investments we need to make. America is still the largest economy in the world. We still have the most productive workers and the most innovative minds in the world, but we risk losing our edge as a nation if we don't move.</p>, <p>Our infrastructure used to be the best in the world. Today, according to the World Economic Forum, the United States of America ranks 13th in the world—13th—on infrastructure: roads, bridges, ports, et cetera. We were among the first in the world to guarantee access to universal education back at the turn of the 20th century. Now, the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development—catch this—ranks America 35 out of 37 major economies when it comes to investing in early childhood education as a percent of GDP. Thirty-five out of thirty-seven. On all these investments that fuel a strong economy, we've taken our foot off the gas. And the world has taken notice, including our adversaries. And now they're closing the gap.</p>, <p>Look, so it's essential that we have to regain the momentum we've lost. As my wife says all the time—a professor—she says, any country that outeducates us is going to outcompete us. The work of our time is to prepare ourselves for it to be competitive to win the fast-changing 21st-century global economy.</p>, <p>That's why I proposed two critical pieces of legislation being debated here in Washington right now. One focus: on the investments we need to make in the physical infrastructure of America—roads, bridges, ports, et cetera. The second focus: on the investments we need to make in the American people to make us more competitive.</p>, <p>I know this is my legislation, and I feel strongly about it, but the people who have the most at stake are the American people. So we need to stay focused on what these bills will mean to the people who are just looking for a little bit of breathing room, a fair chance to build a decent, middle class life to succeed and thrive instead of just hanging on by their fingernails. We need to keep an eye—an eye on what's fundamentally at stake for our country: the ability to compete and win the race of the 21st century, as we did the 20th century, a race that other countries are doing everything they can to win.</p>, <p>In recent years, China has spent around three times as much on infrastructure—three times as much—as a share of its economy than the United States has. Our infrastructure bill makes investments we need to rebuild the arteries of our economy: the roads, the highways, the bridges, the ports, the airports, the rails. And we're going to allow us to replace lead water pipes, which are poisoning our children and families—it's ridiculous; build a modern energy grid that can withstand storms and carry new renewable energy across America; make high-speed internet affordable and available to everywhere in America and create good union jobs in the process of putting that together. We're going to make the largest investment of public transit in American history. And we're going to make the most important investments on our rail since the creation of Amtrak 50 years ago.</p>, <p>But it isn't enough just to invest in our physical infrastructure. We're going to lead the world like we used to. If we're going to do that, we also have to invest in our people. That's what my second bill does, the Build Back Better plan. That's what it does.</p>, <p>Today, only about half of the 3- and 4-year-olds in America are enrolled in early child education—early childhood education. In Germany, France, the U.K., Latvia, that number is more than 90 percent. We're falling behind.</p>, <p>It's not just early education. According to one study, America ranks—catch this—America ranks 33d out of the 44 advanced economies when it comes to the percentage of our young people who have attained a post-high school degree. The United States, 33d out of 44?</p>, <p>My Build Back plan—Build Back Better plan gets us back on track to making 4 additionals of—years of public education available for every person in America: 2 years of high-quality preschool on the front end, which indicates that over 56 percent of the children will be able to go through all 12 years and beyond without any interruption; and investments in community college so our students can gain the skills they need and carve out a piece—a place for themselves in the 21st-century economy.</p>, <p>We're going to help build families, and we're going to help them afford to care for their new baby, a child, an elderly relative. It's going to extend the tax credit for families with children. It's going to help us meet the moment on climate change and become a global leader in the fast-growing clean energy industries, like solar and wind power.</p>, <p>The whole world knows that the future of the auto industry is electric—electric—and battery technology. We need to make sure America builds that future instead of falling behind. We should build those vehicles and the batteries that go into them and the charging stations they're going to need, the 500,000 we're going to build across America. Here, in the United States, we should be doing this. And look, if we get this done, we're going to breathe new life into our economy and our workforce, and we're going to breathe cleaner air at the same time.</p>, <p>These are the kinds of investments that will get America back in the game and give our workers a chance—a fighting chance. Economists left, right, and center agree. Earlier this year, Moody's and Wall Street projected that the investments in these bills will bring us a higher GDP, an additional 2 million jobs per year, and lower unemployment.</p>, <p>These bills are not about left versus right, or modern [moderate]* versus progressive, or anything else that pits Americans against one another. These bills are about competitiveness versus complacency—competitiveness versus complacency—opportunity versus decay. They're about leading the world or whether we're going to let the world pass us by.</p>, <p>The American people understand what's at stake here. They understand that when workers and families have a better shot, America has a better shot. Given half a chance, the American people have never, never, ever, ever let their country down.</p>, <p>Today we received more evidence of the progress we're making. And I know we can make a lot more in the days ahead.</p>, <p>I want to thank you. And God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you very much.</p>]"
7,1,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts in Elk Grove Village, Illinois",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-covid-19-response-and-national-vaccination-efforts-elk-grove-village-illinois,"[<p>Jerry, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>, <p>Mr. Mayor, thanks for the passport into town. [<i>Laughter</i>] I tell you, every time I come to the Greater Chicago Area, there's somebody I want to steal and bring back to Washington, Gov. I've done it a couple times, you know. [<i>Laughter</i>] At any rate—look, Jerry, every company needs people like you—every single one—someone who knows what my dad taught me. And a lot of people who know me well, including the Governor's sister, who I worked closely with for 8 years—my dad used to have an expression. He used to say: ""Everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity. And, Joey, a job is a hell of a lot more than about a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about your place in the community. It about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, everything is going to be okay.'""</p>, <p>That's the God's truth. He'd say that every—ever since he lost—things went south in Scranton, Pennsylvania, when I was a kid and coal was shut down. My dad was not a coalminer. I had a great-grandfather who was a coal miner engineer. But you know, he was a salesperson. Everything—we moved down to Wilmington, Delaware, a little town called Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town. Well, there's no steel anymore, but right on the border of Pennsylvania. And it was always about the dignity of work.</p>, <p>And what you've been doing here about this pandemic is about protecting the dignity—the dignity of your fellow Americans. You know, you stayed in an operations mode, lining up protective equipment for the rest of the country, all around the country. And when the vaccine came out, you all stepped up, and you got the shots. And as a company, you're getting more shots in arms.</p>, <p>And I want to thank Otto for hosting us here at Clayco, one of the Midwest's biggest construction companies, $3 billion a year in revenue. Thousands of employees nationwide and here in Elk Grove, 100 percent union. Not labor. Union. Union.</p>, <p>One of the reasons I said I ran was to rebuild this country and rebuild the backbone of the country, and I meant it sincerely. And the backbone is to build from the bottom up and the middle out.</p>, <p>I'm a capitalist. I think people should be able to go out and make a lot of money. That's not the problem. But everybody should have an even shot.</p>, <p>And who built the middle class? Unions built the middle class. Without the—not a joke—without the unions, we would not have a middle class in America. So everybody owes you all.</p>, <p>You know, you're constructing buildings for some of America's biggest companies, but you're also doing something bigger than that: You're helping us beat back COVID-19. So are the great leaders who are here today.</p>, <p>J.B., you—Governor, you've done more than about anybody I can think of in any State. I mean that sincerely. You've stepped up. You've always done what you said you were going to do. And you've been relentless in getting people vaccinated. In the Midwest, you're leading. You're leading. And it's real; it's not hyperbole.</p>, <p>And Mayor Lightfoot—who I said, ""Please go back to work. I'm going to get in trouble."" She had to leave. But Mayor Lightfoot, the same thing. And, Elk Grove Mayor Johnson, you've done a hell of a job as well.</p>, <p>You know, we have 11 Members of Congress here. Raja, thank you for hosting this in your district, for permission to come into the district. And I also want to thank colleagues in the House of Representatives: Mike Quigley; Robin Kelly; Bobby Rush; Danny Davis; Jan Schakowsky, an old friend; Bill Foster; Brad Schneider; Sean Casten; Lauren Underwood; and Marie Newman.</p>, <p>And I know—look, for them, you don't quite under-—you all understand it in a different context, but this a busman's holiday for them, to have to come hear another politician speak. [<i>Laughter</i>] You know what I mean? [<i>Laughter</i>] Not a joke, folks. [<i>Laughter</i>] I appreciate it. I genuinely appreciate it. I appreciate it.</p>, <p>And I know they wanted to be here, but there's others who are in Washington and can't be here. Dick Durbin and Tammy, who I've both spoken to, they're in Washington and, hopefully—hopefully—will be voting soon.</p>, <p>And also, we've got State leadership here. Lieutenant Governor Juliana is here—Stratton. And —the Ohio-Pennsylvania—I'm from Pennsylvania. The Illinois President, of the—Don Harmon; State Senator Laura Murphy; State Rep. Martin Moylan.</p>, <p>And we've got great labor leaders here too. Tim—where's Tim? There you go, Tim. Thank you. Thank you, pal. AFL-CIO State president. And Jeff Isaacson, United Brotherhood of Carpenters. And Don Finn, IBEW. And Robert Rieter—Reiter—R-E-I-T-E-R—Reiter—of the Chicago Federation of Labor.</p>, <p>And, folks, that's how we beat COVID-19: by working together.</p>, <p>We have an expression in that little town of Claymont I was from: ""You all brung me to the dance."" Labor, you're the—you're the reason I'm standing here. Not a joke. Not a joke. I got elected when I was 29 years old to the United States Senate, 17 days before I was eligible to be sworn in. I had to wait around to be sworn in, not a joke as well. And I won by 3,300 votes. And labor—labor, including the police unions as well as the firefighters, stood up and endorsed me.</p>, <p>And because—I kid with the Governor. I said: ""I grew up in a town called Claymont, Delaware. From third grade on, I went to a little Catholic school called Holy Rosary. And across the street from Holy Rosary was a—was the fire station. And the guys I grew up with, you became either a firefighter, a cop, or a priest. I wasn't qualified for any of them, so I had to be President."" And so—[<i>laughter</i>].</p>, <p>But look, it's been a month since I laid out a six-part plan to accelerate the path out of this pandemic: One, vaccinate the unvaccinated. Two, continue to keep the vaccinated protected. Keep children safe and schools open, which the Gov is doing. Increase testing and masking. Protect the economic recovery. And improve the care of the people with COVID-19.</p>, <p>We've made real progress across the board. More than 185 million Americans are now fully vaccinated. More than 75 percent of eligible Americans have gotten at least one shot.</p>, <p>We've made great progress on equity as well, and closing gaps in racial—the gaps in race, as well as ethnic vaccination rates. Recent data shows that Latino Americans, Black Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans have now gotten vaccinated about the comparable rate as White Americans. That's not happened before. And our work on equity isn't done, but it's an important piece of progress.</p>, <p>We're also starting to see less than 19—less COVID-19 cases in a vast majority of communities around the country. Cases are down, this past month, by 40 percent. Hospitalizations are down by 25 percent. We're headed in the right direction if we don't—if we keep our eye on the ball here. We still have a long way to go.</p>, <p>The fact is, this has been a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Unvaccinated. The unvaccinated overcrowd our hospitals, overrunning emergency rooms and intensive care units. The unvaccinated patients are leaving no room for someone with a heart attack or in need of a cancer operation and so much more because they can't into the ICU. They can't get into the operating rooms.</p>, <p>The unvaccinated also put our economy at risk because people are reluctant to go out. And think about this: Even in places where there is no restriction on going to restaurants and gyms and movie theaters, people are not going—in anywhere near the numbers—because they're worried they're going to get sick.</p>, <p>I've tried everything in my power to get people vaccinated. First thing I did when I was sworn into office back on January 20 is, I bought enough vaccine—right off the bat—to vaccinate every single American. There were only 4 million Americans who had been vaccinated up to that point, even though the virus had been around.</p>, <p>Second, we made everyone eligible to get a vaccination and made it easy and convenient for them to find a place to get vaccinated, over eight hundred—80,000 places around the country.</p>, <p>Third, we gave everyone ample time and information to deal with their concerns. We developed hundreds of million—we'd—millions of dollars in incentives—you did here in the city and the State of Illinois—and cities and community organizations to encourage vaccinations. Governor Pritzker, you've done one hell of a job, in terms of encouraging people before we even get to the mandate.</p>, <p>But even after all those efforts, we still had more than a quarter of people in the United States who were eligible for vaccinations, but didn't get the shot. And we know there is no other way to beat the pandemic than to get the vast majority of Americans vaccinated. It's as simple as that. And to spread to our children, to spread throughout society and at our hospitals, the risk of other variants, it's all dangerous and obvious, but we're still not there.</p>, <p>We have to beat this thing. So, while I didn't race to do it right away, that's why I've had to move toward requirements that everyone get vaccinated or I had the authority to do that. That wasn't my first instinct.</p>, <p>My administration is now requiring Federal workers to be vaccinated. We've also required Federal contractors to be vaccinated. If you have a contract with the Federal Government, working for the Federal Government, you have to be vaccinated.</p>, <p>We're requiring Active Duty military to be vaccinated. We're making sure health care workers are vaccinated, because if you seek care at a health care facility, you should have the certainty that the people providing that care are protected from COVID and cannot spread it to you.</p>, <p>The Labor Department is going to shortly issue an emergency rule—which I asked for several weeks ago, and they're going through the process—to require all employees [employers]* with more than 100 people, whether they work for the Federal Government or not—this is within a—in the purview of the Labor Department—to ensure their workers are fully vaccinated or face testing at least once a week.</p>, <p>In total, this Labor Department vaccination requirement will cover 100 million Americans, about two-thirds of all the people who work in America. And here's the deal: These requirements are already proving that they work.</p>, <p>Starting in July, when I announced the first vaccination requirement for the Federal Government, about 95 million eligible Americans were unvaccinated. This was mentioned a little bit earlier. Today, we've reduced that number to 67 [million]* eligible Americans who aren't vaccinated. And today we released a new report outlining effective vaccination requirements that are already proving their worth.</p>, <p>This report shows three key things. First, vaccination requirements result in more people getting vaccinated. In the past few weeks, as more and more organizations have implemented their own requirements, they have seen their vaccination rates rise dramatically.</p>, <p>For example, the Department of Defense has gone from 67 [76]* percent of Active Duty forces being vaccinated to 97 percent as of tomorrow. Vaccination just 6 weeks into this vaccination requirement—that's how quickly it's moved.</p>, <p>We're also seeing this at colleges and universities across the country. More than 95 percent of students at colleges and universities, like Northwestern and University of Illinois-Chicago, are vaccinated.</p>, <p>And we're going to see it health systems around the country as well. Rush University Medical Center, here in Chicago, has gone from 72 percent to more than 95 percent of its employees fully vaccinated under its requirements.</p>, <p>These requirements work. And as the Business Roundtable and others told me when I announced the first requirement, that encouraged businesses to feel they could come in and demand the same thing of their employees. More people are getting vaccinated. More lives are being saved.</p>, <p>Let's be clear: When you see headlines and reports of ""mass firings"" and ""hundreds"" of people losing their jobs, look at the bigger story. I've spoken with Scott Kirby, the CEO of United Airlines, who's here today. United went from 59 percent of their employees to 99 percent of their employees in less than 2 months after implementing the requirement. Ninety-nine percent.</p>, <p>And by the way, Scott, I want you to know I've instructed the Justice Department to make sure that we deal with the violence on aircraft coming from those people who are taking issues. We're going to deal with that.</p>, <p>In the last days of their implementation, they cut the remaining number of employees left to get vaccinated in half. They went from 67,000 United employees to sixty-six—of 67,000, 66,800 complied. People chose to get vaccinated. That's why we're seeing more companies signing up.</p>, <p>I recently met with the CEOs of Disney, Microsoft—who you're familiar with here—Walgreens to hear about their requirements. The Business Roundtable represents 200 of the largest businesses in the world and has championed vaccination requirements to keep businesses open and workers safe.</p>, <p>America's largest aerospace companies—Lockheed Martin; Raytheon, who I met with yesterday, the chairman of the board; Northrop Grumman—they all just announced plans to implement vaccination requirements.</p>, <p>Even—this I always get a kick out of—Fox News. [<i>Laughter</i>] Fox News requires vaccinations for all employees. Give me a break. Fox News. And, over the past week, we've seen American, Southwest, Alaska, and Jet Blue Airlines all announce requirements.</p>, <p>The leaders in Chicago are stepping up. As I've said, the mayor of—Mayor Lightfoot, Governor Pritzker are requiring vaccinations for State and city workers, health care workers, and teachers. The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce here, Jack Lavin, who's here, has called for all members of his—of the chamber to require vaccinations for their employees going back to work in person.</p>, <p>And I came here to Clayco to thank this company for doing the right thing. Today Clayco is announcing it's going to require all employees to be fully vaccinated or test once a week. It matters. I know these decisions aren't easy, but you're setting an example and a powerful example.</p>, <p>The second thing I'd like to say: Today's report shows that vaccination requirements are good for the economy, not only increasing vaccination rates, but to help send people back to work. Back to work.</p>, <p>You know, when I first started the vaccination program, and we got all that vaccine, enough for everyone—we're vaccinating 3 million people a day—we were getting very close before things began to slow down—the economy is growing in leaps and bounds: 6 percent—the fastest growing major economy in the world.</p>, <p>In fact, increased vaccination coverage results in as many as 5 million American workers going back to work; because they feel safe, they can go back to work. There will be more economic demand to drive people back to the workforce.</p>, <p>But don't take it from me. Not from some, you know, liberal think tank this comes from. But here's what Wall Street is saying. Goldman Sachs, quote: ""Vaccinations will have a positive impact on employment."" It means less spread of COVID-19, which will help people return to work. Moody's on Wall Street: ""Vaccination means fewer infections, hospitalizations, and death. In turn, it means a stronger economy.""</p>, <p>One economist called vaccine requirements, and I quote, ""the single most powerful""—he didn't say ""single""—""the most powerful economic stimulus ever enacted."" End of quote.</p>, <p>The third point I'd like to make: The report shows that vaccination requirements have broad public support. Yes, some object, and some object very strenuously. And some are making a political statement out of this issue. But a strong bipartisan majority of Americans support vaccinations. They know it isn't about politics; it's about life and death. That's what it's about. It's about looking out for one another. It's about being patriotic, doing the right thing.</p>, <p>Folks, vaccination requirements work, and there's nothing new about them. They've been around for decades. We've been living with these requirements throughout our lives. Students, health care professionals, and our troops have been required to receive vaccinations for everything from polio to measles, to mumps, to rubella.</p>, <p>And the reason most people in America don't worry about polio, measles, mumps, rubella is because they've been vaccinated. I don't quite get this, you know, why it's a matter of—no violation of your right to be able to go to school or get a job, to have—et cetera. But now it's a great <i>cause célèbre</i>?</p>, <p>So today I'm calling on more employers to act. My message is: Require your employees to get vaccinated. With vaccinations, we're going to beat this pandemic finally. Without them, we face endless months of chaos in our hospitals, damage to our economy, and anxiety in our schools, and empty restaurants, and much less commerce.</p>, <p>Look, I know that vaccination requirements are a tough medicine—unpopular with some, politics for others—but they're lifesaving. They're game changing for our country. We're in a position to leap forward in a way that we haven't for a long, long time economically. Businesses have more power than ever before to change the arc of this pandemic and save lives and protect and grow our economy.</p>, <p>So, as President, I'm going to continue to do everything I can to get us out of this pandemic. I look forward to more businesses joining that effort.</p>, <p>And for folks who haven't gotten vaccinated, get it done. Do the right thing. It can save your life. It can save the lives of those around you.</p>, <p>You know, if I can digress for just a second: Last night I was on the television—on television—I was on the telephone with a person at an emergency hospital ward in Pennsylvania, because a good friend had called, and he had rushed his significant other to the emergency room because this woman was having trouble breathing, had a high fever, and could not really catch her breath. And they got her into the hospital, but the waiting room was so crowded, things were so backed up, they couldn't even get her to be seen initially.</p>, <p>So, because I knew this person, I called. I called the desk and the receiving nurse, and asked what the situation was and has anyone even—and by the way, I wasn't complaining because they're getting the living hell kicked out of them, by the way. Doctors and nurses, some of them are just—they're running dry. I really mean it. They're getting the living hell kicked out of them and sometimes physically. And to make a long story short, it took a while because all of the—not all—the vast majority of the emergency rooms and the docs were occupied taking care of COVID patients.</p>, <p>I'll bet every one of you can name somebody who got sent to the hospital with something other than COVID and couldn't get it taken care of. How many people do you know—I know—who've had to put off elective surgery—surgery they need done—but they couldn't get a hospital room? It didn't mean they were going to die, in many cases, but some places in the world, that's happening. You can't even get to the—do the elective surgery that's necessary, particularly for a lot of cancer patients.</p>, <p>So look, things are changing, and we can end this. We can end this thing. It's easy, it's accessible, and it's free to get the vaccine.</p>, <p>Text your ZIP Code to 438829—438829. Text your ZIP Code there or visit vaccines.gov to find a vaccination location near you. I promise there's one within 5 minutes of where you—15 minutes from where you are. And it's free.</p>, <p>Let me close with this: We have a plan. We have the tools. We're using them, and we're making progress. We just have to finish the job. Finish the job. So, for God's sake, for your own sake, for the sake of your families: Get vaccinated. We can do this. We can do this if we do it together. And we can literally change the circumstances, the health, the camaraderie, the employment, and the access to a growing economy, if we step up and lead the world.</p>, <p>And one last thing I'd like to mention, which is not directly—it's not part of what I was going to say today. But I've made a commitment that—just like World War II, we were the arsenal of democracy, providing the means by which the Allies could fight and win the war—we're the arsenal of vaccines.</p>, <p>I've not only purchased enough vaccine to make sure every single American can get a vaccine shot, get the full dose and a booster, but provided for—already we've put out a million-eight-hundred-thousand [180 million]* doses of vaccines to other parts of the world. And we're going to end up doing over a billion-two-hundred-million doses between now and the end of the first quarter of next year.</p>, <p>Because, you know, it's not just being decent and honorable about what we can do, but it's in our own naked interest. If we haven't learned before, you can't build a wall high enough to keep out—you can't—a virus. You can't do it. You cannot do it.</p>, <p>So we have an obligation in our own naked self-interest to help other countries. And by the way, I travel the world. I've met with all the major world leaders, and I'm going to continue to meet with them. And guess what? Other countries are making like they're really doing a great deal. We have provided more vaccines around the world than every other country in the world combined. Combined.</p>, <p>And guess what? Unlike China and Russia and others, we're not asking a single thing. Not a single thing in return. Nothing. Nothing. And it's having a profound impact on how we're viewed.</p>, <p>So, those of you who haven't gotten vaccinated who may be listening to this broadcast, please get vaccinated. Please.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you so very much. Thank you.</p>]"
7,2,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the Public Debt Limit,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-public-debt-limit,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Hello, folks. Please. I want to thank——</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President removed his mask.</i>]</p>, <p>You can take these off while we're speaking. I want to thank our participants that are here, as well as those who are on Zoom. And this is, to state the obvious, an important get-together here.</p>, <p>And I'm going to make some brief comments, maybe ask a few questions. And then we'll yield and go down the road here, and maybe we can—all of us, both virtually as well as in person here—we can, hopefully, make some progress.</p>, <p>I want to thank the Secretary of Treasury, Secretary Yellen; Commerce Secretary Raimondo—I see her on the screen there—it's good to see you; and the leaders of some of America's most important businesses and institutions, the American Association of Retired Persons—the AARP—Bank of America, Citibank, Deloitte, Intel, JP Morgan, Nasdaq, the National Association of Realtors, and Raytheon, and—for joining me today to talk about the need to raise the debt limit.</p>, <p>We haven't failed to do that since our inception as a country. We need to act. These leaders know the need to act. The United States pays its bill. It's who we are. It's who we've been. It's who we're going to continue to be, God willing. That's what's called the ""full faith and credit of the United States.""</p>, <p>Let's be clear: Raising the debt limit is paying our old debts. It has nothing to do with new spending or what may be coming this year or other years. It has nothing to do with my plans on infrastructure or building back better, both of which are paid for, but they're not even in the queue right now. It's about paying for what we owe and preventing a catastrophic event occurring in our economy.</p>, <p>I'm glad these leaders are here to talk about the real-world impact this is going to have on people and on our position in the world. Today's discussion won't be partisan. It shouldn't be. Raising the debt limit is usually bipartisan.</p>, <p>Let me speak for myself here: I want to be clear so the American people understand what's going on. There's a Senate vote today to raise the debt limit. Traditionally, it needs only 50 votes. I was—we were informed by our Republican friends that they had to be all Democrat votes; they weren't going to help. I said, ""Okay, we'll provide 50 votes.""</p>, <p>The definition—and the Democrats, we have the votes. The Democrats are willing to step up and stop this economic catastrophe if Senate Republicans will just get out of the way. But our Senate Republicans friends are planning to block the vote to raise the debt limit by using a—the procedural power called the ""filibuster."" To say that in plain English, it means you have to have 60 votes when there's a filibuster. Sixty votes—a supermajority—instead of fifty to get anything done. It's not right, and it's dangerous.</p>, <p>The reason we have to raise the debt limit is, in part, because of the policies of the previous administration, which incurred nearly $8 trillion in bills in 4 years—some of which Democrats voted for—more than a quarter of all the debt now outstanding. We had to raise the debt limit three times when Donald Trump was President. And the Republicans moved to raise it each time, and each time, the Democrats supported the effort to raise the debt.</p>, <p>But now Republicans won't raise the debt limit despite being responsible for what the debt limit—why it has to be raised for the bills that are outstanding. They won't raise it enough through—if they don't, we're going to be defaulting on the debt that would lead to self-inflicted wounds that risk the market tanking and wiping out retirement savings and costing jobs.</p>, <p>Defaulting on the debt, which Secretary Yellen said could happen at any day after October the 18th—that's when we run out of money—means that Social Security benefits will stop, salaries to servicemembers will stop, benefits to veterans will stop, and much more.</p>, <p>The failure to raise the debt limit will undermine the safety of the United States Treasury securities; threaten the reserve status of the dollar as the world currency and the—that the world relies on; downgrade America's credit rating; and result in a rise in interest rates for families, talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards.</p>, <p>My friends—and they are many of my friends—the Senate Republicans' position I find to be not only hypocritical, but dangerous and a bit disgraceful, especially as we're crawling our way out of a pandemic that cost America 700,000 lives thus far, and we're still battling it. Our markets are rattled. America's savings are on the line. The American people—your savings, your pocketbook—are directly impacted by this stunt. It doesn't have to be this way.</p>, <p>My Republican friends need to stop playing Russian roulette with the U.S. economy. If they don't want to do the job, just get out of the way. We'll take the heat. We'll do it. We will do it. Let us do it. Let the Democrats vote to raise the debt limit without obstruction or any further delays.</p>, <p>House Democrats have already passed the bill that would do that: raise the debt limit and keep the Government functioning. It's sitting in the United States Senate right now, where Democrats, with no help from Republicans, have the votes today to pass the debt limit.</p>, <p>The path Republicans offer would take us right to the brink and cause irreparable economic damage, in my view. So let's vote and end this mess today. That's the only way to eliminate the uncertainty and risk that will remain for American families and our economy if we don't.</p>, <p>Over more than 200 years, America has built this hard-earned reputation of the strongest, safest, and most secure investment in the world. And that's why the United States is the financial rock the world looks to and trusts.</p>, <p>Now, in one cynical, destructive, partisan ploy—just for politics—our Republican friends are teetering on the brink here. They're threatening to boot that all away. Now it's a meteor headed to crash into our economy. We should all want to stop it, stop it immediately. This shouldn't be partisan.</p>, <p>And I'm thankful for the leaders who share the urgency on why we need to act—and we act—need to act now. Many of them are here with me. Not next week, now.</p>, <p>I look forward to hearing from the—their perspectives and—and we'll now get the—get this meeting started, with my colleague's permission.</p>, <p>I'd like to start off, if I may, with a question for Jane Fraser, the CEO of Citi. And by the way, congratulations on your award. You run one of the largest banks in America. And what impacts are you seeing or do you think you'll see from this obstruction? What does it mean for the small businesses and everyday people if we renege on the debt here?</p>, <p><i>Citi Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser.</i> Thank you, Mr. President, for inviting us all to talk about this critical issue. As the head of the bank, I don't have insight on what the right legislative solution is, but I can tell you that, from an economic perspective, we need to resolve this issue very quickly.</p>, <p>[<i>Ms. Fraser continued her remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>So we really urge the administration and Congress to do what's necessary to resolve the situation for the good of our economy, for the good of our country.</p>, <p>Thank you, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, thank you. And you make a very good point that we're—God willing, I think we're just about to begin to turn the corner again on the pandemic. And an awful lot of small businesses—tens of thousands of them—have acquired significant debt. We've provided significant relief as well, but it's just an incredibly complicated feature.</p>, <p>I'd like now, with her permission—I'd like to ask Adena Friedman, the CEO of NASDAQ, whether she'd be willing to give us her thoughts. And thank you for taking the time, Ms. Friedman, to talk to us.</p>, <p><i>Nasdaq President and Chief Executive Officer Adena T. Friedman.</i> Well, Mr. President, thank you very much for the opportunity to address the current situation.</p>, <p>We are starting to experience elevated volatility in the markets, which can be partially attributed to the uncertainty that's been introduced by the delay in approving the extension of the debt limit. We would expect that a continued delay in extending the debt limit would further destabilize the markets.</p>, <p>And when we consider the broader economic costs of the uncertainty and certainly of possible default, we would, as Jane mentioned, see higher borrowing costs for consumers and small businesses, as well as delays in much-needed payments to major social programs, such as Social Security and Medicare. So, when we look at this, these delays and certainly a default would mean that hard-working Americans will ultimately bear the burden.</p>, <p>So, as you mentioned, the—extending the debt limit simply allows the payment of obligations that have already been made by the U.S. Government. Therefore, voting to extend the debt limit is an important bipartisan action to reinforce the full faith and credit of the United States. And we urge the—we urge action as quickly as possible.</p>, <p>So thank you.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Let me ask you the DEFCON 10 question: If we don't—if we default, even for a day or two, what do you think the impact on the market will be?</p>, <p><i>Ms. Friedman.</i> I think that we would expect that—and investors really just don't handle uncertainty well. And I think that investors and—and certainly, as we know, there are hundreds of millions of investors that are involved in the markets today that have put their hard-working—their hard-earned savings into the markets, and we would expect that the markets will react very, very negatively if we actually get to a point of a DEFCON 10 type of situation with a default.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> What does that do to people's retirement accounts?</p>, <p><i>Ms. Friedman.</i> Yes, I think we have to realize that well over half of the adult Americans have money in the stock market, either directly or indirectly. And so those savings accounts, those retirement accounts, the pensions, they'll all experience a significant, sharp drop in their values, which of course makes them feel less certain about their ability to manage their lives and their savings and plan for retirement.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, thank you. [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't mean to thank you for the result, but thank you—[<i>laughter</i>]—for explaining to people who are watching this how consequential this is.</p>, <p>You know, I see my old buddy Jamie Dimon up there at JP Morgan. Jamie—excuse me for calling you Jaime—Mr. CEO, it's good to see you.</p>, <p>Why, from your perspective, do we need to raise the debt limit immediately, before October 18th?</p>, <p><i>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon.</i> Mr. President, thank you. You can call me Jamie. That's fine.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> You can call me Joe. It's fine.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Dimon.</i> And I appreciate you having us all here. Mr. President.</p>, <p>Anyway, there are five quick points I want to make. Number one is really a morality point: We all teach our children that we're supposed to meet our obligations. I don't think the Nation should be any different.</p>, <p>[<i>Mr. Dimon continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>And number five, America's role in the world is essential. We are the bedrock—the American treasury is the bedrock. Our credibility, it—we're being watched right now by our allies and, unfortunately, our enemies. Our credibility is absolutely essential. Trust in America and the U.S. dollar and the financial system is critical to the world economy and eventually, actually, world peace.</p>, <p>So this is a time I think we should show American competence, not American incompetence.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I'm glad you raised that last point, because when I got back from the G-7, and subsequently with a number of virtual meetings with my colleagues and heads of state—I know Brian Moynihan knows about this as well—we are not only being measured in terms of our strength and our reliability, based upon the size of our military and/or the physical strength that we possess, but it's on whether or not we can function.</p>, <p>There's a great debate going on—and I'm not exaggerating this; all of you deal internationally. There's a great debate going on, on whether or not, in the 21st century—in the second quarter of the 21st century—can democracies function with things moving so rapidly?</p>, <p>And I can tell you a couple of the folks I've had a lot of—spent a lot of time with of late—Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi Jinping—they really believe that autocracies are the only way forward, because they can act quickly and decisively. It's not a joke. And we're seeing the effects of this around the world.</p>, <p>And I don't know—it's—I don't know—it's understandable why the average American wouldn't understand what the consequences of this will be for American security and the willingness of other countries to follow our lead.</p>, <p>We have always led the world not just by the example of our power, but the power of our example. And that's going to be called into severe question. I mean, for real. For real. And it has consequences that are real.</p>, <p>What does—you know, Jamie, what does ""further delay"" mean for a company like yours and the family you serve, if we just—even if we just go on right up to the brink?</p>, <p><i>Mr. Dimon.</i> When we start on Monday, we're going to start reviewing all our contracts, repo, collateral requirements. There will be huge demands of people selling treasuries, wanting financing to treasuries. Interest rates will start going up. It will get worse as we get close to the brink. And as you said, it'll hurt not big companies—and we won't—don't worry about that; we do worry about that it hurts the average American, and we don't want that.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I thank you. We're going to get to everybody, but I'm going to yield to the Director of the Office of Public Engagement, former chairman of the Black Caucus in Congress, Cedric Richmond. Cedric.</p>, <p><i>White House Director of Public Engagement Cedric L. Richmond.</i> Thank you, Mr. President. I'll just quickly yield to who—your great Treasury Secretary, who is an expert on this, for comments on what she thinks the ramifications are and where we're headed.</p>, <p>So, with that, Secretary Yellen.</p>, <p><i>Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen.</i> Thank you, Cedric. Thank you, Mr. President. And let me thank the business and community leaders who have joined us here today. I wish we could be meeting to discuss another topic: finding solutions to climate change or how to better invest in the future of our economy. But the urgency of the debt limit situation demands immediate attention. And I want to be clear about my position.</p>, <p>[<i>Secretary Yellen continued her remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>Ultimately, these benefits have helped us lead in the world economy and become a more prosperous Nation. And yet, today, we are staring into a catastrophe in which we surrender this hard-earned reputation and force the American people and American industry to accept all the pain, the turmoil, and the hardship that comes with default.</p>, <p>It's unnecessary, and it must be avoided at all costs. Congress must address the debt limit immediately.</p>, <p>Thanks. And I look forward to continued conversation.</p>]"

When you read those signs, what do you—what do you think? What comes across your mind?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I smile. I give them a little thumbs up.</p>, <p><i>Budget Reconciliation Process/The President's Legislative Agenda </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>How are you going to trim a trillion or more dollars from this package? What's going to have to go?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, that's what we're negotiating now. And it will be done.</p>, <p>Look, my objective is to get everything that I campaigned on passed eventually. It won't all happen at once. And so we'll get a compromise between the folks who are supporting strongly the infrastructure and the human infrastructure. We'll get a compromise. But it doesn't mean that's the end of what's in the rest of the package.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Is means testing part of that, Mr. President?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Pardon me?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Is means testing part of that, Mr. President?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Sure. Some of it will be means tested, I'm sure. Some of will be means tested.</p>, <p><i>Budget Reconciliation Process </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>What about the Hyde Amendment, Mr. President? Joe Manchin has been pretty strong about where he stands on that. You guys have different views.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I think that's something that's going to have to be decided based on the whole package.</p>, <p><i>The President's Meeting With Democratic Members of Congress/The President's Legislative Agenda </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, your meeting with moderates earlier—how was your meeting with moderates?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]—what?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Do you think that they're on the same page as Senator Manchin when it comes to the overall price tag?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I think they're on the same page as I am. And I'm not being facetious when I say that.</p>, <p>The—you mean the group I met with this morning?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. No, I think they're on the same—they all said they're on the same page.</p>, <p>The question is, look, every major fundamental shift that has taken place in the American economy has seldom ever come with one single piece of legislation at the beginning.</p>, <p>For example—you've heard me say this before, but it's relevant—when Roosevelt passed Social Security, it didn't bear any resemblance to what it is now. And so the idea that we're going to—everything that is—gets passed is going to be the totality of what it's going to end up being remains to be seen.</p>, <p>And my message this morning was: Look, it's very important to establish the principle: the principle that is contained in the amendment, such as childcare, the child tax credit. Well, it may be that the child tax credit gets altered in terms of amount. But once it's put in place, even though it's only for several years, it gets harder and harder to take it out. And that's my point to people. We don't have to get everything all at once.</p>, <p><i>Public Debt Limit/Budget Reconciliation Process </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, if McConnell—if Senate Minority Leader McConnell refuses to cooperate, should Senate Democrats do this by reconciliation? What happens next?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, quite frankly, there's not many options. If they're going to be that irresponsible, there's not many options. There's not much time left to do it by reconciliation.</p>, <p>They can keep it on two tranches. They can keep us on the floor for hundreds of amendments. They can just delay this.</p>, <p>I don't think they're going to end up being that irresponsible. I can't believe it.</p>, <p>But thank you.</p>, <p><i>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H.

In Fed Chair Powell?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Do you still have confidence in him? And do you——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thus far, yes. But I'm just catching up on some of these assertions you make.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Are you going to renominate him?</p>, <p><i>Budget Reconciliation Process </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, how did you persuade Senator Manchin to come up a little?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, we've had many, many talks. And what I've asked Senator Manchin, as well as Senator Sinema, to do is decide what it is they like in the Build Back Better and then move from there. And if they like it, the particular provisions, like, for example—I'm not going to give away what either one of them said, but one of them said they very much like the child tax credit, but they'd like to see it phase out sooner than later.</p>, <p>I said: ""Well, come up with a number. Come up with what you're for."" And when they added up—each of them added up all that they think they like, it got them a higher number.

7,4,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Education and Family Assistance Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters in Howell, Michigan",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-and-education-and-family-assistance,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Hello, Michigan! It's good to be back. It really is. And, John, thank you for that introduction.</p>, <p>The truth of the matter is, there's a reason why the American labor movement across the board has the single best workers in the world: because you're the best trained. I wish the American people understood how much serious, serious training goes into being a union worker. I really mean it. You're the best in the world.</p>, <p>I was kidding—someone said to me earlier that—I said I'm a union President; I'm a union—a President who supports unions—not labor, unions. And someone pointed out to me that I allegedly have the—used the word ""union"" as President more than the last seven Presidents combined. You built the country. No, not a joke. You built the country.</p>, <p>And it's great to be here with several excellent Members of Congress. Elissa Slotkin—Elissa, you—you don't want to screw around with her. [<i>Laughter</i>] She's an intelligence officer as well, so she's forgotten more than most of you know. But thanks for riding out with me, and thanks for the advice you've given me—and I mean that sincerely—and how we're going to make sure that everything we do here is paid for—paid for—and not a single penny raised in taxes of anybody making under 400 grand.</p>, <p>And, Debbie, you're the best in the world. You and John have been so—friends of mine—you've been for so, so long. You've stepped in and taken over in a way that I think is—had to be both emotionally difficult, but you've done an incredible job. And I consider you one of my great friends. Thank you.</p>, <p>And, Dan, I—you're okay, Dan. [<i>Laughter</i>] You ain't quite like the woman sitting next to you. But all kidding aside—[<i>laughter</i>]—Dan, you've done a great—I mean, I really mean it: You're always there for everything that's important to your constituents. And you understand what I'm going to talk about little bit later: The way we built this country is from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. And you get it.</p>, <p>And, Andy, as my dad would say, you've got good blood, kid. [<i>Laughter</i>] And thank you for what you're doing. Thank you for stepping in. And thank you for the great job you do.</p>, <p>Michigan, I also have—it's also fortunate to have an outstanding—United States Senators, who are doing what they're supposed to do. They're in Washington because the Senate is in. Debbie and Gary are in Washington now and—to cast some really important votes to keep things moving.</p>, <p>And of course, it's great to be here with my friend—we've become friends—an outstanding Governor, one of the best Governors in the United States of America, and her Lieutenant Governor, who covers her in every way—both in terms of physically and mentally—[<i>laughter</i>]—and every other way. And thank you for all you did to help me get elected. I really mean it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>, <p>Look, I know there's a lot of noise in Washington; there always is. But it seems to me, a little more than usual now: a whole lot of hyperbole, a lot of heat. And I'm here today to try to set some things straight, if I can. I want to talk about what's fundamentally at stake for our country now, at this moment.</p>, <p>I know it's an overused phrase, but I've been using it a lot: We're at an inflection point. Every—anywhere from 40 to 80 years in America, there's an inflection point where we have to choose what direction we're going to go, what we're going to do. Not—not Democrat/Republican, but what are we going—who are we going to be?</p>, <p>For a long time, America set the pace across the entire globe. For the better part of the 20th century, we led the world by a significant margin in investments in ourselves, in our people, in our country. We invested in our infrastructure—in our roads, highways, bridges, ports, airports—in the arteries of the Nation that allow commerce to function smoothly and swiftly and allow us to generate significant income.</p>, <p>We've invested in our people, in opportunity. We're among the first to provide access, for example, to free education. It's the reason why, in the 20th century, we began to take off. It was back in the late 1890s we decided, among the first countries, that we were going to be the first nation that every single American, regardless of their background—and it wasn't, at the time, regardless of their background, but based on income—would have free 12 years of education. We invested to win the space race. We led the world in research and development that led to the creation of the internet.</p>, <p>And you know, but then something happened. We slowed up. We stopped investing in ourselves. America is still the largest economy in the world. We still have the most productive workers and most innovative minds in the world. But we risk losing our edge as a nation.</p>, <p>Our infrastructure used to be the best in the world, literally, not figuratively. Today, according to the World Economic Forum, we rank 13th. Our infrastructure—12 nations have a better infrastructure than we do, which means they can move product, they can do so many things better than we can do it.</p>, <p>We're among the first in the world to guarantee access to universal education. Now, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development ranks America 35th out of 37 major countries when it comes to investing in early childhood education as a percent of GDP.</p>, <p>Think of that. Think of that. Of all the industrial nations in the world, the instinct Americans would say, if you asked them 25 years—they would say, ""We're number one."" We are not. There's only two industrial nations that are lower than us.</p>, <p>All those investments that fueled a strong economy, we've taken our foot off the gas. We've taken—we just—I don't know what's happened. The world has taken notice, by the way, including our adversaries. And now they're closing the gap in a big way.</p>, <p>So it's essential that we regain our momentum that we've lost. And work our—you know, the work of our time, it seems to me—those of us who hold public office—is to prepare ourselves to be more competitive and to win the fast-changing 21st century and the global economy.</p>, <p>Things are changing incredibly quickly. That's why I proposed two critical pieces of legislation being debated back in Washington right now. The first, a bill to invest in our physical infrastructure. And the second is a bill to invest in our human infrastructure. I'll talk about both of these bills in just a moment.</p>, <p>But first I want to set one thing straight: These bills are not about left versus right or moderate versus progressive or anything that pits Americans against one another. These bills are about competitiveness versus complacency. They're about opportunity versus decay. They're about leading the world or continuing to let the world pass us by, which is literally happening.</p>, <p>To support these investments is to create a rising America, America that's moving. To oppose these investments is to be complicit in America's decline. To support these bills is to pursue a broader vision of our Nation. And to oppose them is to accept a very cramped view of our future. This isn't about two pieces of legislation, it's about the inflection point I mentioned earlier we are in our history—the world history.</p>, <p>So here's what I'm proposing. First, the infrastructure bill: It's about rebuilding our roads, our highways, our bridges, our ports, our airports, our broadband—all the things that need repair. Our arteries of our economy have always been fueled by the economic might and dynamism of Americans.</p>, <p>Across the country right now, 45,000 bridges and 173,000 miles of roads, according to the engineers—Society of Engineers—are in poor condition right now, including more than 1,200 bridges, as the Governor has been fighting to repair here in your State; seventy-three—7,300 miles of roads here in Michigan.</p>, <p>I'll bet everyone in this room can tell me what the most dangerous intersection in this town or any town they live in—and where it is—that you hold your breath when you're driving over or trying to cross the street. Not a joke.</p>, <p>Working with the Governor and Members of the Congress here, we're going to put hard-working Americans, like the operating engineers here in Howell, on the job to bring back our infrastructure and bring it up to speed. Good union jobs, not 12, 15, 18 dollars—prevailing wage jobs. Wage that gives you dignity, that you can raise a family on, that you can hold your head up. This is a blue-collar blueprint for how we restore America's pride. And the jobs can't—these are jobs that can't be outsourced.</p>, <p>We're going to put plumbers and pipefitters to work replacing lead pipes in America so families and children can drink clean water. Forty—400,000 schools. I mean, this—it's not just our homes; it's across the country. We're going to put line workers and electricians to work laying thousands of miles of transmission lines and to build a modern infrastructure and energy grid.</p>, <p>We're going to make high-speed internet affordable and available to everywhere in America. We were talking about it on the way over with Elissa, that how short the number of—number who have access to the internet here, because of the lack of investment.</p>, <p>We're going to make the largest investment in public transit in American history. And we're going to make the most important investment in our rail system since the creation of Amtrak 50 years ago.</p>, <p>Now, let me tell you, our competitors aren't hanging around and waiting to see what we're going to do. They've been pouring billions of dollars into infrastructure and into training their people for years now. Take China, for example. Now, I've been clear that China uses unfair, coercive practices to get ahead of their competitors. But that's not the whole of the story. They also invest in themselves.</p>, <p>In recent years, China has spent around three times as much on infrastructure as a share of their economy than we have. Three times. And they're not slowing down. Yesterday my U.S. Trade Representative delivered an important speech on our competition with China. She pointed out that China made a major investment in steel plants beginning about 20 years ago. And in the last 20 years, half of America's steel companies have been shuttered.</p>, <p>We went from 100 U.S. steel companies to 51. And employment in the American steel industry dropped by 40 percent since the year 2000. China now produces more steel in 1 month than America does in an entire year. You can see it in the sector after sector: Other countries are speeding up and America is falling behind.</p>, <p>We've got to reset the pace again. We've got to set a different pace. For example, here in Michigan, we need to make sure that American autoworkers lead the world in electric vehicles. And some of you came to the White House when I had the chairmen of the board of General Motors, Chrysler, and GM—I mean, General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford. You know—and what have they decided to do? They decided they're going to lead the world, and they're going to build more of the electric vehicles than any other country.</p>, <p>But guess what? China is not waiting around. They've manufactured more than twice as many electric vehicles as we have over the last decade. They control more than 75 percent of the battery market. And they're poised to invest another $14 billion in charging capacity now in their country.</p>, <p>Back in May, I had the chance to tour Ford's new state-of-the-art facility in Dearborn, where union workers are building the first-ever all-electric Ford F-150. I got to drive that sucker. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's quick: 0 to 60 in 4.1 seconds. And it's a big boy. It's a big one.</p>, <p>Months later, I hosted the three—the Big Three automakers at the White House, where the Ford 150 was joined by the GMC Hummer and the Jeep Wagoneer [Wrangler],* all going electric, all in partnership with the UAW.</p>, <p>The whole world knows that the future of the auto industry is electric. We need to make sure America builds that future instead of falling behind. We should build those vehicles, and the batteries to get them, here in the United States of America. That's what we should build here in the State of Michigan. I want those jobs—no, I really mean it. I want those jobs here in Michigan, not halfway around the globe.</p>, <p>That's what my plan will do. The infrastructure bill will put in motion the union workers on the job installing a national network of hundreds of thousands of charging stations along our roads and highways and communities, over 500,000 of them.</p>, <p>And by the way, parenthetically, when you build a charging station, it's like back in the day when my grandpop worked for the American Oil Company back in the turn of the—in the 19—1920s, in that area. They went from State to State convincing people that they put—allowed them to put 20,000 gallons of gasoline under the ground. They didn't want them around. But guess what happened? Everything builds up around them. You put these charging stations along the highway, and you're going to see a significant economic development go well beyond the charging station.</p>, <p>And the Build Back Better plan will boost our manufacturing capacity, investing in new and retooled facilities that employ American workers with good wages and benefits. That includes grants to kickstart new battery and parts productions, that—purchasing incentives for families to buy clean, union-made vehicles, like the ones championed by Debbie and Dan in the Senate and the House. And loans and tax credits to boost clean-vehicle manufacturing.</p>, <p>Look, these are the kinds of investments that get America in the game and give our workers a chance. My plan also makes historic investments in clean energy, including tax credits to help people do things like weatherize their homes, install solar panels, develop clean energy products, to help businesses produce more clean energy. All told, this project will save literally hundreds of millions of barrels of oil on a yearly basis. Not a joke.</p>, <p>These credits—those credits could cut the cost of installing a rooftop solar by about 30 percent, helping families cut their utility bills and helping the country cut its emissions.</p>, <p>My infrastructure bill will put Americans to work on long-overdue national environmental cleanups. I want a job corps just like Roosevelt had a jobs corps—but an environmental job corps of over 160,000—excuse me—1.6 million people. That means good jobs at prevailing wages capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil wells. You know, we have thousands and thousands of abandoned oil wells and gas wells and methane—with methane leaks. Well, guess what? The miners and the people who dug those wells, they'll get paid the same amount of money to cap them now. It's going to help us meet the moment of the climate crisis and do away with—you know, it's going to create good jobs and make it more—make us more economically competitive.</p>, <p>Folks, here in Michigan, you all know the cost of extreme weather. All of you remember the flooding this summer that shut down parts of I-96, the power outages, and the tornado warnings. They're costing your state billions of dollars. Nationally, last year—last year—because of extreme weather, cost America $99 billion. Ninety-nine billion taxpayers' dollars.</p>, <p>I went all over the country. I went out West to the fires. You know, more has burned down in the Northwest than the entire State of New Jersey. That's how much we've lost. You see what's happened with the droughts that are out there. You see reservoirs that are down 30, 40, 50 feet. Who's worried about the cooling down—you're worried about whether you're going to have—what the Colorado River is going to do.</p>, <p>This is a big deal. This is gigantic. And we're not going to ease up. We're not going to ease up on any of this. We have to invest in resilience. Resilience. You saw Texas? Their entire power grid went down because they had no resilience—the ability to build back and build things stronger.</p>, <p>Why a lot of those fires in the far West? And—because guess what? It's a hell of a lot safer to have those wires underground not be knocked down by high winds and tornadoes and the like, causing fires.</p>, <p>Look, I haven't pressed—I haven't a passed a—we haven't passed a major infrastructure bill for decades in this country. It used to be a normal thing to do. It used to be a bipartisan thing to do. If we get this done, we're going to breathe new life into our economy and our workers, and we're going to breathe cleaner air. Economists left, right, and center agree.</p>, <p>Earlier this year, Wall Street—not some liberal think tank—Wall Street and a Wall Street outfit called Moody's projected that the investments in these bills could help our economy create an additional 2 million jobs per year, every year. Two million per year. That's going to be transformative.</p>, <p>And here's the deal: The jobs in my plan are people who too often felt left behind and were left behind—left out. Ninety percent of the jobs in this bill—these bills—in my infrastructure plan don't require a 4-year college degree.</p>, <p>We need to get this done. But it isn't enough just to invest in our physical infrastructure. We're going to lead the world like we used to. If we're going to do that, we have to also invest in our people, like you do right here in training—in this training facility. And that's what my second bill, the Build Back Better plan, that's what it does.</p>, <p>Take education, for example. When America said everyone is entitled to 12 years of free public education—universal—a century ago, it gave us the best educated, best prepared workforce in the world. That was one of the reasons why America began to grow so rapidly. It's a big part of why we led the world the bulk of the 20th century.</p>, <p>But guess what? If we were going to put together a committee today, like they did in 1898—I think it was—and we were going to invent a public education system, is there any chance we'd say that we thought 12 years is enough in the 21st century? Just 12 years? I don't think so.</p>, <p>Study after study shows that the earlier our children begin to learn in school—not daycare—the better for themselves, for their families, no matter what the background they come from—no matter what their background.</p>, <p>Recent university studies point out that they're increased by 56 percent the chance for them to get all the way through 12 years of school without getting in trouble. It's a gigantic deal. It doesn't matter whether their mom or dad know how to read or write or the home is a home that is challenging.</p>, <p>But right now we're lagging behind, while other countries are investing in their children. Today, only about half of 3- and 4-year-olds in America are enrolled in early childhood education. In Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Latvia, the number—that number is more than 90 percent. Ninety percent of their 3- and 4-year-olds.</p>, <p>We're falling further and further behind the curve. It's not just early education. According to one study, we rank 33 out of 44 advanced economies when it comes to the percentage of our young people who have attained a post-high school degree, anything after high school. We're at the bottom of the heap. I'll bet if I—if that was on a quiz—you were on one of these quiz shows, they ask you that, you would have said maybe we're two or three or four. It's ridiculous.</p>, <p>My Build Back Better plan gets us back on track. We'll make 4 additional years of public education available to every person in America. Two years of high-quality preschool at the front end and investments in community colleges so our students can gain the skills they need to carve out a place for themselves in the 21st-century economy.</p>, <p>And it will also increase Pell grants. They're grants for kids making—families making less than 50 grand, helping their—helping their folks—helping them get through community college or a Historically Black Colleges in order to be able to get a shot so they can live; they can eat while they're going to school.</p>, <p>And we'll invest in our Historically Black College and Universities, which are an essential asset to help, to support, and to make sure that young people of every background and circumstance have a shot at good-paying jobs.</p>, <p>Look, this bill also invests in our workforce by providing so-much-needed breathing room for working families. After all, how can we compete in the world if millions of American parents, especially moms, can't join the week—the workforce because they can't afford the cost of childcare or eldercare; they have to stay home.</p>, <p>For example, here in Michigan, the average two-parent family spends $10,400 on childcare costs for just one child each year. Thirty years ago, the United States ranked sixth—sixth—among advanced economies in the share of women in the workforce. You know where we are today? Twenty-three. Twenty-two countries have a higher percentage of their women in the workforce making a competitive wage than the United States.</p>, <p>While our competitors are investing in the care economy, we're standing still. And the fact is, millions of American parents are feeling the squeeze, having a hard time doing their job, earning a paycheck while taking care of their children or aging parents—and at the same time—in the sandwich generation.</p>, <p>My Build Back Better plan is going to change that. It's going to cut the cost of childcare for most Michigan families by more than half. It's going to extend the historic middle class tax cut to the childcare tax credit, which we passed in my American Rescue Plan.</p>, <p>Now, most people don't know—if you walk to the average informed person—doctor, lawyer, whatever—and said, ""childcare tax credit,"" they're not sure what that means. But what it means is, you know, if you were making a decent salary and you had two kids or three kids or four under the age of 18, you get to deduct $2,000 for each child off your bottom line of your taxes you owe. Well, guess what? If you're making 15 bucks an hour, you don't have any taxes to pay like that. So guess what you got? Nothing. Zero. Zero. No help.</p>, <p>My friends on the other team have no problem giving billionaires and millionaires gigantic tax breaks. This is a tax cut. You know, what it does is, now—and it's in place, and people in your State are understanding it now—instead of it provides—it upped the ante how much you could get for a child under 7: You get 3,600 bucks tax cut on a yearly basis, and you get $3,000 for a child under 17.</p>, <p>But guess what we did? That means we're doing it on a monthly basis now. It means you're getting either $300 a month or $200 a month, just like a Social Security check—at home. It's cut child poverty in—by 40 percent. That money is already a life-changer for so many working families. And as I said—it's actually—I was wrong: In Michigan, it's 44 percent cut in child poverty.</p>, <p>We need to keep it going. My plan is going to put Americans to work constructing and rehabilitating safe and affordable housing to help ease the cost of housing while generating even more jobs. In most of the major metropolitan areas of America, they're—you can't afford the housing.</p>, <p>And it helps to meet the moment on climate change as well. We're setting the course for America to achieve 50- to 52-percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 for us to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. This bill helps us get there in a way that creates good jobs, makes us global leaders of fast-growing clean energy industries, like electric vehicles, solar and wind power, battery power.</p>, <p>The bottom line is this: When we give working families a break, we're not just raising their quality of life; we're putting parents in a position to earn a paycheck. We're also positioning our country to compete in the world. That's what these bills are all about.</p>, <p>If you want proof, just come to this training facility. This is where hard-working folks come to learn how to operate road graders and so much more; where workers use virtual reality to master operating a crane and to learn how to deal with drones to look underneath bridges and so on; where young people in Michigan show up and emerge as expert technicians, engineers, heavy equipment operators.</p>, <p>They leave here with a shot at something great: a union job with good wages and benefits that allow them to maintain their dignity and their pride. It's a ticket to the middle class.</p>, <p>This is where the economy starts: with you—your skills, your dreams, and your limitless potential. The only thing we've been missing is the will from Washington to finally build an economy around you, an economy that gives you and your family a fighting chance to get ahead, gives our country a fighting chance to compete with the rest of the world. We can't get here thinking small. We have to think big.</p>, <p>Let me be clear: We need to prepare for 10 years down the line. That's what these bills do. Both these bills spend out over 10 years, not in the first year.</p>, <p>So if you take the infrastructure bill, folks, it's described as a $1.2 trillion bill. What that means is that of all those investments in roads, bridges, high-speed internet, water, everything else, all of it would be less than one-half of 1 percent of our economy each year. And it's all paid for, and they don't increase the debt, because they're paid for by asking the very wealthy to begin their—pay their fair share. As a matter of fact, a significant portion of this plan cuts taxes for working people.</p>, <p>And best of all, the cost of these bills, in terms of adding to the deficit, is zero. Zero. Zero. And I made a commitment when I wrote these when I was running: No one making under $400,000 a year will see a penny in their taxes go up. That's why, in the infrastructure bill, there is no gas tax increase, because people making under 400 would have to pay more.</p>, <p>It's simple. If you're working here at this facility or your spouse is a teacher or a firefighter, there's no reason why—combined—why millionaires and billionaires in this country should be paying at a lower tax rate than you do. Hear me again now: a lower tax rate. A police officer or teacher, a union crane operator, and a nurse, they paid a higher tax rate—a higher tax rate—than a significant portion of the major corporations in America and the superwealthy.</p>, <p>Look, it isn't right—isn't right—that 55 of the largest corporations in America, in this country—and I come from the corporate capital of the world. More people—more corporations are incorporated in the State of Delaware than all—every other State combined. But you know how much those 55 companies—I could go on; more than that—they made over $40 billion and they paid zero—zero—in Federal income tax.</p>, <p>Since the pandemic began, the number of billionaires—and I forget the exact number there are in America—have seen their wealth go up collectively by $1 trillion—$1 trillion. It isn't fair. It needs to change. Look, working folks understand that.</p>, <p>That's why, despite the attacks and misinformation, my plan has overwhelming support of the polling data from the American people. They understand what's at stake. They understand that workers and families have a better shot and Americans have a better shot.</p>, <p>I'm a capitalist. I think you should be able to go out and make a million dollars or a billion. But just pay your fair share. Join the crowd, man.</p>, <p>They know that this is about dignity and respect. It's about changing the paradigm so the economy works for you, not just for those at the very top. It's about building this economy from the bottom up and the middle out. That's what I've done my entire career. That's why I ran for President.</p>, <p>As I said, I'm a capitalist. I think you should be able to make a lot of money in America. But just pay your fair share. Pay your fair share.</p>, <p>I took this agenda to the country. They said it was time to build an economy that looks out from Scranton, Pennsylvania—where I grew up as a kid—instead of looking down from Wall Street. An economy that looks out from Howell, Michigan, and towns like it all over America, that brings people from every race, background, religion into the game.</p>, <p>That's what—and notwithstanding some of the signs that I saw coming in—that's why 81 million Americans voted for me. The largest number of votes in American history.<i> </i>A clear majority who supported when they supported me. Look, it's now time to deliver.</p>, <p>Let me close with this: The world is watching. Not a joke. The autocrats of the world believe the world is moving so rapidly that democracies can't generate consensus quickly enough to bring their people together to get things done.</p>, <p>They think democracies—not a joke—in my meetings with Putin, in my meetings with Xi Jinping and other leaders, they truly believe that we can't compete in the 21st century because things are moving so fast, democracies take so much time, that they are so divided, that they can't get together in time to act.</p>, <p>They believe they'll win—they'll win the day—and they can dictate their way forward and leave us behind. They're betting—not a joke—they're betting, for the first time, we won't respond to this inflection point in history, that we'll fail to rise to the occasion. But you've heard me say it a lot of times: It's never, ever been a good bet to bet against the American people. Never.</p>, <p>Look, just look back a little ways. After World War II, the United States did what we're trying to do now: invested in the American people to lead the world. At the time, Presidents and Congresses of both parties and Americans of all political views stepped up. I'm not being sentimental here. There was racial discrimination; it was a fact of life. We know how deep-rooted racism is in this country. We saw the Klan marching right here in Howell generations ago and again in recent years. It's a never-ending battle.</p>, <p>But think about what also unfolded in this critical—in these critical decades. Great protest movements summoned the Nation to most—promise of equity. The GI bill sent millions of veterans to college. The federal government helped make home ownership possible because it's the vehicle by which people can generate wealth. Most of us who come from lower or middle class backgrounds, that's how our parents were able to generate any wealth. The investments in our home for those who could previously only dream of having a house to call their own.</p>, <p>We invested in the Interstate Highway System, propelling our economy into the future. We invested in the space race, which led to huge strides in technology. We invested in something called DARPA, a program within the Federal Government that helped create the internet.</p>, <p>Folks, we need to step up again. But the challenge of today is one of economic competition. Let's learn from that history, not because it was perfect, because Americans then did what they must do now: invest in ourselves to show the world that American democracy works and that, given half a chance, there's nothing—not a single thing—we can't achieve when we do it together. I know we can do this. I'm positive we can. And I've never been more optimistic about this country than I am right now. We're going to restore faith, pride, and dignity in the future of this country.</p>, <p>And we're going to pass both of these bills and start building this economy to beat the competition and deliver for working families.</p>, <p>Thank you, may God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Let's get this done. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Budget Reconciliation Process </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>President Biden, what are you willing to cut to get to $2 trillion?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>President Biden, what are you willing to cut from the package to get to $2 trillion?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I want to make sure that we have a package that everyone can agree on.

7,6,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the Public Debt Limit and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-public-debt-limit-and-exchange-with-reporters,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good morning. It will come as no surprise to you, I'd like to talk about what we need today to raise the debt limit and why the Republicans in Congress are—what they're doing today is so reckless and dangerous, in my view.</p>, <p>Raising the debt limit comes down to paying what we already owe, what has already been acquired, not anything new. It starts with a simple truth: The United States is a nation that pays its bills and always has. From its inception, we have never defaulted.</p>, <p>What we pay for is what keeps us a great nation: Social Security benefits for seniors, salaries for brave servicemembers and benefits for veterans, and other financial obligations for our people and for our Nation. We're able to meet these obligations based on the revenue we receive from taxes and based on our ability to borrow what—when needed.</p>, <p>And in that case, we're able to borrow because we always pay our debt. We always pay what we owe. We've never failed. That's America. That's who we are. That's what's called for. It's called ""full faith and credit of the United States."" It's rock solid. It's the best in the world.</p>, <p>But here's the deal: There's a cap on what we can borrow called the ""debt limit."" And only Congress can raise or lower that debt limit. So let me be really clear. This is really important to know: Raising the debt limit is about paying off our old debts. It has nothing to do with any new spending being considered. It has nothing to do with my plan for infrastructure or building back better. Zero. Zero. Both of which, I might add, are paid for.</p>, <p>So, if we're going to make good on what's already been approved by previous Congresses and previous Presidents and parties, we have to pay for it: Social Security benefits the American people were promised, salaries for service men and women, benefits for veterans, we're going to have to raise the debt limit if we're going to meet those obligations. And raising the debt limit is usually a bipartisan undertaking. And it should be. That's what is not happening today.</p>, <p>The reason we have to raise the debt limit is, in part, because of the reckless tax and spending policies under the previous Trump administration. In 4 years, they incurred nearly $8 trillion—in 4 years, $8 trillion—in additional debt and bills we have to now pay off. That's more than a quarter of the entire debt incurred now outstanding after more than 200 years.</p>, <p>And Republicans in Congress raised the debt three times when Donald Trump was President, and each time with Democrat support. But now they won't raise it even though they are responsible for more than $8 trillion in bills incurred in 4 years under the previous administration. That's what we'd be paying off.</p>, <p>They won't raise it even though defaulting on the debt would lead to a self-inflicted wound that takes our economy over a cliff and risks jobs and retirement savings, Social Security benefits, salaries for servicemembers, benefits for veterans, and so much more.</p>, <p>A failure to raise the debt limit will call into question Congress's willingness to meet our obligations that we've already incurred—not new ones; we've already incurred. This is going to undermine the safety of U.S. Treasury securities. And it will threaten the reserve status of the dollar as the world's currency that the world relies on. American credit rating will be downgraded. Interest rates will rise for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards borrowing.</p>, <p>Folks watching at home, you should know this is the Republican position. Here's what it is: They won't vote to raise the debt limit to cover their own spending. Democrats voted with them to cover that spending the last 4 years—the previous 4 years. They say Democrats should do it alone.</p>, <p>But then they're threatening to use a procedural power called the filibuster, meaning that we'd have to get 60 votes—not 50 votes—to increase the debt limit. This would block the Democrats from meeting our obligations and responsibilities to prevent Congress from raising the debt limit.</p>, <p>So let's be clear: Not only are Republicans refusing to do their job, they're threatening to use the power—their power to prevent us from doing our job: saving the economy from a catastrophic event. I think, quite frankly, it's hypocritical, dangerous, and disgraceful.</p>, <p>Their obstruction and irresponsibility knows absolutely no bounds——</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President coughed.</i>]</p>, <p>——excuse me—especially as we're clawing our way out of this pandemic. Democrats will meet our responsibility and obligation to this country. We're not expecting Republicans to do their part. They've made that clear from the beginning.</p>, <p>We've tried asking to no avail. We're just asking them not to use procedural tricks to block us from doing the job that they won't do.</p>, <p>A meteor is headed to crash into our economy. Democrats are willing to do all the work stopping it. Republicans just have to let us do our job; just get out of the way. If you don't want to help save the country, get out of the way so you don't destroy it.</p>, <p>We don't have time to delay with elaborate procedural schemes—which Republicans' proposals require—scores of votes without any certainty at all, many of which have nothing to do with the debt limit at all. And that's when accidents happen.</p>, <p>In the days ahead, even before the default date, people may see the value of their retirement accounts shrink. They may see interest rates go up, which will ultimately raise their mortgage payments and car payments. And the American people—look, I'll just say it this way: As soon as this week, your savings and your pocket—your pocketbook could be directly impacted by this Republican stunt. It's as simple as that.</p>, <p>Republicans say they will not do their part to avoid this needless calamity. So be it. But they need to stop playing Russian roulette with the U.S. economy. It's one thing to pay our debts already acquired. It's another to require a supermajority to pay the debts already acquired. It's not right.</p>, <p>Let the Democrats vote to raise the debt ceiling this week without obstruction or further delays. Democrats in the House have already passed a bill that would do that. It's sitting in the United States Senate, where Democrats have the votes ready to pass it. That's the only way to eliminate the uncertainty and risk that's going to harm American families and our economy.</p>, <p>Let us vote and end the mess. You know, we've got to get this done. We must get this done. It is like, as I said, playing Russian roulette to play these games. We can do it this week. Just get out of the way and let us pass it.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Senate Minority Leader A. Mitchell McConnell/Use of the Filibuster in the Senate </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, Senator Mitch McConnell says he has sent a letter to you explaining his view. Have you seen that letter? Have you communicated with him?</p>, <p><i>The President</i>. I have. Sorry.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> And how dire do you believe this is if action doesn't take place in the next few days?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> First of all, I did get a letter. I got it 10 minutes before I walked in here. I've read it. I plan on talking to Mitch about it. He and I have been down this road once before, back when I was Vice President. And I hope we can have some intelligent and honest conversation about what he's proposing.</p>, <p>And I think the easiest way to do this—and if the Republicans would not use the filibuster—would be to let us vote on what is already in the Senate right now, passed by the House, to raise the debt limit. And we could do that in the next several days.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>The President's Legislative Agenda </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. You've often touted your experience in the Senate, your 36 years in the Senate. Your aides have talked about your abilities to be a closer on deals involving legislation. Why were you unable, Mr. President, to close the deal with members of your own party on key parts of your legislative agenda last week? Thank you.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I was able to close the deal on 99 percent of my party. [<i>Laughter</i>] Two. Two people. That's still underway. I don't think there's been a President who's been able to close deals—has been in a position where he has only 50 votes in the Senate and a bare majority in the House. This is a process. This is a process. We'll get it done.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, it sounds like you're putting the blame squarely on two U.S. Senators for your inability to close that deal: Senator Sinema and Senator Manchin. Am I incorrect? Is that who the blame lies with?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Look, I need 50 votes in the Senate. I have 48.</p>, <p><i>Budget Reconciliation Process/Public Debt Limit </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, Leader Schumer has vowed not to raise the debt ceiling through the reconciliation process. So, ultimately, if push——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Say that again. I'm sorry.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Leader Schumer has said he won't raise the debt ceiling through the reconciliation process. So, ultimately, if push comes to shove, and Senator McConnell does not change his position, what is more important: that position that Senator Schumer has, or raising the debt ceiling?</p>, <p>And then I also have a question for you on Ethiopia, if you would.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm going answer one—I'm not going to answer Ethiopia. Let's stick on the debt so we don't confuse the American people.</p>, <p>Number one, the issue of reconciliation, which is like code to the American people—""What's reconciliation?""—there is a process that I understand the Republican leader is willing to initiate, go through, that would require literally up to hundreds of votes. It's unlimited number of votes having nothing directly to do with the debt limit; it could be everything from Ethiopia to anything else that has nothing to do with the debt limit. And it's fraught with all kinds of potential danger for a miscalculation, and it would have to happen twice.</p>, <p>So you could literally have several hundred votes over the next number of days. Everything else would come to a standstill, but you still find yourself in a situation where, at the end of the day, we may have passed something that, in fact, then has to be undone again by either Democrats or Republicans.</p>, <p>It's an incredibly complicated, cumbersome process, when there's a very simple process sitting out there. Sitting at the desk in the United States Senate is a bill passed by the House, saying: ""We, Democrats, will raise the debt limit, take responsibility for raising it, even though we didn't—some voted to acquire the debt as well. We will go ahead and do that."" That's the way to proceed.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>But if it comes down to reconciliation or raising the debt ceiling, which position would you take?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm not going to cross that bridge until we have to get there.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, on the——</p>, <p><i>Ethiopia </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Can you address the allegations of genocide and why you haven't yet imposed those sanctions that you authorized 2 weeks ago, sir?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'll speak to that later.</p>, <p><i>Senator Kyrsten L. Sinema </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Regarding your Build Back Better agenda, we know the topline figure from Senator Manchin is $1.5 trillion. Senator Kyrsten Sinema has yet to really give that number of where she's willing to go to go or how high she's willing to go. But she says she's negotiating in good faith with the White House. What is her figure?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'll let her tell you that. I don't want to—we're in negotiations.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Is it between 1.5 and 3.5? Is it higher, at least, than the 1.5?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm not going to negotiate in public here.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Sir——</p>, <p><i>Public Debt Limit </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, how is what the Republicans are doing now any different from when you opposed raising the debt limit as a Senator during the Bush years?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Because we weren't calling for filibuster. We did—not requiring 60 votes. And it was a straight up-and-down vote.</p>, <p><i>Public Pressure on Democratic Senators </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, just one—Mr. President, you're talking about how you have 48 Democratic votes right now. The other two have been pressured, over the weekend, by activists. Joe Manchin had people on kayaks show up to his boat to yell at him. Senator Sinema, last night, was chased into a restroom. Do you think that those tactics are crossing a line?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I don't think they're appropriate tactics, but it happens to everybody from the—[<i>laughter</i>]—the only people it doesn't happen to are people who have Secret Service standing around them. So it's part of the process.</p>, <p>Yes, sir. You—go ahead.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>And, Mr. President, just really quickly. A lot of people have been trying to attach immigration——</p>, <p><i>The President's Legislative Agenda/Education/Childcare </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, your—I know you don't want to comment on other Senators' positions in the negotiations, but what do you think the size of the reconciliation package should be? What specific dollar figure?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I've laid out what I thought it should be. It's not going to be that; it's going to be less. I mean, look, the legislation—both the Build Back Better piece, as well as the infrastructure piece—are things that I wrote. These are—these didn't come from, God love them, Bernie Sanders or A.O.C. or anybody else. I wrote them. I disagreed with ""Medicare for all,"" for example. I disagreed—but I laid out what I thought would be important.</p>, <p>For example, I think—from the Build Back Better program—it's required that we in fact have the best education available to us. And I'll be speaking to this in detail tomorrow.</p>, <p>But look, here's the situation: How can we, in an ever-competitive world, increasingly competitive world—how can we not meet the educational standards of—at least other countries are working toward? Nobody is reducing the number of years they want their children to go to school or people to go school.</p>, <p>You've heard me say it before, as my wife says: If we don't—if any country outeducates us, they're going to outcompete us. Look what China is doing. Look what the rest of the world is doing. They're investing.</p>, <p>They're also investing in things that relate to ability for people to go to work and stay at work. We have several million women who can't go back to work because they don't have any way to take care of their children. So, to give a tax cut to a working mom to be able to afford daycare, is that bad? Is that a bad idea? I think it's a darn good idea. It will get people back to work.</p>, <p>So there's a lot of things in the legislation I'm going to be talking about across the country that I think the American people overwhelmingly support. But the idea that somehow this is somebody else's legislation—this is what I wrote.</p>, <p><i>Budget Reconciliation Process </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>But, sir, would you accept a $2 trillion—say, a $2 trillion reconciliation bill? Would that be acceptable to you?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Again, it—as you know, it's not a smart thing to negotiate with yourself in public. Let's see—we're in the process of continuing to talk to all the parties and see what we can get done.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Sir, Mr. President, sir——</p>, <p><i>Pandora Papers Leak/The President's Legislative Agenda </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you so much, Mr. President. Two questions. First, you said there was progress in the negotiation. But today, you said you only have 48 votes. So what is this progress?</p>, <p>And another question on a foreign—an international news that was big yesterday about the Pandora Papers. Do you have any reaction? You put fight against corruption as the core——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> About what? I'm sorry, I didn't get the last part.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Pandora Papers. The Pandora Papers. You had said that you put fight against corruption in the core of your national security policy. So what is your reaction? And do you plan to do anything about it?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> We're looking at that right now. And the first part of your question was what?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Was about progress. What does progress look like for you in the negotiations?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Winning. That's the progress. The last question, all the way at the back.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Sir, on the Hyde Amendment, the Hyde Amendment——</p>, <p><i>Public Debt Limit/Senate Minority Leader A. Mitchell McConnell </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, you—I just want to be very clear: Can you guarantee that the U.S. will not breach the debt ceiling, that that will not happen?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I can't. That's up to Mitch McConnell.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>So it is possible that the U.S. will not pay its debt? That is possible—that is a real possibility?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I can't believe that that will be the end result because the consequence is so dire. I don't believe that. But can I guarantee it? If I could, I would, but I can't.</p>, <p>Thank you all very much. Appreciate it.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Sir, the Hyde Amendment: Senator Manchin says the deal is off if the Hyde Amendment is not included? Do you support that?</p>]"

Good morning, sir. Mr. President, good morning.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Are you confident——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> How are you, sir?</p>, <p><i>Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation/Budget Reconciliation Process </i></p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, what is your message to moderates who are frustrated with the delay in the vote?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Everybody is frustrated. It's part of being in Government, being frustrated.</p>, <p>Hey, look, one of the things I love about you guys—I watched the other day: ""Biden vowed he's going to do this. Biden commits."" Biden is going to work like hell to make sure we get both of these passed, and I think we will get them passed.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Will there be——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And I'll be on the phone with them a lot and may be meeting with some.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Are you confident——</p>, <p><i>Public Debt Limit/Education and Family Assistance Legislation/Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation/Tax Relief </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Do you think that Democrats need to go it alone and do reconciliation in order to pass—or raise the debt limit?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I hope that Republicans won't be so irresponsible as to refuse to raise the debt limit and to filibuster the debt limit. That would be totally unconscionable. Never been done before. And so I hope that won't happen. Number one.</p>, <p>Number two, with regard to dealing with childcare, dealing with the tax credits for people putting in everything from solar panels on their homes to winterizing their homes—I mean, they're making their homes so they—the windows and doors are solid. All those things are in that second piece of legislation. And I'm going to be going around the country, this week, making the case why that's so important.</p>, <p>Look, it's understandable. There's an awful lot that's in both of these bills that everybody thinks they know, but they don't know what's in them. I—when you go out and you test each of the individual elements in the bill, everyone is for them—not everyone; over 70 percent of the American people are for them.</p>, <p>For example, my objective here is to make sure we put in place the things that are going to make life more livable for ordinary people. I mean that sincerely. It's not—that's not a political statement, it's reality. You have people—a woman is trying to get back to work that has two kids; she can't get back unless she has adequate daycare and can afford it.</p>, <p>You can't be in a situation where if you have a child—why would someone making, say, 20,000 bucks a year not get a rebate, not get money back from the Government, just like you guys and I get when we file our taxes? We get $2,000 for every kid we have and just take it right off our taxes. But if they don't have any taxes to pay because they don't make any money, then they should get their direct payment back. Why should they be cheated out of that? It's about just being fair.</p>, <p>There's nothing in any of these pieces of legislation that's radical, that is unreasonable, that is—when you look at it individually.</p>, <p>The problem is—you know, one of the reasons why—people said, ""Well, I heard on television""—and it wasn't totally legit—""Why wasn't Biden going around the country selling this before?"" Well, folks, for a few little things, like we had hurricanes and floods, and we had little things like we had—[<i>laughter</i>]—anyway, a lot was going on. A lot was going on.</p>, <p>So I'm going to try to sell what I think the people—American people will buy.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Do you think——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And I'm convinced.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Do you think you can get them by Thanksgiving?</p>, <p><i>The President's Legislative Agenda </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Are you confident that Senator Sinema is going——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm not—look, I'm not—you're asking if I'm confident—okay?—am I unyielding, do I commit that I'm going to do this. Come on.</p>, <p>I believe I can get this done. I believe, when the American people are aware what's in it, we can get it done.</p>, <p><i>The President's Legislative Agenda </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Do you think by Thanksgiving, sir? Do you think this could be all done by Thanksgiving?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I think it can be done by 2:27 a.m. on December—come on. I think it will get done. Plenty of time for it to be part of changing the Tax Code for people next year and for giving people the breaks they need.</p>, <p><i>Timeline of Votes in Congress </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>You said everyone is frustrated. How frustrated are you, Mr. President, about the delay?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>President Biden, do you think the infrastructure plan can pass without a reconciliation framework?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm not.</p>, <p><i>Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation </i></p>, <p><i>Q.</i> What about—you said you were going to hit the road? Sir——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>President Biden, do you think the infrastructure plan can pass without a reconciliation framework agreed to?</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]—to Glasgow?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm sorry?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Do you think the infrastructure bill can pass the House without a reconciliation framework agreement?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Look, I am a realist. I've been—I was a Senator a long time. I know how legislation gets done. There is no reason why both these bills couldn't pass independently except that there's not the votes to do it that way. It's a simple proposition.</p>, <p>And so I think it makes sense I support both of them, and I think we can get them both done.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Sir, you said you wanted to hit the road——</p>, <p><i>Democratic Party </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>You've talked about how Democrats are united in their priorities, but have you been surprised by how difficult it has been to bring the moderates and progressives together on agreement with this?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> We can bring the moderates and progressives together very easy if we had two more votes.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Two.

7,8,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Shots and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-covid-19-vaccine-booster-shots-and-exchange-with-reporters,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody. How are you doing? [<i>Laughter</i>] Did you ever think you'd be seeing your press coming to watch someone get a shot in the old days? Me either. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Anyway, like I did in my first and second COVID-19 vaccination shot, I'm about to get my booster shot and do it publicly. That's because the Food and Drug Administration—the FDA—the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—looked at all the data, completed their review, and determined that boosters for the Pfizer vaccine—others will come later, maybe, I assume—but the Pfizer vaccine are safe and effective. They have all the data they need.</p>, <p>And last week, they laid out who is eligible for those boosters for now. You're eligible for a booster if it's been 6 months since your second Pfizer shot and if you fall into one of these categories: people over 65, which is hard to acknowledge; adults—I'm only joking, folks—adults with certain underlying health conditions like diabetes and obesity; and those who are at increased risk of COVID-19 because of where you work or where you live, like health care workers, teachers, first responders, grocery store clerks.</p>, <p>If you fall under these categories, you're eligible for the booster. Now, I know it doesn't look like it, but I am over 65—I wish I—[<i>laughter</i>]—way over. And that's why I'm getting my booster shot today.</p>, <p>The booster line is, if you're fully vaccinated—the bottom line is that if you're fully vaccinated and—you're highly protected now from severe illness, even if you get COVID-19. You're safe, and we're going to do everything we can to keep it that way with the boosters.</p>, <p>But let me be clear: Boosters are important, but the most important thing we need to do is get more people vaccinated. The vast majority of Americans are doing the right thing. Over 77 percent of adults have gotten at least one shot. About 23 percent haven't gotten any shots, and that distinct minority is causing an awful lot of us—an awful lot of damage for the rest of the country.</p>, <p>This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. That's why I'm moving forward with vaccination requirements wherever I can. On Wednesday, I'll be traveling to Chicago to talk about why it's so important that more businesses are instituting their own vaccine requirements.</p>, <p>We know that to beat this pandemic and to save lives, to keep our children safe, our schools open, our economy going, we need to get folks vaccinated. So, please—please—do the right thing. Please get the shots. And it can save your life. It can save the lives of those around you. And it's easy, accessible, and it's free.</p>, <p>So text your ZIP Code to 438829—that's 438829—or visit vaccines.gov to find a vaccination location near you. We can do this. Get vaccinated.</p>, <p>Thank you very much. Now, I'm going to get my booster shot and—right here. And the major is going to give me the shot.</p>, <p><i>The President's Reaction to the Coronavirus Vaccine </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Did you have any side effects with the second shot, Mr. President?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I haven't any side effects the first or second shot, thank goodness. I don't anticipate one now, but we'll see.</p>, <p>Is that high enough for you?</p>, <p><i>White House Medical Unit nurse. </i>Yes<i> </i></p>, <p><i>The First Lady's COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Shot </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Is the First Lady getting hers as well today, Mr. President?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> She's going to get one. Not that—I think she's teaching. She—but she's going to get one. Yes.</p>, <p><i>U.S. Global Distribution of Coronavirus Vaccines </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, what do you say to the world health leaders, like the World Health Organization, who say wealthy nations should help more countries without vaccinations to get vaccinated before they get boosters here in America?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> We are helping—we are doing more than every other nation in the world combined. We're going to have well over 1,100,000,000 shots, and we're going to continue going. We're going to do our part. We've also given a great deal of funding to COVAX, which is the vehicle that does this.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President received a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot.</i>]</p>, <p>So we have plenty, plenty of opportunities to make sure we get everyone in the world—to play our part—the largest part in the world of getting everyone vaccinated.</p>, <p><i>National Vaccination Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>How many Americans need to be vaccinated for us to go back to normal? Like, what is the percentage of total vaccinations that have to be deployed?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I think—look, I think we get the vast majority—like is going on in so many—some industries and some schools—96, 97, 98 percent. I think we're getting awful close. And—but I'm not the scientist.</p>, <p>I think—but one thing for certain: A quarter of the country can't go unvaccinated and us not continue to have a problem.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Budget Reconciliation Process </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Any progress on a reconciliation deal today, Mr. President? How close do you think you are?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> You know me, I'm a born optimist. I think things are going to go well. I think we're going to get it done. And—but I have meetings tonight, tomorrow, and for the next little bit.</p>, <p><i>The President's Legislative Agenda </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>So what is at stake——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, how do you define——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> What is at stake for your agenda and your Presidency with what's happening on the Hill this week?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Victory is what's at stake.</p>, <p><i>The President's Legislative Agenda </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, how would you define ""success"" this week, legislatively?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>[<i>Inaudible</i>]—sir?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>How would you define ""success,"" legislatively, by the end of this week?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, it may not be by the end of the week. I hope it's by the end of the week. But as long as we're still alive, the longer—we've got three things to do: the debt ceiling, the continuing resolution, and the two pieces of legislation. If we do that, the country is going to be in great shape.</p>, <p>Thank you very much.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>What's your message to Democrats, as you have these calls? What's your message to Democrats, Mr. President?</p>]"

It embodies an approach I spoke of at the U.N. earlier this week.</p>, <p>When we met 6 months ago, we made concrete commitments to advance our shared and positive agenda for a free and open Indo-Pacific. Today I'm proud to say that we're making excellent progress.</p>, <p>Our vaccine initiative is on track to produce an additional 1 billion doses of vaccine in India to boost global supply. We're taking action on climate change, with new partnership toward a zero-emissions shipping.</p>, <p>And today we're also launching a new Quad fellowship for students from each of our Quad countries to pursue advanced degrees leading—in leading STEM programs here in the United States. It represents an investment in the leaders, innovators, and pioneers of tomorrow.</p>, <p>In sum, we are four major democracies with a long history of cooperation. We know how to get things done, and we are up to the challenge. And I'm looking forward to our discussion today, and I thank you.</p>, <p>And now I yield to my friend from India.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Modi.</i> President Biden, Prime Minister Morrison, Prime Minister Suga: I thank President Biden for his initiative to organize this historic, first-ever in-person Quad Summit. Our four countries came together for the first time in 2004 to extend support to the Indo-Pacific region post the tsunami.</p>, <p>Today, when the world is grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, we are meeting once again, as Quad, and working in the interest of humanity, based—our Quad vaccine initiative will greatly help countries in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>, <p>Based on shared democratic values, Quad has decided to move forward with positive thinking and a positive approach. It gives me great pleasure to discuss with my friends wide-ranging topics from supply chains to global security, from climate action to COVID response, to cooperation in the field of technology.</p>, <p>I am—our Quad, in a sense, will play the role of a force for global good. I'm confident that our cooperation under Quad will ensure prosperity and peace in the Indo-Pacific and in the world. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Morrison.</i> Well, thank you very much, Prime Minister. Thank you, Mr. President. It is a great honor to be here with you, here in this magnificent place. And I thank you for your leadership and bringing us together, in person this time, and to join our great friends, Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Suga. And, Secretary Blinken, it's good to be here with you also.</p>, <p>We are liberal democracies that believe in a world order that favors freedom. And we believe in a free and open Indo-Pacific because we know that's what delivers a strong, stable, and prosperous region so our citizens, our peoples can realize their hopes and dreams for their futures in a liberal and free society.</p>, <p>The Quad is about demonstrating how democracies such as ours, as you said, Mr. President, can get things done that can deal with the big challenges that we face in a very complex and changing world. And there is no part of the world that is more dynamic than the Indo-Pacific at this time, a region that has extraordinary opportunity, wide diversity, great wealth, but many challenges that must be overcome.</p>, <p>And we see the role of our nations. We see our home in the Indo-Pacific as the place that we wish to focus on to ensure that our peoples can realize everything they would have for themselves.</p>, <p>So, as we gather here together again as a Quad, in person for the first time, in just 6 months from our last meeting, so much has already been accomplished. And we come together with great hope for what's ahead.</p>, <p>Six hundred and seventy million, at least, safe and effective doses of vaccines already out there. A billion is our goal, Mr. President, and we will add more to that today, using our national strengths collectively to manufacture and distribute these vaccines, to have the doses, but also to ensure they go that last mile to ensure they are administered in all parts of the region.</p>, <p>We're working together on low-emissions technologies that will indeed change the world and take the world to a net-zero economy: a new energy economy. We're working to make cyberspace and emerging and critical technologies trusted and secure in open societies, solving problems, and addressing the supply chain challenges that in many ways hold the keys to our security and our prosperity and our environment in the 21st century.</p>, <p>So we stand here together in the Indo-Pacific region, a region that we wish to be always free from coercion, where the sovereign rights of all nations are respected and where disputes are settled peacefully in accordance with international law. We come together in collective strength with mutual respect, transparently, and importantly, as one.</p>, <p>So thank you again, Mr. President, for joining us together as Quad leaders at this meeting. On behalf of the Australian people, can I thank all of the leaders of the Quad, who share this great forum, for their leadership in our region.</p>, <p>I'm in no doubt that together our four nations multiply many times over the forces of hope for a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific. And with that, I'm delighted to hand over to my dear friend, the Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Suga.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Suga.</i> Joe, Prime Minister Modi, Scott, it's a great pleasure to see you again.</p>, <p>Under Joe's leadership, as promised in March, we are here for the first-ever in-person Quad summit. This event demonstrates the strong solidarity between our four nations and our unwavering commitment to the common vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.</p>, <p>The Quad is an extremely significant initiative by four countries who share fundamental values, cooperating for the cause of realizing a free and open international order based on the rule of law in the Indo-Pacific. To date, the Quad, has been promoting practical cooperation in extensive areas to deal with regional challenges, including COVID-19.</p>, <p>At this summit, I hope we can take stock of concrete progress achieved so far and discuss ways to further expand the Quad cooperation in new areas, such as infrastructure and clean energy, and to promote people-to-people exchange in science and technology. I'm sure that we would be able to have an extremely fruitful meeting.</p>, <p>Further, the lifting of import restrictions by the United States against Japanese food products—including rice, vegetable, and other produces—from Fukushima Prefecture, which was a request I made to Joe in April, is a major step in supporting the recovery from the earthquake and tsunami. And we are most appreciative.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>, <p><i>President Biden. </i>Thank you.</p>]"
8,0,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-prime-minister-narendra-modi-india-0,"[<p><i>President Biden.</i> Well, welcome. I want to welcome my friend—and we've known each other for some time—back to the White House. And, Mr. Prime Minister, we're going to continue to build on our strong partnership.</p>, <p>When I showed the Prime Minister to his seat, I pointed out that seat is occupied almost every day by an Indian American. [<i>Laughter</i>] The Vice President's mother was from India, a scientist and a remarkable woman.</p>, <p>As I think you know, Mr. Prime Minister, I've long believed that the U.S.-India relationship can help us solve an awful lot of global challenges. In fact, back in 2006, I set that hope out, where I said that by 2020—when I was Vice President—2020, India and the United States would be among the closest nations in the world with one another.</p>, <p>And maybe I shouldn't—these are not part of my prepared remarks. But when I was in Mumbai, as Vice President, I finished meeting with the equivalent of the Chamber of Commerce. And afterwards, the Indian press asked me: Do I have any relatives in India?</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Modi.</i> Yes. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> And I said, ""I'm not sure. But when I was elected as a 29-year-old kid in 1972, before I was sworn in, I got a letter from a person named 'Biden'—last name—in Mumbai, from Mumbai."" And I said, ""But I never was able to follow up."" The next morning I had a press conference going away, and the Indian press said—someone spoke up and said, ""You have five Bidens in India."" [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And although I've never—we never admitted it, jokingly, that—I found out that there was a Captain George Biden, who was a captain in the East Indian Tea Company. That's hard for an Irishman to admit. [<i>Laughter</i>] I shouldn't be casual with you all because—I hope you understand the humor here.</p>, <p>But—and the end result was that I—he apparently stayed and married an Indian woman. And I've never been able to track it down. So the whole purpose of this meeting is for him to help me figure out who the Biden is. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But, all kidding aside, I think that the relationship between India and the United States—the largest democracies in the world—is destined to be stronger, closer, and tighter. And I think it can benefit the whole world.</p>, <p>And I think that's begun to come to pass. And today, we're launching a new chapter in the history of U.S.-Indian ties and taking on some of the toughest challenges we've faced together, starting with a shared commitment to ending the COVID pandemic.</p>, <p>The Prime Minister and I, we're going to be talking today about what more we can do to fight COVID-19, take on the climate challenges that the world face, and ensure stability in the Indo-Pacific, including with our own Quad partners.</p>, <p>Of course, our partnership is more than just what we do, it's about who we are. It's rooted in our shared responsibility to uphold democratic values, our joint commitment to diversity, and it's about family ties, including 4 million—4 million—Indian Americans who make the United States stronger every single day.</p>, <p>As the world celebrates Mahatma Gandhi's birthday next week, we're all reminded that his message of nonviolence, respect, tolerance matters today maybe more than it ever has.</p>, <p>And so I'm looking forward to my discussions with the Prime Minister. And thank you.</p>, <p>Mr. Prime Minister, the floor is yours.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Modi.</i> Thank you. First of all, Mr. President, I would like to express my gratitude for this very warm welcome full of friendship not only to me, but to my delegation.</p>, <p>Mr. President, in 2016—and even before that, in 2014—we had an opportunity to have discussions in detail. And at that time, Mr. President, you had laid out your vision for the relations between India and the United States, and you had enunciated that in great detail. And really, that was a vision that was inspirational. And today, Mr. President, as President, you are making all efforts and taking initiatives to implement that vision, and I warmly welcome that.</p>, <p>Mr. President, you have talked today—spoken in detail about the Biden surname in India. And in fact, you had mentioned that to me earlier too. Well, after you mentioned it to me, I hunted for documents. And today I have brought along some documents. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Maybe we'll be able to take this matter forward, and maybe those documents could be of use to you.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Are we related?</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Modi.</i> Yes. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Mr. President, I firmly believe that in our summit talks and summit meeting today, what I see is that this is the third decade of the 21st century. This is the first year of the third decade, and I see that, when I look at the entire decade, I find that under your leadership, the seeds have been sewn for the Indo-U.S. relations to expand. And for all democratic countries in the world, this is going to be a transformative period. I can see that very clearly.</p>, <p>And this is when I see that this transformative period is in Indo-U.S. relations. And when I talk about traditions, I'm talking about democratic traditions, democratic values, traditions to which both our countries are committed. And I find that importance of these traditions are—will only increase further.</p>, <p>In a similar vein, Mr. President, you mentioned the more than 4 million Indian Americans who are participating in the journey: the journey of progress of America. And when I look at the importance of this decade and the role that is going to be played by this talent of the Indian Americans, I find that this people-to-people talent will play a greater role, and Indian talent will be a full partner in this relationship. And I will—I see that your contribution is going to be very important in this.</p>, <p>Mr. President, in similar lines, the most important driving force in the world today will be that of technology and the technology that is going to be for the service and for the use of humanity. And I find that opportunities for this are going to be tremendous.</p>, <p>Similarly, Mr. President, between India and the United States, trade will continue to assume importance, and we find that the trade between our two countries are actually complementary. There are things that you have, and there are things that we have. And then, we, in fact, complement each other. And I find that, in the area of trade during this decade, that is also going to be tremendously important.</p>, <p>Mr. President, you just mentioned that on the 2nd of October, we will be celebrating the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. And Mahatma Gandhi always used to talk about the principle of trusteeship: trusteeship of the planet. And this decade, Mr. President, from that point of view, is also going to be important as this entire principle of trusteeship, it means that the planet that we have, we have to bequeath it to the following generations.</p>, <p>And this sentiment of trusteeship is going to assume more and more importance globally, but also between the relations between India and the United States. And it is these ideals that Mahatma Gandhi espoused when he talked about trusteeship of the planet and where the responsibility of global citizens is only going to go up.</p>, <p>Mr. President, you mentioned very important issues, and, after assuming charge as President of the United States, you have taken very unique initiatives, whether that be COVID-19, climate change, or even Quad. And in the days after that—after taking this initiative—you have made and deployed great efforts to bring them to implement your vision.</p>, <p>And also, today we have this opportunity to discuss all these issues in great detail, how—and after our discussions, we will look towards how we can work further together, not only for our respective countries, but for the entire world, how we can take positive action. And I am quite—I'm absolutely convinced that under your leadership, whatever we do, it will be extremely relevant for the entire world.</p>, <p>Once again, Mr. President, let me thank you profusely for this very warm welcome.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Modi.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Thank you, everyone.</p>]"
8,1,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-covid-19-response-and-national-vaccination-efforts-and-exchange-with-10,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good morning, everyone.</p>, <p>As I have said before, we have the tools to beat COVID-19 if we come together as a country and use the tools we have. Earlier this month, I laid out a six-part plan for the fall that does just that: One, vaccinate the unvaccinated, including with new requirements; two, keep vaccinated—keep the vaccinated protected; three, keep children safe and schools open; four, increase testing and masking; five, protect the economic—our economic recovery; and six, improve the care for people with COVID-19. Now, we've made important progress on each front.</p>, <p>And this week, as planned, we took a key step in protecting the vaccinated with booster shots, which our top Government doctors believe provides the highest level of protection available to date.</p>, <p>The Food and Drug Administration—the FDA—the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—they've completed their independent scientific review. And based on that review, the majority of Americans who were fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine are now able to receive the booster shot 6 months after they've received their second shot. Six months after you receive the second shot, you're eligible.</p>, <p>Those eligible include, in addition to meeting the requirement of 6 months after the second shot: those people that are 65 years old or older; adults 18 and over with certain underlying health conditions like diabetes and obesity; and those who are at increased risk of COVID-19 because of where they work or where they live, like health care workers, teachers, grocery store workers.</p>, <p>That's over—that group makes up 60 million Americans who are now eligible for a booster 6 months after their second shot. And up to 20 million who receive their—received their earlier Pfizer shot at least 6 months ago are eligible today. So those January, February—those folks are eligible now. Now.</p>, <p>And I've made clear all along: The decision of which booster shot to give, when to start the shot, and who will get them is left to the scientists and the doctors. That's what happened here. And while we waited and prepared, we brought enough—we bought enough booster shots, and States and pharmacies, doctor's offices, and community health centers have been preparing to get shots in arms—booster shots in arms—for a while.</p>, <p>And like your first and second shot, the booster shot is free and easily accessible. Booster shots will be available in 80,000 locations, including over 40,000 pharmacies nationwide.</p>, <p>So my message today is this: If you've got the Pfizer vaccine—if you got the Pfizer vaccine in January, February, or March of this year and you're over 65 years of age, go get the booster. Or if you're in a—have a medical condition like diabetes or you're a frontline worker, like a health care worker or a teacher, you can get a free booster now. I'll be getting my booster shot. I—it's hard to acknowledge I'm over 65, but I'll be getting my booster shot. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's a bear, isn't it? I tell you—acknowledge it. Anyway—but all kidding aside, I'll be getting my booster shot. I'm not sure exactly when I'm going to do it—as soon as I can get it done.</p>, <p>Of course, millions of Americans got the Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines. My message for you is this: You still have a high degree of protection. Our doctors and scientists are working day and night to analyze the data from those two organizations on whether and when you need a booster shot. And we'll provide updates for you as the process moves ahead.</p>, <p>Again, the bottom line is: If you're fully vaccinated, you're highly protected from severe illness even if you get COVID-19. In fact, recent data indicates there's only one confirmed positive case per 5,000 fully vaccinated Americans per day. You're as safe as possible. You're in good shape. And we're doing everything we can to keep it that way, which is where the booster comes in.</p>, <p>So let me be clear: Yes, we've made incredible progress in vaccinating Americans, with over 182 million people being fully vaccinated as of today.</p>, <p>But this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. And it's caused by the fact that, despite Americans having an unprecedented and successful vaccination program, despite the fact that for almost 5 months, free vaccines have been available in 80,000 locations, we still have—we still have—over 70 million Americans who have failed to get a single shot.</p>, <p>And to make matters worse, there are elected officials actively working to undermine with false information the fight against COVID-19. This is totally unacceptable.</p>, <p>The vast majority of Americans are doing the right thing. Three quarters of the eligible have gotten at least one shot, but one quarter has not gotten any. And in a country as large as ours, that's—25-percent minority can cause an awful lot of damage. And they are causing a lot of damage.</p>, <p>The unvaccinated overcrowd our hospitals, overrunning emergency rooms and intensive care units, leaving no room for someone with a heart attack or a cancer operation needed to get the lifesaving care because the places where they would get that care are crowded; they are not available.</p>, <p>The unvaccinated also put our economy at—recovery at risk, causing unease in the economy around the—and causing unease around the kitchen table. I can imagine what's going on in the conversations this morning and a lot of parents wondering what's going to happen. ""What's going to happen?"" Those who have been vaccinated—""what's going to happen?"" Potentially slowing economic growth, costing jobs.</p>, <p>Their refusal has cost all of us. The refusal to get vaccinated has cost all of us. And I'm moving forward with vaccination requirements wherever I can. These requirements will cover two-thirds of all workers in America.</p>, <p>And I'm pleased to see more businesses and organizations instituting their own vaccination requirements. I've had business leaders call me and thank me for setting the policies that would allow them to do the same thing. They are able to do it anyway, but it gives them the ability to move forward.</p>, <p>We're making progress. For example, United Airlines, which required vaccines about 7 weeks ago, now has 97 percent of their employees vaccinated. Just 4 weeks ago, the Department of Defense required vaccinations for the military, and already 92 percent—92 percent—of our Active Duty servicemembers are vaccinated. And we're on track to administer 24 million shots in arms in September.</p>, <p>So, please, do the right thing. Do the right thing. And I understand there's a lot of misinformation you've been fed out there, but try to look through—get to people you trust, the people who have been vaccinated. Ask them. Ask them.</p>, <p>So get vaccinated. But just don't take it from me. Listen to the voices of the unvaccinated Americans who are lying in hospital beds, taking their final breaths, saying—and literally, we've seen this on television—""If only I had gotten vaccinated. If only. If only.""</p>, <p>They're leaving behind husbands and wives, small children, people who adore them. People are dying and will die who don't have to die. It is not hyperbole to suggest it's literally a tragedy. Please don't let this become your tragedy. Get vaccinated. It can save your life. It can save the lives of those around you. You know, text your ZIP Code to 438829—438829—or visit vaccines.gov to find a vaccination location near you now.</p>, <p>Let me close with this: We also made so much progress during the past 8 months in this pandemic, and now we face a critical moment. We have the tools. We have the plan. We just have to finish the job together as one Nation. And I know we can. I know we can.</p>, <p>God bless you all. And please, look out for your own self-interest and health here. Get vaccinated. May God protect our troops.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>ABC, Rachel Scott.</p>, <p><i>U.S. Border Patrol Treatment of Haitian Migrants at the Southern Border in Del Rio, Texas </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you, Mr. President. You said on the campaign trail that you were going to restore the moral standing of the U.S., that you were going to immediately end Trump's assault on the dignity of the immigrant communities.</p>, <p>Given what we saw at the border this week, have you failed in that promise? And this is happening under your watch. Do you take responsibility for the chaos that's unfolding?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Of course I take responsibility. I'm President. But it was horrible what—to see, as you saw—to see people treated like they did: horses nearly running them over and people being strapped. It's outrageous.</p>, <p>I promise you, those people will pay. They will be—an investigation underway now, and there will be consequences. There will be consequences. It's an embarrassment. But beyond an embarrassment, it's dangerous; it's wrong. It sends the wrong message around the world. It sends the wrong message at home. It's simply not who we are. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Peter Alexander [NBC News].</p>, <p><i>The President's Campaign Promises/National Economy/Tax Relief/Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, thank you. You came into office on a message of competence and unity. We've witnessed what's happened in the country over the course of the last several months. We've seen the chaotic troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, the threat of a Government shutdown right now, and Democrats—members of your own party—are still divided over your agenda going forward. So what do you say to Americans who say that you have not delivered on that promise?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Remember, I said it's going to take me a year to deliver everything I'm looking at here. That's number one.</p>, <p>Number two, take a look at what I inherited when I came into office—when I came into office—the state of affairs, and where we were: We had 4 million people vaccinated. We had no plan. We had—I mean, I can go down the list. So, you know, part of it is dealing with the panoply of things that were landed on my plate. I'm not complaining; it's just a reality. It's a reality, number one.</p>, <p>Number two, I think a part of what has to happen here as well—for example, let's talk about my economic plan. The economic plan—and you all are always—and understandably, legitimately—citing polls. Every element of my economic plan is overwhelmingly popular—overwhelmingly popular.</p>, <p>But the problem is, with everything happening, not everybody knows what's in that plan. For example, all those women out there who are not able to go back to work because they have a dependent grandparent or a parent or they have a dependent child who needs help or they can't find daycare, or they can't find—afford—I mean, look at what's happening.</p>, <p>Well, there's a solution. There's a solution in the proposal that I put forward. And the plans we're now debating in the United—among ourselves and they're debating in Congress as—is a plan—the essence of the plan that I laid out at the beginning. And so I'm confident that, at the end of the day, we're going to be able to get that done.</p>, <p>Second point I'd like to make: We talk about price tags. The—it is zero price tag on the debt. We're paying—we're going to pay for everything we spend. So they say it's not—you know, people, understandably—""Well, you know, it started off at $6 trillion, now it's $3.5 trillion. Now it's—is it going to be 2.9? Is it""—it's going to be zero—zero. Because in the—in that plan that I put forward—and I said from the outset—I said, ""I'm running to change the dynamic of how the economy grows.""</p>, <p>I'm tired of trickle-down. The trillionaires and billionaires are doing very, very well—you all know it; you've all reported it—and in the middle of this crisis. But hard-working people and middle class people are getting hurt.</p>, <p>And so I provide for, for example, a tax cut. If you have a child, you get a refundable tax credit. It's reduced hunger in America by 40 percent, literally, for children. You have the whole notion of being able to provide for daycare for your children, getting people back to school, et cetera. It's all paid for. It's all paid for.</p>, <p>But a lot of these are flat tax cuts that exist within my proposal, and they're being calculated as if the cost of the childcare tax credit is a cost to the Government; it's not. It's reducing taxes—reducing taxes, not increasing taxes.</p>, <p>Now, part of the problem is, I had hoped—I hadn't planned on, although I kind of anticipated it might happen—I hadn't planned on the 178-mile top winds hurricanes going into Louisiana and 20 inches of rain in New York and New Jersey, and an area as big as the State of New Jersey burning down in the West.</p>, <p>And so what I had hoped I would be doing, I'd do what I did in the campaign: I'd be out making the case about what my plan proposed—contained. And it's been very much curtailed by a whole range of things.</p>, <p>And so I think that it's understandable—I think it's understandable—people being frustrated. I think they're frustrated as well by the fact that—not just Members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans—frustrated by, you know, ""I thought this was going to be better. I thought everything was working out."" We were moving along on COVID-19, and now we have all these people who refuse to get a shot. And now look at the people dying—large numbers of people dying.</p>, <p>So, I guess, I think it's a totally legitimate—obviously, it's a legitimate question you've asked—but I think, putting it into context here, it's going to take some time here.</p>, <p>And I know I always kid you when you all ask me about, ""Well, what about—are you going to get A done, B done, C done?"" ""Well,"" I say, ""Do you want to negotiate?"" I'm being a bit facetious, obviously, but here's the deal: This is going to end up—I believe, we're going to end up getting both pieces of my economic legislation.</p>, <p>The first piece—the 1.9—fundamentally changed the structure and the nature of the economy in this country, even though, remember, it got clobbered. It was this—""Oh, this terrible thing, no Republican voted for it."" Well, we got real economic growth.</p>, <p>Now it—we're at this stalemate at the moment. And we're going to have to get these two pieces of legislation passed. Both need to be passed. And they'll have a profound impact according to not just Joe—not Joe Biden, but according to Wall Street, according to the IMF, according to international organizations.</p>, <p>And so—and then there's, you know, I'm going to be having a meeting today with the Quad, with the leaders of—the leader of India, Japan, and Australia. And we're going to be talking about Afghanistan, which is a legitimate thing for people to talk about.</p>, <p>But the truth of the matter is, the end of the day is: We were spending $300 million a day for 20 years. There was no easy way to end that. And we're now still getting people out, but it's really—there was no picture-book way to say: ""Okay, the war has ended. Let's get everybody out, and we'll go home."" No war has ever ended that way, other than there's been a surrender, and it's a totally different circumstance.</p>, <p>So anyway, there's a lot, I'm sure, along the line that there are things I could have done better, but I make no apologies for my proposals, how I'm—how I'm proceeding, and why I think, by the end of the year, we're going to be in a very different place.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Vaccine Booster Shots </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, just to follow up on COVID, if I can, quickly——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Sure.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>What do you say to Americans who disregard the new CDC guidance and get a booster shot anyway?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I don't—I'm not sure how they get it, but——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>There are people who go into stores right now and just have got it without any high-risk situation or underneath that age limit; it happens around the country as we speak.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I think what's going to happen is, you're going to see that, in the near term—or we're probably going to open this up anyway. They're constantly looking at—we're looking at both Moderna and J&amp;J. And we're both—as I said in the speech—in addition to that, we're also looking to the time when we're going to be able to expand the booster shots, basically, across the board.</p>, <p>So I would just say: It'd be better to wait your turn in line, wait your—you know, in line—wait your turn and to get there.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you, sir.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Ken [Ken Thomas, Wall Street Journal].</p>, <p><i>Tax Code Reform/Budget Reconciliation Process/Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you, Mr. President. When you met with congressional leaders this week, you told them to try to find a number less than $3.5 trillion on the reconciliation package that they could live with. What is that topline number in your mind as you deliberate these considerations?</p>, <p>And then, separately, you mentioned how you're going to pay for some of these provisions. Senator Wyden has a proposal on annual taxes on billionaires' unrealized gains. Is that a proposal that you support?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, I do. I—look, I support a lot of these proposals. We don't need all the things I support to pay for this, but I do support that.</p>, <p>Look, you—if you get a—if you file with a W-2 form, you know, the IRS has access to your bank account and your bank tells you how much you made, what you have in there, and you know—and they estimate your tax.</p>, <p>Well, if you—if you have no income, you're just—it's all—if you have no earned income and it's all investment income, it's hard to figure out what the hell you—excuse me—what the heck you have.</p>, <p>And that's why we have to—and I know some people don't like this—that's why we have to rehire some IRS agents. And not to do anything, not to try to make people pay something they don't owe, just say: ""Hey, step up. Step up and pay like everybody else does.</p>, <p>Look, I really mean this. Look at my whole career—and I come from, you know, the corporate State of America. I just think it's about just paying your fair share, for Lord's sake.</p>, <p>Now, we can argue whether or not the corporate tax should go back up to 26½ percent or 28 or 24, but the idea that 50—50—major corporations in America, making a sum total of $40 billion pays zero? Come on. Come on. It's just wrong. It's just not fair. And I think it's beginning to, you know, sink through the ether a little bit here on the part of people.</p>, <p>So I think there clearly is enough from a panoply of options to pay for whatever it is that folks decide to pay for.</p>, <p>And let me finish by answering the initial part of your question, if I may. The way I look at it is—what I've been telling my colleagues; and it surprises them sometimes when we—in those rooms. And I don't know whether you heard, but both meetings went very well. I mean, it was—they were collegial. It wasn't—no one was hollering. Everybody was—you know. And people were hanging out afterwards in the Oval, and—anyway—both the progressives, as well as the moderates.</p>, <p>And one of the things that I think is important for—and I'm trying to get people to focus on is: What is it you like? What do you think we—no, don't—forget a number. What do you think we should be doing? Is it appropriate, in your view, to cut taxes for working class people by providing for daycare, providing for early education, 3 and 4 years old? Is it appropriate to do something about free community college, or do you want to means test it? I'm telling them, ""What are your priorities?""</p>, <p>And several of them, when they go through their priorities, it adds up to a number higher than they said they were for. Because I think this is—we're getting down to the—you know, the hard spot here. People are having now to go in and look in detail as to what it is specifically they're for.</p>, <p>It's a little bit like when we went through—and I'll end with this—it's a little bit like when we went through the issue of the bipartisan deal on infrastructure. There were a lot of negotiations on that. And it wasn't until people were forced to look at: What are you for? Are you for taking care of that highway or bridge in your State or that region—in your region? Are you for doing something about environmental degradation? Are you for something that deals with allowing us to provide for monies to States so that they can, in fact, deal with things like what happened in States where the major utility lines come down? What do we—what do you do to build those back better to prevent that from happening?</p>, <p>And it's sort of a—there's a—and you all speak to all these folks, so—you speak to as many as I do. I find that they're going: ""Huh, I never really thought that through before. I think it makes sense.""</p>, <p>And that's how we finally got to a bipartisan deal on what is a serious infrastructure proposal that really does a number of things, including—including—things where people said, ""I don't want to do anything in the environment,"" and then they start thinking: ""Well, wait a minute. I have all these diesel buses at home. It would be a hell lot better if we had electric buses. It wouldn't change the circumstance on boom, boom, boom.""</p>, <p>So I think this is a process. That's why I said at the front end that, although we got off to a very fast start with the first piece of legislation, I don't expect this to be done and us being in a position where we can look back and say, ""Okay, did we get it done?"" until basically the end of the year. I don't mean the vote on the two pieces of legislation related to the economy. But I think it's just going to take some time.</p>, <p>And look, you know, we're—my guess is, we all come from similar backgrounds. Remember you used to sit around the table—the kitchen table—in the morning, if you had the chance to do that, or dinner at night with your mom and dad and your brothers or sisters. What did people talk about? They talked about, you know, ""Are we going to be able to pay the mortgage?"" At least at my house.</p>, <p>I mean: ""What's going to happen if we have another one of those floods, and then, you know, it blows through here like it did in Queens? What's going to happen? What are we going to do?"" ""And by the way, I don't—you know, I'm just not sure that I want, you know, my son or daughter to—to be going into school when so many people are not vaccinated. I mean, you know, it's just—you know, I'm not sure I want Kenny to be there doing this.""</p>, <p>But these are practical things people are talking about. And they're looking down the road, and they're looking at cost-of-living issues as well. And so what's the cost-of-living issues?</p>, <p>Well, it's because we're in a position where the ability to have the product—the elements of the production of a product that, in fact, need to go into the production of that product, are hard to get hold on of, because people are in trouble. They're not able to produce them. They're not able to get it, or they're being hoarded. It's like, you know, what we have with—and we're making progress—but like what we're doing with regard to making sure we have the computer chips to be able to keep as—in the vernacular—to keep—you know, build automobiles.</p>, <p>I mean, I think, everybody was kind of surprised when I think if I had said to you—I may be dead wrong—but if I had said to you in, say, April that I was going to get all three major manufacturers of American automobiles saying they're going to go electric, I doubt whether you thought I—that could be done.</p>, <p>Well, we're out here in the back lawn; they've all of a sudden figured it out. They've had a bit of an epiphany. And they've realized: ""Whoa, wait a minute, man. China is investing billions of dollars. China is—they're getting battery technology. We're going to be—blah, blah. And this is going to happen anyway.""</p>, <p>And, again, I'll just conclude by saying: I—this is a process, and it's going to be up and down. That's why I don't look at the polls—[<i>laughter</i>]—not a joke—because it's going to go up, and it's going to go down. It's going to go up.</p>, <p>And hopefully, at the end of the day, I'll be able to deliver on what I said I would do: one, bringing the country together on a few and very important things, like on infrastructure; getting us in a position where we can have some coherent policy, relative to foreign policy, where there is agreement; moving us in a position where we're able to actually generate the kind of change in the dynamic of how we grow the economy: not eliminate the superwealthy, not at all, but allow the working class and the middle class to be able to build out and up. And that can be done.</p>, <p>And like I said, every time I hear—and I drive my staff crazy—every time I hear, ""This is going to cost A, B, C, or D,"" the truth is, based on the commitment that I made, it's going to cost nothing, because we're going to raise the revenue—raise the revenue—to pay for the things we're talking about.</p>, <p>And we're going to give and—right now, if you take a look at the—the reconciliation piece, a trillion dollars of that is tax cuts, not raising anybody's taxes; it's tax cuts. People are going to be paying less taxes.</p>, <p>But the people who pay less taxes are going to be working class folks. It's going to put women back to work. It's going to put people in situations where they have—as I know you're tired of me saying, but I'll never—my dad's constant refrain: Just give people a little breathing room—a little breathing room.</p>, <p>Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Thanks.</p>]"
8,2,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks at a Virtual Global COVID-19 Summit,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-virtual-global-covid-19-summit,"[<p>Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today.</p>, <p>As I said yesterday at the United Nations, nothing is more urgent than all of us working together to defeat COVID-19. And that world is going to be much better prepared for future pandemics. We have to do both.</p>, <p>This summit is about supercharging our efforts in three key areas: vaccinating the world by dramatically ramping up vaccine production, donations, delivery, and administering the vaccine, which is a logistical—it's a logistical challenge; addressing the oxygen crisis in many hospitals around the world, making other treatments more accessible, and increasing the availability of public health tools like masks and tests; and building back better so that our global health security infrastructure is more resilient than it is today.</p>, <p>We've all suffered. The United States has lost more than 670,000 of our fellow Americans. Worldwide, the death toll is above 4.5 million people—4.5 million people. And this is a global tragedy.</p>, <p>And we—we're not going to solve this crisis with half-measures or middle-of-the-road ambitions. We need to go big. And we need to do our part: governments, the private sector, civil society leaders, philanthropists. This is an all-hands-on-deck crisis.</p>, <p>And the good news is, we know how to beat this pandemic: vaccines, public health measures, and collective action.</p>, <p>During the first 8 months of my Presidency, we have worked aggressively to get Americans and the world vaccinated. As President of the United States, my first responsibility is to protect the American people. And I am proud that we have gone from 2 million Americans being fully vaccinated when I took office in January 20 to 182 million and counting, today, in America.</p>, <p>But we also know that to beat the pandemic here, we need to beat it everywhere. And I made and I'm keeping the promise that America will become the arsenal of vaccines as we were the arsenal for democracy during World War II.</p>, <p>We have already shipped nearly 160 million doses to 100 countries, more than every other country has donated combined. America's donations of a half a billion Pfizer vaccines through COVAX that I've announced before the G-7 summit in June have already begun to ship.</p>, <p>Today I'm announcing another historic commitment. The United States is buying another half billion doses of Pfizer to donate to low- and middle-income countries around the world. This is another half billion doses that will all be shipped by this time next year. And it brings our total commitment to—of donations—of donated vaccines to over 1.1 billion vaccines to be donated.</p>, <p>Put another way, for every one shot we've administered to date in America, we have now committed to do three shots to the rest of the world. I want to thank Pfizer and its CEO and chairman, Albert. Albert has been a good friend and had been helpful. They've been and continue to be partners and a leader in this fight.</p>, <p>And the United States is leading the world on vaccination donations. We need—as we're doing that, we need other high-income countries to deliver on their own ambitious vaccine donations and pledges.</p>, <p>That's why today we're launching the EU-U.S. vaccine partnership to work more closely together and with our partners—and expanding global vaccinations.</p>, <p>And as we do so, we should unite around the world on a few principles: that we commit to donating, not selling—donating, not selling—doses to low- and lower-income countries, and that the donations come with no political strings attached; and that we support COVAX as the main distributor for sharing WHO-approved vaccines; and that we fight vaccine disinformation and exercise transparency to build vital public trust in these lifesaving tools.</p>, <p>It's also important that we are working toward common goals and targets so that we can measure our progress and hold ourselves and each other accountable. Secretary of State Blinken will be convening Foreign Ministers later this year to check on our collective progress. And I propose that we come together for a second high-level virtual summit in the first quarter of 2022 to help gauge our progress and keep our efforts fully aligned.</p>, <p>Another goal is dramatically boosting global and regional vaccine manufacturing capacity, enhancing transparency so that vaccine production and distribution is predictable and coordinated.</p>, <p>In fact, an important part of the reason the United States is able to make these big, historic donations is because we've worked with U.S. vaccine manufacturers to accelerate the manufacturing rate and production. And now we're working quickly to scale up vaccine manufacturing in other countries around the world so they can manufacture as well.</p>, <p>We're working with partner nations, pharmaceutical companies, and other manufacturers to increase their own capacity and capability to produce and manufacture safe and highly effective vaccines in their own countries. For example, our Quad partnership with India, Japan, and Australia is on track to help produce at least 1 billion vaccine doses in India to boost the global supply by the end of 2022.</p>, <p>And we're providing financing and helping to strengthen manufacturing in South Africa and produce more than 500 million doses of J&amp;J in Africa, for Africa next year.</p>, <p>And next, we also know from experience that getting those vaccines into people's arms may be the hardest logistical challenge we've faced. That's why we need to significantly step up our investment in helping countries get shots in arms.</p>, <p>Today the United States is also announcing that we're providing an additional $370 million to support administering these shots and delivery globally. And we will be providing more than $380 million to assist in the global Vaccine Alliance—Gavi—to further facilitate vaccine distribution in regions in the greatest—with the greatest need.</p>, <p>And while vaccinating the world is the ultimate solution to COVID-19, we know that we have to act to save lives now. That's why the United States is providing nearly $1.4 billion to reduce COVID-19 deaths and mitigate transmission through bulk oxygen support, expanded testing, and strengthening health care systems and more.</p>, <p>And we're going to help all of us build back better by supporting the establishment of a financial mechanism for global health security—to simply state it, to prepare for the next pandemic, because there will be a next time. We all know that. Vice President Harris will be speaking more on this issue later today.</p>, <p>And finally, I want to acknowledge the leaders from the private sector, philanthropy, and civil society who are here today.</p>, <p>Governments can do a lot, but we cannot do everything on our own. We've asked our nongovernmental partners to take up the call for new actions that will solve the core challenge in making vaccines available to everyone, everywhere; solving the oxygen availability crisis; financing health security; and more. And I'm grateful—I'm grateful for their leadership.</p>, <p>And let me close by—with what I made clear yesterday at the U.N.: We can do this. This is within our capacity. We know what needs to be done. We just have to make the choice to do it.</p>, <p>Now, the leaders on the screen that I see here today, I know they've made that choice. And I think they know we can do this.</p>, <p>And I promise you, the United States will continue to lead. We'll continue to drive historic commitments in vaccine donations—1.1 billion and counting—so we can defeat COVID-19 together.</p>, <p>And we'll continue to invest in creating a future of true global health security for all people. That is a big, big goal I have—we have—we should have. And we're going to lead with the power of our example. And we're not going to stop. But the only way to get this done is for everyone, everywhere—is for all of us to step up, which I'm confident you will.</p>, <p>And now I'd like to turn this over to Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield of the United Nations. And I want to thank everybody on the screen I can see here, without going to each one of you, for all you've done, continue to do. And I think you all know, we can do this. We can do this. We have to do this. So thank you. Thank you all.</p>]"
8,3,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-prime-minister-boris-johnson-the-united-kingdom-and-exchange-1,"[<p><i>President Biden.</i> Well, it's a pleasure to welcome to the White House, the Oval Office, Prime Minister Johnson. I'm honored to have a chance to have him here, he—return a small amount of hospitality compared to all the hospitality he provided for the G-7 and our families and—in Cornwall. And since then, our countries have worked in close cooperation on a whole range of things, and our fellow democracies.</p>, <p>We continue to work on—we're going to talk about today—the ambitions we laid out at the G-7. And we're turning to our revitalized Atlantic Charter. We're going to make it something—we're going to turn it into real action so it makes a major—plays a major role in the challenges we face.</p>, <p>Earlier today I addressed the United Nations General Assembly, and I made clear that climate has to be the core area of action for all of us and—as we look ahead to the U.K.-hosted COP26, which I'm really anxious to attend in Glasgow in November, Mr. Prime Minister.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> Good. Fantastic.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> And we're promoting our——</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> We need you there. Yes.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Oh, we're going to be there.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> Fantastic.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> With bells on, as they say.</p>, <p>And we're going to also—our economies have to work together, including through our Build Back Better World initiative that we launched in Carbis—at Carbis Bay. And today we're going to discuss the next steps in all—on all of this, and as well as how the U.S. and U.K. can continue our cooperation in Afghanistan, in the Indo-Pacific, and around the world.</p>, <p>And I want to thank you again, Boris, for making the effort to be here. And I understand, Boris—I just want you to know, Boris—you came down on Amtrak, is that right?</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> I did. And you're a living deity——</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> I am.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson. </i>——on Amtrak, I can tell you.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> I've traveled millions of miles. You think I'm joking.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> They love you.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Well, they should. [<i>Laughter</i>] I traveled more on Amtrak than, I think—if I were a conductor, I'd be number one in seniority. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>I've got to tell you a quick story that has nothing to do with anything. When I was Vice President, the Secret Service didn't like me traveling on Amtrak because there were too many options for people to cause trouble along the way. But I insisted I do it.</p>, <p>And one day, they put in the newspaper: ""Biden travels one-million""—and I think—don't hold me to the exact number—I think it was—""three-hundred-and-fifty-thousand miles on Air Force Two.""</p>, <p>And so I was walking up to the—up to—getting the train on that Friday. And a guy, who was the number-three guy from New Jersey in seniority as a conductor, walked up and grabbed me, and he goes like this: ""Joey, baby!""—grabs my cheek. I thought the Secret Service was going to shoot him. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I said: ""No, no. He's a friend.""</p>, <p>He said, ""Joey, big deal. 1,300,000 miles on Amtrak""—I mean, on Air Force Two. ""Do you know how many miles you traveled on Amtrak?"" And I said, No."" He said, ""Well, at the retirement dinner, we worked it out."" He said, ""Thirty-six years in the Senate; x number of years as""—at that point—""as Vice President; average 131 days a year, 257 miles a day. Joey, you traveled over 2 million miles. Big deal."" [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>I thought they should name the railroad after me or something. But at any rate——</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> They named the station after you. They told me that.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Yes, they did do that.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> Yes, yes, yes—it's big news there.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Anyway.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> Joe, I want to thank you. And I share your belief in transport infrastructure, particularly trains.</p>, <p>I want to thank you very much for the warm welcome today. And it's great to be with you in the White House. And this is a very important trip for us in the U.K., and we've seen some great progress just in the last period.</p>, <p>And it's great that the ban has been lifted on British beef and the people of the United States of America can eat British beef.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> And we're going to be working on lamb too, so——</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> And the lamb. We're working on the lamb.</p>, <p>But what you did with the travel so that people can travel to the U.S. with two jabs is also fantastic and very welcome. We've been working on that for a long time.</p>, <p>But I think the most important thing today has been your speech, Joe, to UNGA, where you made a commitment on supporting the world to adapt to climate change, doubling the American commitment. That's very important for us.</p>, <p>And we've made a £11.6 billion commitment I made when I first became Prime Minister. But it's fantastic to see the United States really stepping up and showing a lead—a real, real lead.</p>, <p>And then, of course, there's the progress that we're making in the defense technology partnership that you've led and—with our Australian friends that I think has great potential to benefit the whole of the world and the security of the whole of the world.</p>, <p>So, Joe, thank you for having us. And I think, you know, we're boosting our shared agenda. We want to build back the world together with you. And I think we want to renew and strengthen our transatlantic bond. And it feels to me like it's going very, very well.</p>, <p>But I think—would it be okay if we just have a couple of questions? Just a couple of questions for the——</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Good luck.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> And I think we're going to be ruthless. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're going to be ruthless. I'm going to go to Harry Cole from The Sun.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Hey, he—ask him the question, not me. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, I'm joking.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> I'll take it.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, is Britain still at the back of the queue for a trade deal—a free trade deal, as your predecessor, President Obama, promised?</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> Well, I think he's asking a nice question.</p>, <p><i>British Teenager Killed in an Automobile Accident Involving a U.S. Citizen </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>And may I just ask, what possible justification is there for Anne Sacoolas not to be extradited to the United Kingdom to face justice over the death of Harry Dunn?</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Two things: One, that latter case is being worked on. I was under the impression—but I don't know this, I want to be clear—I was under the impression there had been a civil settlement reached, but I don't know that.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> That's correct. That's correct.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> And based on what I've been told, it was not an intentional act. It was someone who was new to driving on the ""wrong side of the road,"" quote, unquote.</p>, <p>And—but we're following—I'll follow up on that. I expressed my sympathies when it occurred, but I don't know the status of that case right now.</p>, <p>The other question was?<i> </i></p>, <p><i>U.K.-U.S. Trade Relations </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>A Brexit free trade deal with Britain. Is it——</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> A Brexit free trade—well, we're going to talk about trade a little bit today, and we're going to have to work that through.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> Let me just say, on that, Harry, I mean, don't forget, folks, that we've settled the Boeing Airbus thing, which was a massive problem between us. So we're making a lot of progress, and to say nothing of the beef and the whiskey, which I already mentioned.</p>, <p>And just to kind of say on——</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> He smiled when you said ""the whiskey."" [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> Well, he's a grade-A ambassador for them.</p>, <p>On the Harry Dunn case, which is a very, very sad—very sad case, and everybody's sympathies are with the family of Harry Dunn, I know that the President has been personally trying to move things along, and I'm grateful for that.</p>, <p>We're going to take one more question.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Prime Minister——</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> I'm going to go to Beth [Beth Rigby, Sky News]</p>, <p><i>U.K.-U.S. Trade Relations/Northern Ireland Peace Agreement </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you. President Biden, President Trump said that the U.K. was in front of the queue when it came to a trade deal. You seem to have a different approach. Is that because of your heritage, your concern about the Irish Protocol? Is that what's holding it back when it comes to doing this deal with the U.K.?</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> I—they're two separate issues. On the deal with the U.K., that's continuing to be discussed. But on the protocols, I feel very strongly about those.</p>, <p>We spent an enormous amount of time and effort in the United States. It was a major bipartisan effort made. And I would not at all like to see—nor, I might add, would many of my Republican colleagues like to see—a change in the Irish courts that—the end result having a closed border again.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> That is absolutely right. And I—on that point, Joe, you know, we are completely at one. And I think nobody wants to see anything that interrupts or unbalances the Belfast Good Friday Accord—that's the Belfast Good Friday Agreement. That's the—I think——</p>, <p><i>Haitian Migrants at the U.S. Southern Border in Del Rio, Texas </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>What's your response to the situation on the border, Mr. President?</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] Violence is not justified.</p>]"
8,4,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia in New York City,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-prime-minister-scott-morrison-australia-new-york-city,"[<p><i>President Biden.</i> Well, Scott, Mr. Prime Minister, it's great to have you here. It's good to see my friend, Prime Minister Morrison, and—today in New York. And I look forward to welcoming him to the White House on Friday, I guess, when the Quad meets, which will be a good in-person meeting.</p>, <p>The United States has no closer or more reliable ally than Australia. Our nations have stood together for a long, long time. And you can—we can rely on one another, and that's really a reassuring thing. We're grateful that our partnership has accomplished what we've accomplished together over 70 years.</p>, <p>We have a big agenda to discuss today, starting with our partnership to advance our vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific. And this conversation that we're going to continue with Japan, India—and India, on Friday, and—in the first in-person Quad leaders meeting—it's a historic event. And we're—I think we're all looking forward to it.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Morrison.</i> Very.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> The United States and Australia are working in lockstep on the challenges that I laid out today in my speech to the United Nations: ending COVID, addressing the climate crisis, defending democracy, shaping the rules of the road for the 21st century. Because I meant what I said: We are at an inflection point; things are changing. We either grasp the change and deal with it, or we're going to be left behind, all of us.</p>, <p>And so, I want to thank you again, Scott, for—it's great to see you. I look forward to working with you and all your team. And the floor is yours.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Morrison.</i> Well, thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for your warm welcome and to the entire delegation.</p>, <p>I think it's very important we're meeting here in New York. This month, we mark the 70th anniversary of the ANZUS alliance. There have been 14 Australian Prime Ministers since Sir Robert Menzies and 14 U.S. Presidents that have stewarded this great partnership.</p>, <p>The one time the ANZUS alliance was invoked was when the towers came down here in New York and were attacked. And that invoked the ANZUS alliance for the first and only time. And so, to both mark that event and remember all of those who were lost on that day, we reflect on, frankly, more than a hundred years of our partnership where we have stood together through the most difficult of times and the most prosperous of times.</p>, <p>And the United States and Australia have always shared a partnership that is about a world that—order that favors freedom, and that's why we've always stood together.</p>, <p>And in pursuing that freedom, it, of course, goes to our security interests. But more than that, it goes to global prosperity. It goes to global freedom, the freedom of our seas, the freedom of our region. It goes to addressing the great global challenges of climate change, a new energy economy, and a very, very challenging future, but one that our partnership, I have no doubt, will be able to address.</p>, <p>But it's not just about our partnership, because our partnership reaches out to so many others, whether it be our friends in the ASEAN nations or Europe or elsewhere, where we share so many like-minded interests.</p>, <p>And so, the issues we discuss in our partnership today really do reach out to so many others in terms of how we address the global challenges.</p>, <p>So, Mr. President, I want to thank you for your leadership and your focus on the Indo-Pacific region.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Right.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Morrison.</i> There's no doubt you get it.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> I think the last point you made is important. It goes well beyond just our partnership. Our partnership is in line with all the other democracies in the world.</p>, <p>And we've got a lot of work to do. So thank you all very much.</p>]"
8,5,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-united-nations-general-assembly-new-york-city-16,"[<p>Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, my fellow delegates, to all those who dedicate themselves to this noble mission of this institution: It's my honor to speak to you for the first time as President of the United States.</p>, <p>We meet this year in a moment of—intermingled with great pain and extraordinary possibility. We've lost so much to this devastating pandemic that continues to claim lives around the world and impact so much on our existence.</p>, <p>We're mourning more than 4.5 million people, people of every nation from every background. Each death is an individual heartbreak. But our shared grief is a poignant reminder that our collective future will hinge on our ability to recognize our common humanity and to act together.</p>, <p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is the clear and urgent choice that we face here at the dawning of what must be a decisive decade for our world—a decade that will quite literally determine our futures. As a global community, we're challenged by urgent and looming crises wherein lie enormous opportunities if—if—we can summon the will and resolve to seize these opportunities.</p>, <p>Will we work together to save lives, defeat COVID-19 everywhere, and take the necessary steps to prepare ourselves for the next pandemic? For there will be another one. Or will we fail to harness the tools at our disposal as the more virulent and dangerous variants take hold?</p>, <p>Will we meet the threat of challenging climate—the challenging climate we're all feeling already ravaging every part of our world with extreme weather? Or will we suffer the merciless march of ever-worsening droughts and floods, more intense fires and hurricanes, longer heatwaves and rising seas?</p>, <p>Will we affirm and uphold the human dignity and human rights under which nations in common cause, more than seven decades ago, formed this institution?</p>, <p>Will we apply and strengthen the core tenets of the international system, including the U.N. Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as we seek to shape the emergence of new technologies and deter new threats? Or will we allow these universal—those universal principles to be trampled and twisted in the pursuit of naked political power?</p>, <p>In my view, how we answer these questions in this moment—whether we choose to fight for our shared future or not—will reverberate for generations yet to come. Simply put: We stand, in my view, at an inflection point in history. And I'm here today to share with you how the United States intends to work with partners and allies to answer these questions and the commitment of my new administration to help lead the world toward a more peaceful, prosperous future for all people.</p>, <p>Instead of continuing to fight the wars of the past, we are fixing our eyes on devoting our resources to the challenges that hold the keys to our collective future: ending this pandemic; addressing the climate crisis; managing the shifts in global power dynamics; shaping the rules of the world on vital issues like trade, cyber, and emerging technologies; and facing the threat of terrorism as it stands today.</p>, <p>We've ended 20 years of conflict in Afghanistan. And as we close this period of relentless war, we're opening a new era of relentless diplomacy; of using the power of our development aid to invest in new ways of lifting people up around the world; of renewing and defending democracy; of proving that no matter how challenging or how complex the problems we're going to face, government by and for the people is still the best way to deliver for all of our people.</p>, <p>And as the United States turns our focus to the priorities and the regions of the world, like the Indo-Pacific, that are most consequential today and tomorrow, we'll do so with our allies and partners, through cooperation at multilateral institutions like the United Nations, to amplify our collective strength and speed, our progress toward dealing with these global challenges.</p>, <p>There's a fundamental truth of the 21st century within each of our own countries and as a global community that our own success is bound up in others succeeding as well. To deliver for our own people, we must also engage deeply with the rest of the world. To ensure that our own future, we must work together with other partners—our partners—toward a shared future. Our security, our prosperity, and our very freedoms are interconnected, in my view, as never before. And so I believe we must work together as never before.</p>, <p>Over the last 8 months, I have prioritized rebuilding our alliances, revitalizing our partnerships, and recognizing they're essential and central to America's enduring security and prosperity. We have reaffirmed our sacred NATO alliance to article 5 commitment. We're working with our allies toward a new strategic concept that will help our alliance better take on evolving threats of today and tomorrow.</p>, <p>We renewed our engagement with the European Union, a fundamental partner in tackling the full range of significant issues facing our world today. We elevated the Quad partnership among Australia, India, Japan, and the United States to take on challenges ranging from health security to climate to emerging technologies. We're engaging with regional institutions—from ASEAN to the African Union to the Organization of American States—to focus on people's urgent needs for better health and better economic outcomes.</p>, <p>We're back at the table in international forums, especially the United Nations, to focus attention and to spur global action on shared challenges. We are reengaged at the World Health Organization and working in close partnership with COVAX to deliver lifesaving vaccines around the world. We rejoined the Paris climate agreement, and we're running to retake a seat on the Human Rights Council next year at the U.N.</p>, <p>And as the United States seeks to rally the world to action, we will lead not just with the example of our power, but God willing, with the power of our example. Make no mistake: The United States will continue to defend ourselves, our allies, and our interests against attack, including terrorist threats, as we prepare to use force if any is necessary, but—to defend our vital U.S. national interests, including against ongoing and imminent threats. But the mission must be clear and achievable, undertaken with informed consent of the American people and, whenever possible, in partnership with our allies.</p>, <p>U.S. military power must be our tool of last resort, not our first, and it should not be used as an answer to every problem we see around the world. Indeed, today, many of our greatest concerns cannot be solved or even addressed through the force of arms. Bombs and bullets cannot defend against COVID-19 or its future variants. To fight this pandemic, we need a collective act of science and political will. We need to act now to get shots in arms as fast as possible and expand access to oxygen, tests, treatments to save lives around the world.</p>, <p>And for the future, we need to create a new mechanism to finance global health security that builds on our existing development assistance, and Global Health—and a Global Health Threat Council that is armed with the tools we need to monitor and identify emerging pandemics so that we can take immediate action.</p>, <p>Already, the United States has put more than $15 billion toward global COVID response—the global COVID response. We've shipped more than 160 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to other countries. This includes 130 million doses from our own supply and the first tranches of the half a billion doses of Pfizer vaccine we purchased to donate through COVAX.</p>, <p>Planes carrying vaccines from the United States have already landed in 100 countries, bringing people all over the world a little ""dose of hope,"" as one American nurse termed it to me, a ""dose of hope,"" direct from the American people and, importantly, no strings attached. And tomorrow, at the U.S.-hosted Global 19—COVID-19 Summit, I'll be announcing additional commitments as we seek to advance the fight against COVID-19 and hold ourselves accountable around specific targets on three key challenges: saving lives now, vaccinating the world, and building back better.</p>, <p>This year has also brought widespread death and devastation from the borderless climate crisis. The extreme weather events that we have seen in every part of the world—and you all know it and feel it—represent what the Secretary-General has rightly called ""code red for humanity."" And the scientists and experts are telling us that we're fast approaching a ""point of no return"" in the literal sense.</p>, <p>To keep within our reach the vital goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, every nation needs to bring their highest possible ambitions to the table when we meet in Glasgow for COP26 and then to have to keep raising our collective ambition over time.</p>, <p>In April, I announced the United States ambitious new goal under the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the United States by 50 to 52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, as we work toward achieving a clean energy economy with net-zero emissions by 2050. And my administration is working closely with our Congress to make critical investments in green infrastructure and electric vehicles that will help us lock in progress at home toward our climate goals.</p>, <p>And the best part is: Making these ambitious investments isn't just good climate policy, it's a chance for each of our countries to invest in ourselves and our own future. It's an enormous opportunity to create good-paying jobs for workers in each of our countries and to spur long-term economic growth that will improve the quality of life for all of our people. We also have to support the countries and people that will be hit hardest and that have the fewest resources to help them adapt. In April, I announced the United States will double our public international financing to help developing nations tackle the climate crisis. And today I'm proud to announce that we'll work with the Congress to double that number again, including for adaptation efforts.</p>, <p>This will make the United States a leader in public climate finance. And with our added support, together with increased private capital and other—from other donors, we'll be able to meet the goal of mobilizing $100 billion to support climate action in developing nations.</p>, <p>As we deal with these crises, we're also encountering a new era—an era of new technologies and possibilities that have the potential to release and reshape every aspect of human existence. And it's up to all of us to determine whether these technologies are a force to empower people or to deepen repression. As new technologies continue to evolve, we'll work together with our democratic partners to ensure that new advances in areas from biotechnology, to quantum computing, 5G, artificial intelligence, and more are used to lift people up, to solve problems, and advance human freedom, not to suppress dissent or target minority communities.</p>, <p>And the United States intends to make a profound investment in research and innovation, working with countries at all stages of economic development to develop new tools and technologies to help us tackle the challenges of this second quarter of the 21st century and beyond. We're hardening our critical infrastructure against cyber attacks, disrupting ransomware networks, and working to establish clear rules of the road for all nations as it relates to cyberspace. We reserve the right to respond decisively to cyber attacks that threaten our people, our allies, or our interests.</p>, <p>We will pursue new rules of global trade and economic growth that strive to level the playing field so that it's not artificially tipped in favor of any one country at the expense of others and every nation has a right and the opportunity to compete fairly.</p>, <p>We will strive to ensure that basic labor rights, environmental safeguards, and intellectual property are protected and that the benefits of globalization are shared broadly throughout all our societies.</p>, <p>We'll continue to uphold the longstanding rules and norms that have formed the guardrails of international engagement for decades that have been essential to the development of nations around the world, bedrock commitments like freedom of navigation, adherence to international laws and treaties, support for arms control measures that reduce the risk and enhance transparency.</p>, <p>Our approach is firmly grounded and fully consistent with the United Nations mission and the values we've agreed to when we drafted this Charter. These are commitments we all made and that we're all bound to uphold. And as we strive to deal with these urgent challenges, whether they're longstanding or newly emerging, we must also deal with one another. All the major powers of the world have a duty, in my view, to carefully manage their relationships so we do not tip from responsible competition to conflict.</p>, <p>The United States will compete—and we'll compete vigorously—and lead with our values and our strength. We'll stand up for our allies and our friends and oppose attempts by stronger countries to dominate weaker ones, whether through changes to territory by force, economic coercion, technical exploitation, or disinformation. But we're not seeking—I'll say it again—we are not seeking a new cold war or a world divided into rigid blocs. The United States is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to shared challenges, even if we have intense disagreements in other areas, because we'll all suffer the consequences of our failure if we do not come together to address the urgent threats like COVID-19 and climate change or enduring threats like nuclear proliferation.</p>, <p>The United States remains committed to preventing Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon. We are working with the P5-plus-1 to engage Iran diplomatically and seek a return to JCPOA. We're prepared to return to full compliance if Iran does the same.</p>, <p>Similarly, we seek serious and sustained diplomacy to pursue the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We seek concrete progress toward an available plan with tangible commitments that would increase stability on the Peninsula and in the region, as well as improve the lives of the people in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We must also remain vigilant to the threat of terror—that terrorism poses to all our nations, whether emanating from distant regions of the world or in our own backyards. We know the bitter string of terrorism—the bitter sting of terrorism is real, and we've almost all experienced it. Last month, we lost 13 American heroes and almost 200 innocent Afghan civilians in the heinous terrorist attack at the Kabul airport. Those who commit acts of terrorism against us will continue to find a determined enemy in the United States.</p>, <p>The world today is not the world of 2001, though, and the United States is not the same country we were when we were attacked on 9/11, 20 years ago. Today, we're better equipped to detect and prevent terrorist threats, and we are more resilient in our ability to repel them and to respond. We know how to build effective partnerships to dismantle terrorist networks by targeting their financing and support systems, countering their propaganda, preventing their travel, as well as disrupting imminent attacks. We'll meet terrorist threats that arise today and in the future with a full range of tools available to us, including working in cooperation with local partners so that we need not be so reliant on large-scale military deployments.</p>, <p>One of the most important ways we can effectively enhance security and reduce violence is by seeking to improve the lives of the people all over the world who see that their governments are not serving their needs. Corruption fuels inequality, siphons off a nation's resources, spreads across borders, and generates human suffering. It is nothing less than a national security threat in the 21st century. Around the world, we're increasingly seeing citizens demonstrate their discontent seeing the wealthy and well connected grow richer and richer, taking payoffs and bribes, operating above the law while the vast majority of the people struggle to find a job or put food on the table or to get their businesses off the ground or simply send their children to school.</p>, <p>People have taken to the streets in every region to demand that their governments address peoples' basic needs, give everyone a fair shot to succeed, and protect their God-given rights. And in that chorus of voices across languages and continents, we hear a common cry: a cry for dignity, simple dignity. As leaders, it is our duty to answer that call, not to silence it. The United States is committing to use—committed to using our resources and our international platform to support these voices, listen to them, partner with them to find ways to respond that advance human dignity around the world.</p>, <p>For example, there is an enormous need for infrastructure in developing countries, but infrastructure that is low quality or that feeds corruption or exacerbates environmental degradation may only end up contributing to greater challenges for countries over time. Done the right way, however, with transparent, sustainable investment in projects that respond to the country's needs and engage their local workers to maintain high labor and environmental standards, infrastructure can be a strong foundation that allows societies in low- and middle-income countries to grow and to prosper. That's the idea behind the Build Back Better World.</p>, <p>And together with the private sector and our G-7 partners, we aim to mobilize hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure investment. We also—we'll also continue to be the world's largest contributor to humanitarian assistance, bringing food, water, shelter, emergency health care, and other vital, lifesaving aid to millions of people in need. When the earthquake strikes, a typhoon rages, or a disaster anywhere in the world, the United States shows up. We'll be ready to help.</p>, <p>And at a time when nearly one in three people globally do not have access to adequate food—adequate food, just last year—the United States is committing to rallying our partners to address immediate malnutrition and to ensure that we can sustainably feed the world for the decades to come. To that end, the United States is making a $10 billion commitment to end hunger and invest in food systems at home and abroad.</p>, <p>Since 2000, the United States Government has provided more than $140 billion to advance health and strengthen health systems, and we will continue our leadership to drive these vital investments to make peoples' lives better every single day. Just give them a little breathing room.</p>, <p>And as we strive to make lives better, we must work with renewed purpose to end the conflicts that are driving so much pain and hurt around the world. We must redouble our diplomacy and commit to political negotiations, not violence, as the tool of first resort to manage tensions around the world.</p>, <p>We must seek a future of greater peace and security for all the people of the Middle East. The commitment of the United States to Israel's security is without question. And a support—our support for an independent, Jewish state is unequivocal. But I continue to believe that a two-state solution is the best way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish, democratic state living in peace alongside a viable, sovereign, and democratic Palestinian state. We're a long way from that goal at this moment, but we must never allow ourselves to give up on the possibility of progress.</p>, <p>We cannot give up on solving raging civil conflicts, including in Ethiopia and Yemen, where fighting between warring parties is driving famine, heroic—horrific violence, human rights violations against civilians, including the unconscionable use of rape as a weapon of war. We will continue to work with the international community to press for peace and bring an end to this suffering.</p>, <p>As we pursue diplomacy across the board, the United States will champion the democratic values that go to the very heart of who we are as a nation and a people: freedom, equality, opportunity, and a belief in the universal rights of all people. It's stamped into our DNA as a nation. And critically, it's stamped into the DNA of this institution: the United States [Nations].* We sometimes forget.</p>, <p>I quote the opening words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, quote: ""The equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world."" The founding ethos of the United Nations places the rights of individuals at the center of our system, and that clarity and vision must not be ignored or misinterpreted. The United States will do our part, but we will be more successful and more impactful if all of our nations are working toward the full mission to which we are called.</p>, <p>That's why more than a hundred nations united again—around a shared statement and the Security Council adopted a resolution outlining how we'll support the people of Afghanistan moving forward, laying out the expectations to which we will hold the Taliban when it comes to respecting universal human rights.</p>, <p>We all must advocate for women—the rights of women and girls to use their full talents to contribute economically, politically, and socially and pursue their dreams free of violence and intimidation—from Central America to the Middle East, to Africa, to Afghanistan—wherever it appears in the world.</p>, <p>We all must call out and condemn the targeting and oppression of racial, ethnic, and religious minorities when it occurs in—whether it occurs in Xinjiang or Northern Ethiopia or anywhere in the world. We all must defend the rights of LGBTQI individuals so they can live and love openly without fear, whether it's Chechnya or Cameroon or anywhere.</p>, <p>As we steer our nations toward this inflection point and work to meet today's fast-moving, cross-cutting challenges, let me be clear: I am not agnostic about the future we want for the world. The future will belong to those who embrace human dignity, not trample it. The future will belong to those who unleash the potential of their people, not those who stifle it. The future will belong to those who give their people the ability to breathe free, not those who seek to suffocate their people with an iron hand.</p>, <p>Authoritarianism—the authoritarianism of the world may seek to proclaim the end of the age of democracy, but they're wrong. The truth is: The democratic world is everywhere. It lives in the anticorruption activists, the human rights defenders, the journalists, the peace protesters on the frontlines of this struggle in Belarus, Burma, Syria, Cuba, Venezuela, and everywhere in between.</p>, <p>It lives in the brave women of Sudan who withstood violence and oppression to push a genocidal dictator from power and who keep working every day to defend their democratic progress.</p>, <p>It lives in the proud Moldovans who helped deliver a landslide victory for the forces of democracy, with a mandate to fight graft, to build a more inclusive economy.</p>, <p>It lives in the young people of Zambia who harnessed the power of their vote for the first time, turning out in record numbers to denounce corruption and chart a new path for their country.</p>, <p>And while no democracy is perfect—including the United States; we'll continue to struggle to live up to the highest ideals to heal our divisions, and we face down violence and insurrection—democracy remains the best tool we have to unleash our full human potential.</p>, <p>My fellow leaders, this is a moment where we must prove ourselves the equals of those who have come before us, who with vision and values and determined faith in our collective future built our United Nations, broke the cycle of war and destruction, and laid the foundations for more than seven decades of relative peace and growing global prosperity.</p>, <p>Now we must again come together to affirm, the inherent humanity that unites us is much greater than any outward divisions or disagreements.</p>, <p>We must choose to do more than we think we can do alone so that we accomplish what we must, together: ending this pandemic and making sure we're better prepared for the next one; staving off climactic climate change and increasing our resilience to the impacts we already are seeing; ensuring a future where technologies are a vital tool to solving human challenges and empowering human potential, not a source of greater strife and repression.</p>, <p>These are the challenges that we—will determine what the world looks like for our children and our grandchildren, and what they'll inherit. We can only meet them by looking to the future.</p>, <p>I stand here today, for the first time in 20 years, with the United States not at war. We've turned the page. All the unmatched strength, energy, commitment, will, and resources of our Nation are now fully and squarely focused on what's ahead of us, not what was behind.</p>, <p>I know this: As we look ahead, we will lead. We will lead on all the greatest challenges of our time, from COVID to climate, peace and security, human dignity and human rights. But we will not go it alone.</p>, <p>We will lead together with our allies and partners and in cooperation with all those who believe, as we do, that this is within our power to meet these challenges, to build a future that lifts all of our people and preserves this planet.</p>, <p>But none of this is inevitable; it's a choice. And I can tell you where America stands: We will choose to build a better future. We—you and I—we have the will and capacity to make it better.</p>, <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot afford to waste any more time. Let's get to work. Let's make our better future now. We can do this. It's within our power and capacity.</p>, <p>Thank you, and God bless you all.</p>]"
8,6,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Secretary-General António Manuel de Oliveira Guterres of the United Nations in New York City,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-secretary-general-antonio-manuel-de-oliveira-guterres-the,"[<p><i>President Biden.</i> Well, thank you, Mr. Secretary-General, for taking the time to meet with me as we launch this year's high-level week with the United Nations. It's a pleasure to meet with your key staff. And I want to thank you for your continued leadership of the United Nations through the pandemic, as well as navigating a whole raft of global crises and challenges.</p>, <p>The strong partnership between the United States and the U.N. is based on common values and principles. And at this moment, those bonds are more important than ever.</p>, <p>America is back. We believe in the United Nations and its value. Because of the challenge we face today in ending COVID-19 and dealing with the gravest threat to humanity we've ever seen, which is the whole climate crisis we're going—we're undergoing that can only be met with global solutions; no one country can, no ten countries can do it.</p>, <p>And the Secretary-General and I share a strong commitment to the principles of human freedom and human dignity on which the U.N. was founded. I went back and reread the Charter. I remember—we sometimes forget what the founding principles were—not you, but we—the world. Every U.N. member state likewise has an obligation to uphold those fundamental commitments and—that we've all made. The enormity of the task is already ahead for each one of us, and it's real. But the vision of the United Nations has never been short in ambition—any more than our Constitution. But the ambition matters.</p>, <p>Today, governments continue to work to—must continue to work together in a system built on international law to deliver equitable prosperity, peace, and security for everyone. And this is as valuable and necessary today as it was 76 years ago.</p>, <p>So I'm looking forward to speaking to the Assembly tomorrow—what a great honor that will be—and having our meeting today.</p>, <p>Thank you very much for this opportunity.</p>, <p><i>Secretary-General Guterres.</i> Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. And I have to say that I am delighted to have this opportunity to meet you, as you have clearly affirmed a strong commitment of the United States to the U.N. and to multilateralism, a multilateralism that we also want to see reformed, more effective, and more in line with the need to solve the dramatic problems of this world.</p>, <p>On the other hand, I'd like to say that the cooperation between the United States and the U.N. is a fundamental pillar for the work of the U.N. The United States, with its strong commitment to human rights; its strong commitment to peace and security in the world; its strong commitment to development, cooperation; and now, with your leadership, a very strong commitment on climate change, the United States represents a fundamental pillar of our activity.</p>, <p>And I'd like to reassure you, Mr. President, that we want to deepen that cooperation. We are extremely happy with the coordination we have with the Mission, with whom we work very, very well. And you can be absolutely sure that we share the same values, the same concerns, and the same commitment to the people of this world, especially to the most vulnerable and to those that have been more than dramatically impacted both by the COVID, the climate, and other challenges that we face together.</p>, <p>Thank you very much, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> I think we have a great opportunity to do a lot of good. Thank you.</p>]"
8,7,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks During a Major Economies Forum Videoconference on Energy and Climate,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-during-major-economies-forum-videoconference-energy-and-climate,"[<p>It's good to see you all. Good morning. Thank you, Secretary Blinken. And a special thanks to Special Envoy Kerry. John has been a friend for a long time, and I have absolute trust in his leadership on this issue.</p>, <p>We're honored to host all of you today as a follow-up to the Leaders Summit on Climate we hosted back in April. That summit made good on a commitment that I made to the American people that the United States would return immediately to the world stage and address the climate crisis.</p>, <p>I wanted to show that we're at an inflection point and that there's a real consensus—a real consensus—that while the climate crisis poses an existential threat, there is a silver lining. The climate crisis also presents real and incredible economic opportunities to create jobs and lift up the standard of living for people around the world.</p>, <p>And I want to thank you and your efforts so far that I—and I need to tell you the consequences of inaction. But you all actually know it. It's somewhat presumptuous for me to say this. But, over the last 2 weeks, I've traveled across the United States to see the damage and destruction from record hurricanes, record floods, and wildfires.</p>, <p>China continues across—excuse me—climate continues to change across Europe, Africa, and Latin America. And we've—and you've endured massive flooding. Fires have raged across Australia and the Amazon and the Russian tundra. In Siberia—this sounds—I found it almost unbelievable—temperatures reached 118 degrees—118 degrees—inside the Arctic Circle.</p>, <p>The finding from a new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change represents a code red for humanity. And the time to act is really narrowing, as the Secretary just pointed out, to get to—close to a point of no return. We don't have a lot of time. So we have to act, all of us. We have to act, and we have to act now.</p>, <p>When we met in April, we agreed to strengthen our efforts as we head to COP26 in Glasgow. Today I've called us together again to candidly assess our progress. I'm grateful to those of you who have strengthened your contributions under the Paris climate agreement and put forward ambitious targets for 2030.</p>, <p>And thanks to your leadership, countries representing more than half of the global GDP are committed to taking steps that will keep us within reach of our joint pursuit of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p>, <p>But we know there's still a lot of work to do, and if anything, our job has—in my view—has grown more urgent. The countries representing the Major Economies Forum account for 80 percent of global emissions. Without adequate commitments from every nation in this room, the goal of limiting and warming to 1.5 degrees slips through our hands. And that's a disaster.</p>, <p>And here's what I believe we have to do right now and what we're advancing here in the United States: We have to bring to Glasgow our highest possible ambitions. Those that have not yet done so, time is running out.</p>, <p>For our part, in America, I'm working to pass historic investment in—to modernize our climate-resilient infrastructure, to build a clean energy future that creates millions of jobs and ushers in new industries of the future.</p>, <p>As part of this work, the United States has committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions between 50 and 52 percent below 2005 levels by the year 2030. And you know, we've set a goal that by 2025 [2035]* our power sector will be with—free of carbon. And 2030, 50 percent of the cars sold in the United States, we believe, should be and must be electric vehicles.</p>, <p>A further step we're working with the European Union and other partners to launch is a Global Methane Pledge to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30 percent below 2020 levels by 2030. This will not only rapidly reduce the rate of global warming, but it will also produce a very valuable side benefit, like improving public health and agricultural output.</p>, <p>We're mobilizing support to help developing countries that join and pledge to do something significant—pledge and seize this virtual [vital]* opportunity.</p>, <p>You know, we've already taken big steps domestically to tackle these emissions and create good-paying jobs, introduced by plugging leaks and capping abandoned wells and gas wells. We believe the collective goal is both ambitious, but realistic. And we urge you to join us in announcing this pledge at COP26.</p>, <p>Now, you know, we also have to make additional progress to support developing countries.</p>, <p>At the time, at the Leaders Summit in April, I announced the United States is working to double our climate finance, triple our support for adaptation by 2024 for developing nations. And I can assure you that we're looking for ways to go even further toward meeting the collective goal of mobilizing $100 billion a year from the developing world and for them [for the developing world].*</p>, <p>The next—our emphasis this year is going to be on building the—building ambition on the road to Glasgow. Glasgow is not our final destination. Whatever commitments we make at COP26, we must all resolve together in Glasgow to continue strengthening our ambition and our actions next year and throughout the decisive decade to keep us at one point—below 1.5 degrees and to keep that within reach.</p>, <p>That's why this forum, I believe, is so important. And it was an important driver in the Paris climate agreement. You know, it was—we've got to continue to play a vital role going forward.</p>, <p>At this crucial juncture—to start—the start of a decisive decade—I'd like us to—I'd like to use this forum to forge a political momentum and consensus to drive concrete actions in four key spheres of energy, industry, land, the ocean.</p>, <p>And I want to be clear: This forum will complement, not substitute, for other forums. In fact, with respect to energy and industry, we will closely align our efforts with the work of the forums like the Clean Energy Ministerial and the Mission Innovation, both of which, I'm proud to say, the United States will chair next year. I plan to kick off these efforts by bringing together Ministers in January to discuss clean energy goals in power, transport, industry, building sector.</p>, <p>We also want to focus on ocean initiatives in advance of Our Ocean Conference in—next February. You know, I plan to convene a leaders-level gathering so we can take stock of the collective progress we've made.</p>, <p>In closing—and thank you for your patience—I want to again underscore both the urgency of this moment and the tremendous opportunity before us. I look forward to continuing this work—work together—and hearing how you plan to contribute to the climate ambition the world so urgently needs. The time is now. The time is now. And thank you for your indulgence.</p>, <p>I'm now going to turn this over to Special Envoy John Kerry, but thank you.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the meeting continued, and no transcript was provided.</i>]</p>]"
8,8,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the National Economy,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-economy-37,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good afternoon.</p>, <p>I want to start by thanking the House committees for working hard this week to advance critical components of the economic plan that I've put before the Congress. I know we still have a long way to go, but I'm confident the Congress will deliver to my desk both the bipartisan physical infrastructure plan and the Build Back Better plan that I have proposed.</p>, <p>As I've said many times before: I believe we're at an inflection point in this country, one of those moments where the decisions we're about to make can change—literally change—the trajectory of our Nation for years and possibly decades to come.</p>, <p>Each inflection point in this Nation's history represents a fundamental choice. I believe that America, at this moment, is facing such a choice. And the choice is this: Are we going to continue with an economy where the overwhelming share of the benefits go to big corporations and the very wealthy? Or are we going to take this moment right now to set this country on a new path, one that invests in this Nation; creates real, sustained economic growth; and that benefits everyone, including working people and middle class folks?</p>, <p>That's something we haven't realized in this country for decades. The data——</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President cleared his throat.</i>]</p>, <p>Excuse me. The data is absolutely clear. Over the past 40 years, the wealthy have gotten wealthier, too many corporations have lost their sense of responsibility to their workers, their communities, and the country.</p>, <p>Just look at the facts. CEOs used to make about 20 times the average worker in the company that they ran. Today, they make more than 350 times what the average worker in their corporation makes. Since the pandemic began, billionaires have seen their wealth go up by $1.8 trillion. That is, everyone who was a billionaire before the pandemic began, the total accumulated wealth beyond the billions they already had has gone up by $1.8 trillion. Simply not fair.</p>, <p>And it's—how is it possible that 55 of the largest corporations in this country paid zero dollars in Federal income taxes? They made over $40 billion in the year 2020, and they've paid zero. Think about that. Zero dollars in Federal taxes on $40 billion in profits.</p>, <p>How is it possible that the wealthiest billionaires in the country can entirely escape paying income tax on what they've made? How is it possible for millionaires and billionaires that can pay a lower rate of tax than teachers, firefighters, or law enforcement officers?</p>, <p>Here's the simple truth. For a long time, this economy has worked great for those at the very top, while ordinary, hard-working Americans—the people who built this country—have been basically cut out of the deal.</p>, <p>And I've said this from the time I announced I was going to run: I believe this is a moment of potentially great change. This is our moment to deal working people back into the economy. This is our moment to prove to the American people that their Government works for them, not just for the big corporations and those at the very top.</p>, <p>When I was sworn in as President, the Nation was struggling to pull out of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Job growth was anemic, with just over 60,000 new jobs per month in the 3 months before I was sworn in.</p>, <p>Then we went to work and passed the American Rescue Plan back in March. And it worked. It's still working. Over the last 3 months, we've been creating, on average, 750,000 new jobs per month. Our economy is growing at the fastest rate we've seen in nearly 40 years.</p>, <p>Our recovery is unique in the world. We're the only developed country in the world whose economy is now bigger than it was before the pandemic. While this is all good news, I know many Americans are still struggling to make it through each and every day.</p>, <p>For too many, it's harder and harder to pay the bills: food, gas, rent, health care. I get it. We still have a long way to go to get the economy where it needs to be. As I've said for a long time: Coming out of this economic crisis as deep as the one we were in was never going to be easy. But we're doing it, and we can continue to do it.</p>, <p>COVID, supply chain issues, bad actors seeking to profit off the pandemic are all contributing to the challenges we're facing. That's why I've made getting COVID under control my top priority from my first day as President. Everything—everything—from our public health to our economy, depends on this.</p>, <p>We've made enormous progress against the virus through the summer, and now we've put ourselves in a strong position to battle this Delta variant. That's why the actions I proposed on vaccines last week are so critical: from requiring Federal workers to get vaccinated; requiring health care workers to be vaccinated; requiring employers with over 100 employees to institute vaccine and/or test protocols, calling on—for them to be able to know what their employers—their employees are doing before they walk through the door; calling for vaccine or test requirements to enter big venues; and a whole series of steps I proposed to protect our kids in schools.</p>, <p>Wall Street firms have analyzed the impact of these plans, and they're projecting that these new requirements will help 12 million more Americans get vaccinated, which will help more businesses stay open and more Americans back to work.</p>, <p>The data shows that the overwhelming majority of Americans agree with my proposal. That's—there's no surprise, given that 76 percent of American adults have already gotten at least one shot. But we're facing a lot of pushback, especially from some of the Republican Governors. The Governors of Florida and Texas are doing everything they can to undermine the lifesaving requirements that I've proposed.</p>, <p>And some of the same Governors attacking me are in States with some the strictest vaccine mandates for children attending school in the entire country. For example, in Mississippi, children are required to be vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, hepatitis B, polio, tetanus, and more. These are State requirements.</p>, <p>But in the midst of a pandemic that has already taken over 660,000 lives, I propose a requirement for COVID vaccines, and the Governor of that State calls it, quote, a ""tyrannical-type move""? A tyrannical-type move? This is the worst kind of politics, because it's putting the lives of citizens of their States, especially children, at risk. And I refuse to give in to it.</p>, <p>These policies are what the science tells us we need to do. They're going to save lives. And they'll protect our economic recovery as well and allow the economy to continue to grow.</p>, <p>We're also going after the bad actors and pandemic profiteers in our economy. There's a lot of evidence that gas prices should be going down, but they haven't. We'll be taking a close look at that.</p>, <p>Taxpayers in this country also have paid for extraordinary effort to keep our country going over the past year or so. Unlike the last administration, which resisted oversight and allowed taxpayers to be victimized by fraud, we're working hard to protect vulnerable Americans from having their identities stolen—as a consequence of their unemployment check stolen as well. And we're going offer organized criminal—we're going to go after organized criminals that defraud America or misuse COVID funds.</p>, <p>Look, we're also taking a closer look at places in our economy where fewer and fewer corporate giants are controlling more and more of the marketplace in the area that they work. Just look at agriculture and the food industry. A very small number of giant corporations now dominate the market, which gives them the ability to drive up prices because they face so little competition.</p>, <p>As we work to build healthier competition in our economy and crack down on bad actors, the American Rescue Plan, which we passed in March, is still working to give hard-working Americans—hard-working people some relief.</p>, <p>One of the best examples of that relief is the expansion of the child tax credit, which, in effect, is essentially a historic tax cut for families with children. Just yesterday 39 million working moms and dads got their direct payment. That money is going to help cover groceries, the mortgage, new pairs of shoes—all the things that kids need. It's a tax cut for working families.</p>, <p>So we're working to provide as much relief as we can right now to American families. But here's the truth: Yes, the pandemic has caused a lot of economic problems in the country, but the fact is, our economy faced challenges long before this pandemic struck. Working people were struggling to make it long before the pandemic arrived.</p>, <p>Big corporations and the very wealthy were doing very well before the pandemic. That's why I've said—starting back in my campaign for President—that it's not enough just to build back; we have to build back better than before. And that's how it all begins.</p>, <p>Big corporations and the superwealthy have to start paying their fair share of taxes. It's long overdue. I'm not out to punish anyone. I'm a capitalist. If you can make a million or a billion dollars, that's great. God bless you. All I'm asking is, you pay your fair share. Pay your fair share just like middle class folks do. But that isn't happening now.</p>, <p>Today, in this country, right now, the top 1 percent, for example, evade an estimated $160 billion in taxes that they owe each year. Not new taxes, taxes that they owe.</p>, <p>And the way it works is this: If you're a typical American—like I suspect most of the press people sitting in front of me here—you pay your taxes. Why? Because you get a W-2 form. It comes in the mail every year.</p>, <p>The IRS gets that information as well. Your taxes get deducted from your paycheck, and you pay what is owed beyond that. That's why 99 percent of working people pay the taxes they owe.</p>, <p>But that's not how it works for people with tens of millions of dollars. They play by a different set of rules. And they're often not employees themselves, so the IRS can't see what they make and can't tell if they're cheating.</p>, <p>That's how many of the top 1 percent get away with paying virtually nothing. It's estimated by serious economists that that number is about $160 billion collectively owed each year that doesn't get paid. It's not an even playing field. My plan would help solve that. For example, it would give the IRS the resources it needs to keep up with the lawyers and accountants in the super—of the superwealthy.</p>, <p>It would ask just for two pieces of information from the banks of these folks: that amounts—the amounts that come into their bank accounts and what amounts go out of their bank accounts, so that the wealthy can no longer hide what they're making and they can finally begin to pay their fair share of what they owe.</p>, <p>That isn't about raising their taxes. It's about the superwealthy finally beginning to pay what they owe—what the existing Tax Code calls for—just like hard-working Americans do all over this country every tax day.</p>, <p>Look—and like I said just a few minutes ago—55 of the most profitable corporations in America paid zero in Federal income taxes on what amounted to $40 billion in profit. Not a penny. That's not right. And my economic plan will change that. Not punish anybody, just make them pay their fair share.</p>, <p>But my Republican friends in Congress don't want to change the law. So what are they doing? They're attacking me and my plan, which is fine. But if we're going to have a debate, let's have an honest debate.</p>, <p>My Republican friends are attacking my plan, saying it's ""big spending."" Let me remind you, these are the same folks who just 4 years ago passed the Trump tax cut totaling almost $2 trillion in tax cuts, a giant giveaway to the largest corporations and the top 1 percent. And listen to this: Almost none of that $2 trillion tax cut was paid for. It just ballooned the Federal deficit. In fact, the unpaid bills ranked up—racked up by the last administration are projected to increase the national debt by more than $8 trillion over time.</p>, <p>What I'm proposing is totally different from that approach for three reasons. First, my plan is paid for. It's fiscally responsible, because our investments are paid for that by making sure that corporations and the wealthy Americans pay their fair share.</p>, <p>Second, we're not going to raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000. That's a lot of money. Some of my liberal friends are saying it should be lower than that. But only corporations and people making over $400,000 a year are going to pay any additional tax.</p>, <p>And third, not only will no one making under $400,000 see their taxes go up, the middle class are going to going to get some tax cuts—some breaks. My plan benefits ordinary Americans, not those at the top who don't need the help. It's a historic middle class tax cut, cutting taxes for over 50 million families.</p>, <p>My Republican friends are making a different choice though. They'd rather protect the tax breaks of those at the very top than give tax breaks to working families. It's that simple. But let me ask you this: Where is it written that all the tax breaks in the American Tax Code go to corporations and the very top? I think it's enough. I'm tired of it.</p>, <p>For me, it's pretty simple: It's about time working people got the tax breaks in this country. That's what my plan does. And here's what it also does: By asking big corporations and the very wealthy to pay their fair share, it makes it possible to invest in America, to invest in the American people.</p>, <p>According to the leading economists—forecasters like Moody's and major international financial institutions—my plan will create—make us—create jobs, make us more competitive, and grow our economy and lessen, not increase, inflationary pressure. I don't know if it's been handed out today, but by the way, 15 Nobel laureates in economics released a letter yesterday arguing that exact same point.</p>, <p>They said, and I quote—and this is from 15 Nobel laureates in economics—quote, ""Because this agenda""—the one I'm talking about, mine—""Because this agenda invests in long-term economic capacity and will enhance the ability of more Americans to participate productively in the economy, it will ease long-term inflationary pressures."" It will ease it.</p>, <p>Let me highlight just a few provisions of my plan. I know this is long, and I apologize, but it's important, I think. My plan lowers the cost of daycare and childcare and eldercare for families and [has]* the added benefit of allowing millions of people, mostly women—who are not able to go back to work because of very young family members or elderly people they're taking care of—allow them to go back to work. It's estimated in the millions that can't go back.</p>, <p>It lowers health care premiums for millions of families. It lowers prescription drug costs by giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices. And it strengthens Medicare by adding dental, vision, and hearing coverage for—if you're on Medicare.</p>, <p>It also extends the tax cut for families with kids that we passed in the American Rescue Plan in March. All of this will mean thousands of dollars in savings for the average American family on some of the toughest and most important bills they have to pay every month.</p>, <p>My Republican friends talk a lot about inflation, but if you want to talk about actually lowering the cost of living for people in this country, my plan does just that. By strengthening the capacity of our economy, it will also reduce inflationary pressures over the long run.</p>, <p>Here's something else my plan does: It confronts the crisis of extreme weather events that we're seeing all around us and around the world—but just here in America. We see it everywhere. We know it's real.</p>, <p>In just the past few weeks—and there's more to come—I've seen the destruction of hurricanes in Louisiana, where winds got up to a hundred—gusts to 179 miles an hour; the deadly toll from flooding in New York, where 20 inches of rain, and New Jersey, more than 11 inches of rain in some areas.</p>, <p>More than 5 million acres of our lands and communities have burned to the ground in wildfires just this year alone. That's more than the size of the entire State of New Jersey burned to the ground. When I was out in California, I flew over some of these areas. In addition, there's a severe drought in the West and the Midwest.</p>, <p>There's a blinking code red out there for the Nation. We can't wait to act. Extreme weather, just last year, cost the American public $99 billion in damage—$99 billion in damage last year. And unfortunately, we're likely to break that record this year.</p>, <p>And the evidence is overwhelming that every dollar we invest in resilience saves $6 down the road, when the next fire doesn't spread as widely or the power station holds up against the storm. We need to rebuild with resilience in mind so roads are built higher, levees are built more—made more strong—stronger, transmission lines are better protected, and so much more.</p>, <p>You know, I hope we're past debating climate change in this country. Now we have to act, and we have to act fast. And my plan does that.</p>, <p>Let me end with this. This pandemic has been God-awful for so many reasons: the lost lives, as I said, over 660,000; the jobs, the businesses lost; the lost time in school for our kids. But it does present us with an opportunity: We can build an economy that gives working people a fair shot this time. We can restore some sanity and fairness to our Tax Code. We can make the investments that we know are long overdue in this Nation.</p>, <p>That's exactly what my bipartisan infrastructure plan does—I should say, our bipartisan infrastructure plan does: investments in roads, bridges, highways; clean water in every home and every school; universal broadband; quality, affordable places for families to live.</p>, <p>And we can invest in our people, giving our families a little help with their toughest expenses, like daycare, childcare, eldercare, prescription drugs, health care, preparing our young people to compete against any country in the world with preschool and community college.</p>, <p>We can confront this crisis of extreme weather and climate change and not only protect our communities, but create new opportunities, new industries, and new jobs. In short, this is an opportunity to be the Nation we know we can be, a nation where all of us—all of us, not just those at the top—are getting a share of the benefits of a growing economy in the years ahead.</p>, <p>Let's not squander this moment trying to preserve an economy that hasn't worked too well for Americans for a long time. Let's not look backward, just trying to rebuild what we had. Let's look forward, together, as one America, not to build back, but to build back better.</p>, <p>Thank you all very much. And God bless you all. May God protect our troops. Thank you.</p>, <p>[<i>Several reporters began asking questions at once.</i>]</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]—with Senator Manchin?</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]—President Macron, sir?</p>]"
8,9,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) Security Agreement With Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-australia-united-kingdom-united-states-aukus-security-agreement-with-prime,"[<p>[<i>Prime Minister Morrison spoke via videoconference from Canberra, Australia.</i>]</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Morrison.</i> Well, good morning from Australia. I'm very pleased to join two great friends of freedom and of Australia: Prime Minister Johnson and President Biden. Today we join our nations in a next-generation partnership built on a strong foundation of proven trust.</p>, <p>We have always seen the world through a similar lens. We have always believed in a world that favors freedom, that respects human dignity, the rule of law, the independence of sovereign states, and the peaceful fellowship of nations.</p>, <p>And while we've always looked to each other to do what we believe is right, we have never left at—each other. Always together, never alone.</p>, <p>Our world is becoming more complex, especially here in our region, the Indo-Pacific. This affects us all. The future of the Indo-Pacific will impact all our futures. To meet these challenges, to help deliver the security and stability our region needs, we must now take our partnership to a new level: a partnership that seeks to engage, not to exclude; to contribute, not take; and to enable and empower, not to control or coerce.</p>, <p>And so, friends, AUKUS is born, a new enhanced trilateral security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States; AUKUS, a partnership where our technology, our scientists, our industry, our defense forces are all working together to deliver a safer and more secure region that ultimately benefits all.</p>, <p>AUKUS will also enhance our contribution to our growing network of partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region: ANZUS; our ASEAN friends; our bilateral strategic partners, the Quad; Five Eyes countries; and of course, our dear Pacific family.</p>, <p>The first major initiative of AUKUS will be to deliver a nuclear-powered submarine fleet for Australia. Over the next 18 months, we will work together to seek to determine the best way forward to achieve this. This will include an intense examination of what we need to do to exercise our nuclear stewardship responsibilities here in Australia.</p>, <p>We intend to build these submarines in Adelaide, Australia, in close cooperation with the United Kingdom and the United States. But let me be clear: Australia is not seeking to acquire nuclear weapons or establish a civil nuclear capability. And we will continue to meet all our nuclear nonproliferation obligations.</p>, <p>Australia has a long history of defense cooperation with the United States and the United Kingdom. For more than a century, we have stood together for the course of peace and freedom, motivated by the beliefs we share, sustained by the bonds of friendship we have forged, enabled by the sacrifice of those who have gone before us, and inspired by our shared hope for those who will follow us.</p>, <p>And so today, friends, we recommit ourselves to this cause and a new AUKUS vision.</p>, <p>[<i>Prime Minister Johnson spoke via videoconference from London, United Kingdom.</i>]</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Johnson.</i> I'm delighted to join President Biden and Prime Minister Morrison to announce that the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States are creating a new trilateral defense partnership, known as AUKUS, with the aim of working hand in glove to preserve security and stability in the Indo-Pacific.</p>, <p>We're opening a new chapter in our friendship, and the first task of this partnership will be to help Australia acquire a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, emphasizing, of course, that the submarines in question will be powered by nuclear reactors, not armed with nuclear weapons. And our work will be fully in line with our nonproliferation obligations.</p>, <p>This will be one of the most complex and technically demanding projects in the world, lasting for decades and requiring the most advanced technology. It will draw on the expertise that the U.K. has acquired over generations, dating back to the launch of the Royal Navy's first nuclear submarine over 60 years ago; and together, with the other opportunities from AUKUS, creating hundreds of highly skilled jobs across the United Kingdom, including in Scotland, the north of England, and the Midlands, taking forward this Government's driving purpose of leveling up across the whole country.</p>, <p>We will have a new opportunity to reinforce Britain's place at the leading edge of science and technology, strengthening our national expertise. And perhaps most significantly, the U.K., Australia, and the U.S. will be joined even more closely together, reflecting the measure of trust between us, the depth of our friendship, and the enduring strength of our shared values of freedom and democracy.</p>, <p>Only a handful of countries possess nuclear-powered submarines, and it is a momentous decision for any nation to acquire this formidable capability and, perhaps, equally momentous, for any other state to come to its aid. But Australia is one of our oldest friends, a kindred nation and a fellow democracy, and a natural partner in this enterprise.</p>, <p>Now, the U.K. will embark on this project alongside our allies, making the world safer and generating jobs across our United Kingdom.</p>, <p>Thank you. Over to you, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Thank you, Boris. And I want to thank that fellow down under. Thank you very much, pal. Appreciate it, Mr. Prime Minister.</p>, <p>I'm honored today to be joined by two of America's closest allies—Australia and the United Kingdom—to launch a new phase of the trilateral security cooperation among our countries. As Prime Minister Morrison and Prime Minister Johnson said, I want to thank you for this partnership, your vision as we embark together on this strategic mission.</p>, <p>Although Australia, the U.K., and U.S. partnership—AUKUS—it sounds strange with all these acronyms, but it's a good one, AUKUS—our nations will update and enhance our shared ability to take on the threats of the 21st century just as we did in the 20th century: together.</p>, <p>Our nations and our brave fighting forces have stood shoulder to shoulder for literally more than 100 years: through the trench fighting in World War I, the island hopping of World War II, during the frigid winters in Korea, and the scorching heat of the Persian Gulf. The United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom have long been faithful and capable partners, and we're even closer today.</p>, <p>Today we're taking another historic step to deepen and formalize cooperation among all three of our nations because we all recognize the imperative of ensuring peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific over the long term.</p>, <p>We need to be able to address both the current strategic environment in the region and how it may evolve. Because the future of each of our nations—and indeed the world—depends on a free and open Indo-Pacific enduring and flourishing in the decades ahead.</p>, <p>This is about investing in our greatest source of strength—our alliances—and updating them to better meet the threats of today and tomorrow. It's about connecting America's existing allies and partners in new ways and amplifying our ability to collaborate, recognizing there is no regional divide separating the interests of our Atlantic and Pacific partners.</p>, <p>Indeed, this effort reflects a broader trend of key European countries playing an extremely important role in the Indo-Pacific. France, in particular, already has a substantial Indo-Pacific presence and is a key partner and ally in strengthening the security and prosperity of the region. The United States looks forward to working closely with France and other key countries as we go forward.</p>, <p>And finally, this initiative is about making sure that each of us has a modern capability—the most modern capabilities we need—to maneuver and defend against rapidly evolving threats.</p>, <p>AUKUS will bring together our sailors, our scientists, and our industries to maintain and expand our edge in military capabilities and critical technologies, such as cyber, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and undersea domains.</p>, <p>You know, as a key project under AUKUS, we are launching consultations with Australia's acquisition of conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines for its navy—conventionally armed. I want to be exceedingly clear about this: We're not talking about nuclear-armed submarines. These are conventionally armed submarines that are powered by nuclear reactors. This technology is proven, it's safe, and the United States and the U.K. have been operating nuclear-powered submarines for decades.</p>, <p>I have asked Secretary Austin and the Department of Defense to lead this effort for the U.S. Government in close collaboration with the Department of Energy and Department of State.</p>, <p>Our governments will now launch an 18-month consultation period to determine every element of this program—from workforce, to training requirements, to production timelines, to safeguards and nonproliferation measures, and to nuclear stewardship and safety—to ensure full compliance with each of our nation's commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>, <p>We'll all undertake this effort in a way that reflects the longstanding leadership in global nonproliferation and rigorous verification standards, in partnership and consultation with the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>, <p>So I want to thank the Prime Minister—Prime Minister Morrison and Prime Minister Johnson for their friendship, but mostly important for their leadership and partnership as we undertake this new phase of our security cooperation.</p>, <p>And the United States will also continue to work with ASEAN and the Quad, as was stated earlier; our five treaty allies and other close partners in the Indo-Pacific; as well as allies and partners in Europe and around the world to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific and build a future of peace, opportunity for all the people of the region.</p>, <p>We're joining together. Partnerships are getting stronger. This is what we're about. I want to thank you all. And I look forward to seeing both of you in person very soon, I hope.</p>, <p>Thank you. Thank you.</p>]"
9,0,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Business Leaders on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-business-leaders-the-covid-19-response-and-national-vaccination,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Well, folks, last week, I laid out a six-point plan for the fall to beat this pandemic, and it's based on what science tells us. And vaccination is key to getting the pandemic under control and keeping—and keeping—the economy strong.</p>, <p>And the first part of the plan is to vaccinate the unvaccinated. This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, not anything else right now. And the Labor Department is working on an emergency rule to require all employers with 100 or more workers to ensure their workers are fully vaccinated and regularly tested. And it's going to take a little bit for them to put those requirements in place under the law.</p>, <p>We're also going to require nearly all health workers—health care workers—to get vaccinated. In addition to that, if we seek—if you seek care at a health facility, it seems to me you should be certain the people that are treating you are vaccinated. And that's what we're doing, period.</p>, <p>And, in total, these vaccination requirements will cover a hundred million workers—two-thirds of all workers—and it builds on previous requirements that we've installed so far.</p>, <p>And the vaccine requirements work, and more companies are instituting them. Even at Fox News they require it. And I'm not being facetious when I say that. I'm—but it's interesting that they've stepped forward and done that as well.</p>, <p>And the group I'm meeting with here today is leading the way. We'll hear from the CEOs and presidents of Disney, Microsoft, Walgreens, Columbia Sportswear, Kaiser Permanente, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia—CHOP—which I've spent a lot of time, and Molly Moon's Ice Cream.</p>, <p>And we're joined by Josh Bolten, who is the—represents the Business Roundtable—which was a brainchild, I think, years and years and years ago out of Wilmington, Delaware, and the DuPont Company. And—but it represents over 200 major businesses who champion vaccine mandates to—and keep—and to make sure we keep businesses open and workers safe.</p>, <p>And also, we have Bill Tate. Since instituting the requirement, the Louisiana State University went from—a requirement that there be vaccinations—the vaccination rate at Louisiana State University went from 63 to 81 percent of the students vaccinated in weeks.</p>, <p>And it's about beating this virus, and it's about saving lives. That's what this is all about.</p>, <p>And here's what Wall Street has had to say recently. Goldman Sachs: Vaccinations will have a positive impact on employment. It means less spread of COVID, which will help people return to work. And Moody's: Vaccinations means fewer infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. And in turn, it means a stronger economy.</p>, <p>And I think everyone—thank everyone for joining me today, and I look forward to working together to beat this pandemic and keep our economy growing and going strong.</p>, <p>So thank you all for being here. And thank you.</p>, <p>Yes.</p>, <p><i>Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark A. Milley, USA </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Sir, did General Milley do the right thing, sir? In your opinion, did General Milley do the right thing?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I have great confidence in General Milley.</p>]"
9,1,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Flatirons Campus in Arvada, Colorado",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-renewable-energy-laboratory-flatirons-campus-arvada-colorado,"[<p>Thank you very much, Julian. I—Governor—and I want to thank you as well for all you do. You know, and the IBEW is the—one of the outfits, as they say in Claymont, Delaware, that ""brung me to the dance."" And they're the best in the world. And really great seeing you all working together.</p>, <p>Dr. Keller and the N-REL team, thanks for welcoming me here. And, Governor, it's good to see you again and your whole team.</p>, <p>Lieutenant Governor Primavera, Attorney General, Secretary of State. You know, you've got the mayor—Mayor Hancock. I think he's here, or he was here. I thought I saw him earlier today. I want to thank you for the welcome to Denver and for making the trip out here.</p>, <p>And to my friends in Congress—Chairman Baker—thank you for being here. My team—we have the Energy Secretary, Jennifer Granholm, who I always say, were she born in America and not Canada, she'd be standing here as President. [<i>Laughter</i>] But she's doing a heck of a job for me and for the country. And a proud electric car driver as well.</p>, <p>And also, a former Secretary and former mayor of Denver, Federico Peña, a good friend of mine who's here today. There you go, Fred. Good to see you, pal.</p>, <p>And while he couldn't be here, I wanted to mention that the Senator and our—my nominee for Ambassador to Mexico is Ken Salazar. And I'm glad to see Congressmen Perlmutter and Neguse and Crow. I want to thank you all. You have other places to be, I know.</p>, <p>And three good friends who wanted to be here are in Washington today, right now. And so—you know, there's a lot: Senator Bennet and Hickenlooper and Congresswoman DeGette. They're all in Washington doing what they have to do.</p>, <p>When you look—we look at who you've heard from, it's clear: Whether you're an engineer or on a—at a lab bench, the IB—or an IBEW worker working on a combine—a tribune—a turbine, when you work for a power company or a small construction business, everyone—everyone—has a role to play and everyone is building a clean energy future and a stronger economy. Because that's what this is about. And we need everyone's contributions. We need everyone's contributions.</p>, <p>Yesterday I saw firsthand the devastation of the Caldor Fire in California as we flew over it in a helicopter. And in the last 2 weeks, I traveled to Louisiana, New York, and New Jersey to see the destruction from Hurricane Ida. More people killed in New York with flooding, 20 inches of rain—and what's happened up there—than were killed when 178-mile-an-hour winds hit Louisiana.</p>, <p>The extreme weather is—we're seeing is only going to come more frequently and with more ferocity. And we're blinking code red as a nation, and we really are. So far this year, nationwide, there are 44,000 wildfires that have burned nearly 5.6 million acres. That's enough—that's the size of the entire State of New Jersey burned flat. They've caused billions of dollars in damage and forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate their homes and businesses.</p>, <p>And even if it's not in your backyard, you feel the effects, as you mentioned earlier. You turn on the local weather—in addition to telling you what the temperature is and what the precipitation will be, you want to know what the smoke forecast is going to be. When parents fear letting their kids play out to play, that, outside, it may trigger an asthma attack.</p>, <p>You saw the vicious cycle this summer when heavy rains combined—combined with the burn scar of 2020 Grizzly Creek Fire, it resulted in mudslides, as we've pointed out, that washed out an entire section of Interstate 70, adding hours of people's drives and cutting off a vital commercial artery.</p>, <p>The bottom line is, it's everywhere. It's everywhere. Communities that nearly 1 in 3 Americans call home have been struck by weather disasters in just the past few months. Hurricanes in the Gulf Coast are up to the—and up the Eastern Seaboard. Wildfires threatening throughout the West and tearing it apart. Droughts and heat waves across the country, devastating farmers and ranchers and draining the Colorado River.</p>, <p>In addition to the lost lives—lives shattered, extreme weather cost America, last year, $99 billion; $99 billion extreme weather cost last year. And it's going to break the record this year. It's going to be well over $100 billion.</p>, <p>We know what the driver is: climate change. And we know what's causing climate change: human activity. This is no longer subject to debate. And, I might add, windmills do not cause cancer. [<i>Laughter</i>] You know, look, we've got to get real about what's going on. I really mean it. Think about it.</p>, <p>The only debate is around what we do to confront this crisis, and that shouldn't even be a debate. You know, we have to invest in being more resilient because of the impacts of climate—the climate change that's occurring today, not next year, not 10 years from now. And we have to make the investments that are going to slow our contributions to climate change today, not tomorrow.</p>, <p>And here's the good news: Something that is caused by humans can be solved by humans. I've set a course for the United States to achieve 50- to 52-percent reduction in greenhouse emissions by 2030 and for us to reach that net-zero emissions in the economy—all—economy-wide, across the board—by 2050.</p>, <p>As part of that, I set a goal of having our country produce 100-percent carbon pollution-free power by 2035. We can do that. We can do all of this in a way that creates good jobs, lowers costs to consumers and businesses, and makes us global leaders in an entirely new industry that other countries are really working hard to try to dominate.</p>, <p>I just toured the Renewable Energy Lab, which I hadn't been here—not the same lab—but I hadn't been here since 2011. Which was started under President Carter and expanded under President Bush—H.W. Bush. Leaders of both parties have recognized that clean energy future and economic—is an economic imperative and a national security imperative and an environmental imperative.</p>, <p>That's why my Build Back Better plan calls for significant new investments in upgrading research infrastructures, laboratories all across the country. We'll be making one of those breakthroughs in solar, wind, and storage on—out of these facilities—out-innovate the rest of the world and drive down the costs of renewable energy. Of course, we have to invest in the future. We need to deploy cutting-edge technologies, and we have to deploy them today, not tomorrow.</p>, <p>I had a chance to see the state-of-the-art wind turbine testing and new battery technologies. Because of the years of work that have taken place here—and these technologies aren't science fiction—they're ready to be installed and scaled up across the country, right now, by union members like the ones we heard from today. And that's what we're going to do.</p>, <p>You know, as we just heard from the CEO of Xcel Energy, they've set a goal of producing 100 percent carbon emission-free power. They're the first major utility—the first major utility—to set that goal. And today, over 20 large facilities around the Nation have set a similar goal. You've led the way.</p>, <p>Today, one of every three Americans lives in a city or a State transitioning to clean energy—clean energy electricity. But, folks, we have to pick up the pace. When I rejoined the Paris climate accord after we had been pulled out of it, the goals set when our administration—the last administration, the Obama-Biden administration—when that was set, they were—said that we had more time. We don't have time now. The goals are different because the necessity is there. We don't have a lot of time. We don't have much more than 10 years. For real. And this is a decisive decade.</p>, <p>Already, the price of solar generation in this country has dropped 80 percent over the past decade. Eighty percent. The price of wind turbine generation has dropped 55 percent. And a lot of it is because of the investments we made in the Recovery Act, back when I was Vice President. And today, renewables are now cheaper than fossil fuels in many parts of the country.</p>, <p>Now we need to take the next step of continuing to drive prices down and job creation up, because those renewable goals create demand for more wind turbines and more installations—solar installations, which means good jobs for workers like Julian and his union brothers and sisters. And you can see why I think that climate change, when I think of it, I think jobs.</p>, <p>I had a meeting with over 140 heads of state on the Zoom when we hosted it out of the White House. And one of the things—by the time I finished, everyone was talking about jobs. It's not about costing jobs.</p>, <p>Initially, as you remember—even you guys—I spent a lot of time, before I announced my plan, meeting with all the unions to convince you all that this is the future; these are where the jobs are. When I say ""jobs,"" I'm not talking about $15 an hour. I'm not talking—am I not speaking loudly enough? I can see you're having trouble hearing me back there. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>You know, I'm talking about union jobs—not 15, 20 bucks an hour; 45, 50 bucks an hour. Benefits. That's going to grow the country too. I've never seen the wealthy do poorly when the middle class does well. That's never happened.</p>, <p>So, to accelerate that progress, we need invest and innovate. We need a modern electric grid—one that has much higher capacity and more resilient transmission wires; and—you know, and with—has more storage capacity, using advanced batteries so we can hold on to surplus energy generated when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing.</p>, <p>Right now it's going to rain—no. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right now we've got transmission projects that could carry enough power for millions of homes, but they need catalytic investment to move to the construction phase.</p>, <p>Our bipartisan infrastructure bill contains the largest Federal investment in power transmission in our history so that our grid is more reliable, we can carry more renewable energy, so we can create good union jobs building that new grid. We're also making dramatic investments in public transit, electric buses, charging stations.</p>, <p>In Denver, we're going to help Mayor Hancock achieve his goal of reducing greenhouse gases in the city by 80 percent. It's going to create jobs that we know the Local 68 apprentice center is busy training workers to be able to perform.</p>, <p>And by the way, I'm bringing the automakers, including the Big Three and the UAW, along so we have more electric vehicles on the road and fewer tailpipe emissions in the air.</p>, <p>We're going to cap thousands—[<i>applause</i>]—we're going to cap thousands of abandoned oil wells and gas wells leaking methane, threatening public health in communities, and get paid the same price for capping them as it was to dig them.</p>, <p>We're going to provide support to make our communities, including Tribal nations, much more resilient to the impacts of climate change.</p>, <p>Every dollar we invest to flood-proof a power station, install power lines underground, ""winterize"" a power plant, or to build advanced turbines, like the ones here—every dollar we spend saves $6 down the road, because the next time a disaster strikes, flooding is contained, the fire doesn't spread as widely, the power stays on.</p>, <p>And these investments can also save lives, save homes, and create good-paying jobs for Americans to make our country stronger and more resilient.</p>, <p>In fact, experts tell us that the bipartisan agreement we've reached in the American infrastructure bill will put 800,000 people to work—800,000—including plumbers, pipefitters, electrical workers, steel workers—modernizing roads, bridges, water systems, broadband systems; making high-speed internet available to 85,000 Coloradans who currently don't have it. That's what's in the infrastructure bill that's already agreed to.</p>, <p>And we're negotiating right now for my plan to build back better, which includes additional action to address climate crisis. It includes tax credits that will effectively cut the cost of building a utility-scale solar farms by 30 percent; shorten the time it takes for resident-scale—residential-scale solar systems to pay for themselves in around 8 years—and instead of 8, less than 5 years; save consumers 1,250 [12,500]* bucks for an electric vehicle, like a Ford F-150. By the way, 0 to 60 in 4.1. That's a different—[<i>laughter</i>]. Help us reach the goal of half of new cars sold in America will be electric by 2030, saving billions of gallons of gasoline.</p>, <p>And I want to see—I want to create a Civilian Climate Corps—I've been pushing that for a long time—similar to the Conservation Corps that President Roosevelt created during the Great Depression, put a new generation of Americans to work, helping us connect and conserve our public lands and become resilient in the process.</p>, <p>Yesterday I visited the National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho where we coordinate our Federal fire response to wildfires. They told me that the climate—the Civilian Climate Corps would make an enormous difference by cleaning away combustible underbrush enable fires—that enable fires to spread, by planting trees to fight climate change.</p>, <p>In the end, it's not about red States or blue States. A drought or a fire doesn't see a property line. It doesn't care—give a damn for which party you belong to. Disasters aren't going to stop. That's the nature of the climate threat. But we know—we know—what we have to do. We just need to summon the courage and the creativity to do it.</p>, <p>Yes, we face a crisis, but we face a crisis with an unprecedented opportunity to create good jobs of the future, to create industries of the future, to win the future, to save the planet. Ladies and gentlemen, we can do this. This is the United States of America. There has never been a problem we faced when we set our mind to deal with it, we haven't been able to—I mean it literally. Never have we failed to meet an objective we set.</p>, <p>And what's happening now with both the industry, government, unions, people around the country is that we've set a goal, and the goal is achievable.</p>, <p>And I promise you—I promise you—it's going to create great economic growth, reduce inflation, and put people in a place where those beautiful children in the back are never going to have to worry about what we're worrying about right now.</p>, <p>So thank you. Remember, there's not a damn thing we're unable to do in America when we put our—when we come together. Never, ever have we failed. And we're not going to fail now, because of all of you.</p>, <p>Thank you for everything. Thanks, everybody. I really mean it. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Appreciate it.</p>]"

It's good to be back.</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Joe! Joe! Joe!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Well, I'll tell you what——</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Joe! Joe! Joe!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Thank you. You all have been standing a long time.</p>, <p>And I tell you what, you know, the Governor and I have a lot in common: We both married way up. [<i>Laughter</i>] Jennifer, thank you for the welcome. Thank you for what you do. And thank you for becoming friends with Jill. I'm Jill's husband, Joe Biden.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And, folks——</p>, <p><i>Audience member.</i> That's my President! I love you, Joe!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Mayor—[<i>laughter</i>]—Mayor Garcia, it's good to be back in your town. Last time out here, we were talking about infrastructure. Now we've got a lot of money coming this way.</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yeah!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> We've got a lot working. We've got an infrastructure bill that we passed. And we're going to do an awful lot more to build this incredible, incredible economy.</p>, <p>You know, someone was saying to me earlier today: the most diverse State in the Nation. Matter of fact, I think it was your Senator. The most diverse State in the Nation. The most different State in the Nation. The biggest State in the Nation. And has the—one of the largest economies in the world. And no one sees any inconsistency there. It's because we're diverse you have the largest economy in the world.</p>, <p>Senator Padilla, thank you for your leadership in the United States Senate. You're doing an incredible job.</p>, <p>And I know she was here last week, but I've got to give a shout-out to my favorite daughter of California who's always taking—talking about you all—talks about you all the time, like I talk about Delaware. She loves you. Matter of fact, she thinks you're the only State in the Nation. [<i>Laughter</i>] Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>, <p>And of course, the reason I'm here and you all are here is to thank and support our friend, Governor Gavin Newsom, one of the best Governors in the country.</p>, <p>California, I'm not sure you know it, but if you didn't know it, you should: The eyes of the Nation—this is not hyperbole—the eyes of the Nation are on California. Because the decision you're about to make isn't just going to have a—isn't just going to have a huge impact on California. It's going to reverberate around the Nation and, quite frankly—not a joke—around the world.</p>, <p>And here's why: All of you know that last year I got to run against the real Donald Trump.</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, this year—this year, the leading Republican running for Governor is a—the closest thing to a Trump clone that I've ever seen in your State. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, I really mean it. And he's leading the other team. He's the clone of Donald Trump. Can you imagine him being Governor of this State?</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> No!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> You can't let that happen. There's too much at stake.</p>, <p>And here is why it's so important for you all to vote ""no"" on a recall: First, voting no will be protecting California from Trump Republicans trying to block us from beating this pandemic. COVID-19: Gavin Newsom has had the courage to lead, stand up for science. For the very thing he's been one of the leading Governors in the Nation, protecting his people and vaccinating his State.</p>, <p>Meanwhile—meanwhile, we see something else in parts of America. Right now there are certain Republican Governors, like the Governor of Mississippi, who are talking to me about being dictatorial about demanding that people get vaccinated or tested. People are doing everything they can to block or undermine the lifesaving mandates we proposed: putting their people at risk, putting their children at risk, putting their States at risk.</p>, <p>And here's the worst thing: For these Republican Governors, it isn't about public health, about the health of the people; it's about politics. Look, folks, just look at the hypocrisy: The same Governors who are attacking me and your Governor for COVID-19 mandates are in a—States with some of the strictest vaccine mandates for children attending school in the whole country.</p>, <p>Talk about inconsistency: In Mississippi, children are required to be vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, hepatitis B, polio, tetanus, and more. It's a State requirement. But now, in the midst of this pandemic that has taken over 650,000 lives, I propose a mandate for COVID-19 vaccines, and it's an ""outrage""; it's an ""infringement on freedom.""</p>, <p>Look, folks, we don't need politics in this battle against COVID. We need science. We need courage. We need leadership. We need Gavin Newsom, a Governor who follows science, who's got the courage to do what's right and who'll lead.</p>, <p>[<i>The President coughed.</i>]</p>, <p>And I apologize for coughing.</p>, <p><i>Audience member.</i> Five more years, Gavin!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Last week, I laid out a six-part plan for the fall to beat this pandemic. First, vaccinate the unvaccinated with new vaccine requirements. Two, protect the vaccinated. Three, keep children safe in school. And four, increase testing and masking. And keep our economy going strong. And take care of people with COVID-19. That's what the science tells us. We have to beat the Delta variant of COVID-19.</p>, <p>Gavin will be a Governor who will help us finish the job. Folks, send a message to the Nation: Courage matters. Leadership matters. Science matters. Vote to keep Gavin. Get vaccinated to save lives.</p>, <p>Second, by voting no, you'll be keeping a Governor who respects women instead of someone who wrote that women know less about politics and economics than men.</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> He hasn't met my wife. [<i>Laughter</i>] Look, if you have any doubt about how important it is to have Gavin, who respects women's right to—just take a look at what's happening in States like Texas. They just passed a law empowering complete strangers to become bounty hunters, going after women who exercise their right to choose.</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> A law the United States Supreme Court refused to stop. Now other States say they're looking to replicate the Texas law. If you don't think women's rights are under assault, you're not looking. California, keep Gavin Newsom and send a message to the Nation. Women are to be respected and their rights protected.</p>, <p>Third, by voting no, you'll be protecting California from another Trump climate denier who said global warming is, quote, a ""crock"" and depicts it as a myth. Look, it's hard to believe there's any climate deniers left in America. Let me tell you something: There are. The last place you want someone like that is in the Governor's office in California.</p>, <p><i>Audience member.</i> That's right!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> You all see what's happening: wildfires burning 2 million acres of California this year alone; 5 million acres have burned—5.9 [million]* in the region. That's bigger than the State—entire State of New Jersey, and it's a big State.</p>, <p>The Governor and I were just in Sacramento for a briefing on the Caldor Fire—the Caldor Fire. Last week, I saw the destruction and the death caused by Hurricane Ida in New York, New Jersey, and Louisiana. Folks, extreme weather is here. The climate crisis isn't going away; it's getting worse. We have to deal with it, not deny it.</p>, <p>So, California, you've got to keep Gavin Newsom as Governor and send a message to the Nation that we have to deal with the climate crisis now. We can't wait any longer.</p>, <p>When I got elected President, I immediately rejoined the climate Paris—the Paris climate accord. Just since we put that together in our administration—in Barack's administration—just since then, everything has collapsed even further. We don't have much time. Not a joke. We're talking about 9 to 10 years before we pass the point of no return. And——</p>, <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> You—our children need it. The planet needs it.</p>, <p>Look, fourth, by voting no, you'll be standing up for a Governor who protects workers rather than one who believes there shouldn't be—I can't believe this guy—[<i>laughter</i>]—there shouldn't be a minimum wage?</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> The leading Republican candidate thinks the minimum wage should be zero.</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Look, working people have taken it on the chin too long. We need leaders like Gavin who will respect them, hear them, fight for them. To me, it's pretty basic: If you're working a 40-hour week, you shouldn't be living in poverty. That's why I support a $15 minimum wage. Gavin is leading the way in California.</p>, <p>I'm so tired of trickle-down economics. It's about time we build from the bottom up and the middle out. So, California, keep Gavin and send a message: It's time to give working people just a fighting chance. They have never, ever, ever, ever, ever let the country down. All they want is just an even shot. They have never let the country down.</p>, <p>Folks, I can go on, but here's the deal. I'm going to make this a simple as I can: You either keep Gavin Newsom as your Governor, or you'll get Donald Trump.</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> It's not a joke. A Republican Governor blocking progress on COVID-19, who is also anti-woman, anti-worker, a climate denier, who doesn't believe in choice.</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> The choice should be absolutely clear: Gavin Newsom. You have a Governor who has the courage to lead. In Gavin, you have a Governor who shares the State's values. In Gavin, you have a Governor to make sure Donald Trump's dark, destructive, divisive politics never finds a place in California.</p>, <p>So, please—not a joke—on behalf of the people of Delaware and Pennsylvania and Minnesota and all across America: Don't take anything for granted.</p>, <p>If you're registered, you've got a ballot in the mail. If you haven't opened it, open it, mark ""no,"" and put it in the mailbox tonight. If you want to vote in person, make sure you know where you're going to vote in your county.</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Vote! Vote! Vote!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And if you've already voted, make sure your family and friends are voting tomorrow. California—I mean this sincerely—the eyes of the Nation are on you. I'm not joking. I'm not joking about that. You've got to vote no on the recall. Keep Gavin as Governor. The rest of America is counting on you, and so am I.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you.</p>]"

Biden,"Remarks on Wildfire Response Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters in Mather, California",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-wildfire-response-efforts-and-exchange-with-reporters-mather-california,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Well, folks—thank you, Governor, for those comments. I want to say good afternoon and—to all of you here in this cool hangar. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Earlier today we were briefed by the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. The center located—is a locational hub for our Federal firefighting resources in the region.</p>, <p>And we just surveyed some of the damage of the Caldor Fire here in California, which, in less than a month, has wiped out over 200,000 acres and 1,000 structures, homes; precious memories destroyed; air quality degraded; local economy stopped in its tracks; and nearly 200 people in the area forced to live in shelters.</p>, <p>Everyone in Northern California knows the time of the year when you can't go outside, when the air will be filled with smoke and the sky will turn an apocalyptic shade of orange. Parents worried about keeping their children safe in a pandemic worry about air quality as well.</p>, <p>Thus far, the—nationwide, over 44,000 wildfires have burned nearly 5,300,000 acres, roughly the size of the State of New Jersey. In California, this year, more than 2.2 million acres have burned; the Dixie Fire burned nearly 1 million alone.</p>, <p>And we're working closely with Governor Newsom to make sure California has every resource—every resource available—to keep families safe. And the Governor has led his State with poise and strong leadership. He's been an innovator in items of—for long-term solutions. And he and I are both optimistic.</p>, <p>These fires are blinking ""code red"" for our Nation. They are gaining frequency and ferocity, and we know what we have to do. And it starts with our firefighters putting their lives on the line in rugged and dangerous conditions.</p>, <p>I'll never forget coming out to Arizona in 2013 to speak at the memorial of the 19 Granite Mountain Hotshots who gave their lives. Firefighters are unmatched in their bravery. That's why I took the action I did in June to ensure that all Federal firefighters earn at least the minimum wage, and we're working on fundamentally changing the benefits that are available to them.</p>, <p>FEMA has approved 33 Fire Management Assistance Grants to help Western States pay for the cost of fighting these awful fires. We used the Defense Production Act to address the shortage in firehoses. Because of the pandemic, we found ourselves in a situation where there is a backlog in an awful lot of things. We restarted the idle production line in Oklahoma, bringing back to work and delivering thousands of new feet of new firehoses to the frontlines. It's hard to believe: short on firehoses.</p>, <p>In addition, we've tapped DOD, the Department of Defense, for 10 aircraft; 20 C-130s, a Modular Airborne Fire Fighting Systems—with those systems; and, to help our fire suppression, the RC-26 aircraft to provide critical imagery from space. They're based in California, and they have now flown over 1,000 missions across the West.</p>, <p>Two hundred and fifty Active Duty military troops on ground—on the ground at Dixie Fire in California, working alongside firefighters. We're sharing satellite imagery to help detect and monitor fire growth. And the EPA is using new technology to deliver fire, smoke, and air quality information directly to people's cell phones.</p>, <p>Our friends from Canada and Australia are providing help through both firefighters as well as aircraft.</p>, <p>And my Build Back Better plan includes billions of dollars for wildfire preparedness, resilience, and response; forest management to restore millions of acres and to protect homes and public water sources.</p>, <p>This bipartisan bill includes more than $8 billion to increase resilience in wildfires. And, add to that, counting resolution packages include—the continuing resolution package includes $14 billion in disaster needs, including $9 billion for communities hit by wildfire and drought. We're not going to leave these people in distress.</p>, <p>We know that decades of forest management decisions have created hazardous conditions across the Western forests, but we can't ignore the reality that these wildfires are being supercharged by climate change. It isn't about red or blue States, it's about fires. Just fires.</p>, <p>In the past 2 weeks, I've been to Louisiana, where Hurricane Ida hit, and with winds up to 179 miles an hour, gusting; New Jersey and New York, walking down the streets—Main Streets—meeting with families and first responders, seeing the destruction of these disasters caused: dreams crushed, lives interrupted. Scientists have been warning us for years that extreme weather is going to get more extreme. We're living it in real time now.</p>, <p>Extreme weather cost America, last year, $99 billion. Let me say it again: Extreme weather in the United States cost the United States of America a total of $99 billion. And this year, unfortunately, we're going to break that record. It's a devastating loss to our economy and for so many communities.</p>, <p>When we fail to curb pollution from smokestacks and tailpipes and continue to use fossil fuels as we do, we increase risk that firefighters face. But each dollar we invest in resilience saves up to $6 down the road when the next fire doesn't spread as wisely—as widely, and those investments also save lives.</p>, <p>When I think about climate change, I think about not the cost; I think about good-paying jobs it will create. But I also think about the jobs we're losing due to impacts on the supply chains and industries because we haven't acted boldly enough.</p>, <p>We have to build back—and you've heard me say it a hundred times—not just build back, but build back better, as one Nation. We've got to do it together. We'll get through this together. We just have to keep the faith.</p>, <p>Folks, we have the bipartisan infrastructure bill that's been passed, and it's bipartisan. And I believe we'll get done the so-called reconciliation bill that has another several trillion dollars in it.</p>, <p>Let me close by saying: When people talk about the cost of the Build Back Better proposal beyond the infrastructure, let me remind you: The cost may be as much as $3.5 trillion. But to put that in perspective, it's spent out over 10 years, number one. And number two, it's expected the economy—our economy will grow to $366 trillion GDP by that time. That's less than 1.5 percent total in terms of deficit of that total amount. In addition to that, the—90 percent of it is paid for.</p>, <p>And so, folks, we have to think big. Thinking small is a prescription for disaster. We're going to get this done. This Nation is going to come together, and we are going to beat this climate change.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Wildfire Response and Recovery Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, what do you think about the Governor misrepresenting his administration's wildfire efforts?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> He didn't.</p>]"

I said this has been my office pretty much the last 18 months, with COVID and all these wildfires.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, Gov. Newsom continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>And I'll just end on this, Mr. President: This fire season is just getting going. I'll remind you we lost Paradise in 2018, the second week of November. In 2017, we had one of the largest wildfires in history, in December. We are barely out of August, in the first few weeks now of September.</p>, <p>So we're really humbled and gratified by your support and leadership, and we welcome you here at OES.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, you all are the best. That's not hyperbole. You know, I used to always—as the Governor probably heard from the United States Senators here, I always got kidded when I was a Senator all those years because I'd always quote Irish poets. [<i>Laughter</i>] And they thought I did it because I was Irish. [<i>Laughter</i>] I did it because they're the best poets in the world. [<i>Laughter</i>] But there's a famous line of a poem written by Seamus Heaney. He said: ""All's changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born.""</p>, <p>By the way, you don't have to stand for me. Sit. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And the truth is, all has changed. It's changed in a way that it's never going go back to what it was 10, 15 years ago. It's simply not the case.</p>, <p>When I became President, I committed I'd rejoin an outfit I helped put together, and that was the Paris accord. And things have changed so significantly; I mean that. This is like preaching to the choir, as they say where I'm from. And you all understand it. The idea we're going to go back to a circumstance where we're going to be able to be in a situation like it was in 1960, '70, or '80, it's just not going to be the case.</p>, <p>But we can't afford to let anything slip further. We can't allow that to happen. All the data—and some of you are genuine experts here—all the data shows that to get it to stay below 1.5 degrees centigrade, we have to act more rapidly and more firmly and more broadly than today. It really is a matter of what the world is going to look like. Not a joke. Not a joke.</p>, <p>Gov, I doubt whether you or I would have ever believed that more people died in New York City, in Queens, from flooding than in a hurricane in Louisiana when I was down there with the Gov, with 178-mile-an-hour winds. More people died. They had flood stages that were up to 20 feet—people dying in basements because they've overflowed. They had tornados, so they head to the basement, and how many people got killed because they couldn't get out?</p>, <p>And, folks, there's so much we can do—we can do. And I think even some of my more conservative—I don't want to be flippant—some of my more less-believing friends—[<i>laughter</i>]—in this notion of global warming are, all of a sudden, having an ""altar call,"" as they say in the southern part of Delaware. They're seeing the Lord, because they better see it quickly.</p>, <p>We've got to change. And we've got to not just build back, we've got to build back better than before. I noticed everyone around the world is using that expression now, but it's literal. We're the only country in the world that has gone through crises throughout its career, through our history, and we've come out stronger than we went in. We've got to do that now. We have a chance to build back in a way that not only gets us back to where we were yesterday, but gets us to a place where we are going to be able to sustain that—sustain that position.</p>, <p>For example, we got bipartisan support. I know I get criticized for trying to get bipartisan support, but we got it for the legislation I wrote relating to the whole idea of infrastructure. It's real.</p>, <p>And what I couldn't get done in terms of climate there I was able to put into a thing called the recovery act—the Build Back Better portion of it. Whether that passes or not, exactly how much I don't know, but we're going get it passed. And it has money in there for resilience.</p>, <p>For example, it costs 2,500 bucks an acre for you guys to make sure that you cleared forest floors. Well, guess what? Why can't we have a Civilian Climate Corps made up of thousands of kids—young people who are looking for jobs, getting out and being trained to do it, to build—to build back better?</p>, <p>Everybody knows, if we have resilience—how many times, Gov, have you had to shut down an electric transmission because of the wires coming down in the forest?</p>, <p>Well, we all know if we had excessive—if we had extensive battery technology and storage, it'd be a different world. We all know that if we invested in being able to run power lines underground, it'd cost a hell of a lot more money. But if we made the investment—for every dollar we invest now, we save $6. That's not hyperbole. That is not hyperbole.</p>, <p>We spent over $97 billion because of climate change, and we're sitting with our thumb in our ear, except here. You've been fighting like hell. You've been moving in a way that few States have done.</p>, <p>And you know, the total loss, Gov—if I think of it in terms of back East—the total loss to fires—of fires this past year are larger than the State of—the entire State of New Jersey in terms of distance—of size. The entire State. You all may smile about that, but New Jersey is a big State, man—[<i>laughter</i>]—and it's critically important. That's how much has been lost.</p>, <p>And by the way, the smoke from these fires ends up in New York, New Hampshire. It ends up—people not only worrying; you have to do it all—thank God you've got a Governor who understands there is a COVID crisis, that everybody should be vaccinated. Because guess what? Parents are not only worried now about whether their kids are going to get COVID with the Delta variant, they're worried about whether they can breathe the air.</p>, <p>So there's so much we can do. I really mean it, from the bottom of my heart. There's so much we can do. It's within our power to do it. Let's not lose this advantage.</p>, <p>I was just in the State—a neighboring State called Idaho. Idaho—[<i>laughter</i>]—when I got elected as a 29-year-old Senator, was a Republican State.</p>, <p>[<i>The President made the sign of the cross.</i>]</p>, <p>I don't know what the hell happened. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, excuse me—a Democratic State; now it's a Republican State. Frank Church, Cecil Andrus, and others were the leading Democrats.</p>, <p>But the Governor there is complimentary of your Governor and that we had to have mandates for vaccinations. He's getting the living hell kicked out of him by his Republican colleagues, I think, but he's—but that's what he's doing. So there's hope. There's hope.</p>, <p>And by the way, FEMA has done such an incredible job across the board—across the board. I was on the phone today with a guy who's not real crazy about me—the Governor of Texas—offering him help for the coming hurricane, letting him know: ""Let me know immediately what you need, when you need it. Don't wait. Don't wait.""</p>, <p>So, folks, we have a chance. We have a chance, because of the work you're doing, to make some significant change and literally—I know it sounds like hyperbole—save a generation. Not a joke. Not a joke.</p>, <p>If we don't stay below 1.5 degrees centigrade, in terms of the Earth warming, we're in deep trouble, man. And it's not reversible. It's not like you can go back and start over, like go back to ""Go."" You can't do it.</p>, <p>So what you're doing matters. I think you all realize it, but if you don't realize it, you should. It's incredibly consequential.</p>, <p>I just basically came to say thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for what you're doing.</p>, <p>[<i>The President was brought over to view a slide presentation</i>.]</p>, <p><i>Governor's Office of Emergency Services Director Mark S. Ghilarducci.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]—and we're here to provide a quick briefing to you on the timeline. And you'll hear from—[<i>inaudible</i>]<i>. </i></p>, <p><i>U.S. Forest Service Pacific Southwest Regional Forester Jennifer Eberlien.</i> Thanks so much. Mr. President, it's so great to have you here. And, Governor, thank you.</p>, <p>I'm showing you a map right now of the Caldor Fire. So, just to orient you, this is where Grizzly Flats is at, right here. Placerville is over here. And it goes all the way up here to South Lake Tahoe.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Newsom.</i> Yes, just to situate us and so the President knows, give him a sense of where are we—[<i>inaudible</i>].</p>, <p><i>Regional Forester Eberlien.</i> We are over there.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Newsom.</i> Not too many miles away.</p>, <p><i>Regional Forester Eberlien.</i> No. No. Not very far away.</p>, <p>The ignition started right here out at Omo Ranch.</p>, <p>Could you go the next slide, please?</p>, <p>[<i>Regional Forester Eberline continued her remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>So, being able to work with our partners—we have a shared stewardship agreement with the State. We have Good Neighbor Authority. We are primed and ready to be able to do more, just as you had said.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Newsom.</i> So what you're seeing is—pardon me, Mr. President—about 219,000 acres. They are about—Chief Porter will talk a little bit more—I think you're at over 67-percent contained.</p>, <p><i>Regional Forester Eberlien. </i>Yes. We are.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Newsom.</i> They said that this morning. But remarkably—[<i>inaudible</i>]—and just reinforcing: No fatalities. Remarkable job of evacuation. And peak—I think we're up, close to—what?—53,000 people in the State have been evacuated in some form.</p>, <p><i>Regional Forester Eberlien. </i>Yes, yes.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Newsom.</i> So it's just an extraordinary effort and, again, testament to this frame of partnership that's mutual—not just mutual aid, but the unified command structure, which is just world class.</p>, <p><i>Regional Forester Eberlien.</i> I'm going to turn it over to Chief Porter.</p>, <p><i>California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Director and Fire Chief Thom Porter.</i> Thank you, Jen. Mr. President, thank you for coming and taking a look at this fire, but I want you to get the whole scale of what's going on as well.</p>, <p>[<i>Chief Porter continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>But these two fires are the first two fires that we have in recorded history that burned from the starting point on the west side of the mountains—the mountain range is about center here—all the way to the east side to the desert, basically, the High Desert.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That's where I was looking. [<i>Inaudible</i>]—mountains.</p>, <p><i>Chief Porter.</i> Yes. So—Bryan, if you could go back, I just want to jump back real quick here. So, Lake Tahoe—this breakpoint right here, all the water on this side of these lakes drains to the Sacramento Valley. Everything there drains down into Reno. And that's the first time we've had fire do this as well.</p>, <p>So these are the first two fires that have done that. In 11 months, including the time when this fire started and the Dixie was still burning, six of the seven largest fires in our history burned within an 11-month period. It's incredible what climate change is doing to us.</p>, <p>So, with that, I think I will pass the attention to Don Ashton.</p>, <p><i>Director Ghilarducci. </i>He's the chief administrative officer for El Dorado County, where this fire took place.</p>, <p><i>Chief Administrative Officer Don Ashton of El Dorado County, CA.</i> Thank you, Mr. President, for coming. Thank you, Governor.</p>, <p>Just a little bit about some of the damages we've been facing, what El Dorado County has faced and the Grizzly Flats area. We lost—the whole community is essentially lost—we lost a school, we lost a fire station, we lost a post office. We lost about 440 homes in that area. About 25 percent of those people don't have homeowner's insurance.</p>, <p>So what are we going to do?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> We're going to take care of them.</p>, <p><i>Chief Administrative Officer Ashton.</i> Thank you. Thank you. And if you head up the Highway 50 corridor, we lost another 220 homes, estimated.</p>, <p>And then, one thing I want to reference—and Chief Porter hit on this jag here—I want to talk about this little gap right here, where it hopped over. That's the heroic efforts of our firefighters, from CAL FIRE, all the partner agencies throughout the nation, quite frankly. Those are all homes in that area. They saved—[<i>inaudible</i>].</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> So this is the mountain ridge here?</p>, <p><i>Chief Administrative Officer Ashton.</i> The mountain ridge is probably right here.</p>, <p><i>Participant.</i> That's a valley.</p>, <p><i>Chief Administrative Officer Ashton.</i> This is the valley.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That's the valley. Okay.</p>, <p><i>Chief Administrative Officer Ashton.</i> Right on the bottom of that mountain range.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I gotcha. I gotcha. Okay.</p>, <p><i>Chief Administrative Officer Ashton.</i> Hundreds of homes right there in Christmas Valley that were all saved. We didn't lose one structure in that area because of the efforts of our firefighters and the heroes they are. And then that's a testament of field management that allowed it to be controlled.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, you know that old expression: God made man; then he made a few firefighters. [<i>Laughter</i>] But there's truth to it. Not a joke. And we don't pay firefighters. And the Federal firefighters are going to get a significant raise. I was able to, by Executive order on the Federal side, raise the salary to a minimum of $15 an hour, which is way below, and the benefits.</p>, <p>But, folks, too many of you—too many of the firefighters you're working with are trying to figure out how to save their homes, number one; and number two, how to, even if they're not in harm's way, be able to pay for their mortgages, be able to pay for what they're doing. We owe them. We owe them a whole hell of a lot more. Now, I'm not just saying this. I've been involved with the fire service for the last 40 years. And I'm telling you, it's about time we heed a wakeup call.</p>, <p>I can't dictate—I won't attempt to dictate what States can do or don't do. But the Federal firefighters are going to get rewarded. And in return, hopefully, that puts pressure on making sure firefighters across the board get this.</p>, <p>I mean, Gov, I grew up in a neighborhood—a little steel town called Claymont, Delaware, where you became—and I went to a little Catholic school across from the fire hall. You became one of three things: a cop, a firefighter, or a priest. [<i>Laughter</i>] I wouldn't have qualified for any one of them.</p>, <p>But all kidding aside, it's—these are the folks who—I mean, and thank—and these smokejumpers. I mean, thank God we have some crazy people working with us. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, I'm serious. Think about it. Have you ever—I've been to some of these fires because I got involved with our fire companies. Have you ever, ever been to a fire where there's a house fire, where there's a place—where these guys jumping into—I got a phone call one day, Gov.</p>, <p>I was down doing ""Meet the Press"" on a Sunday. I commuted every day when I was a Senator from Delaware to Washington and back, 260 miles a day. And I was rarely down there on a Sunday, but I was doing ""Meet the Press."" I got a phone call: Lightning strike hit—I live on a little pond—a 10-acre pond that borders my property. Hit a conduit in the side of the hill. It went up underneath and set on fire the internal part of my house, so the air conditioning just was billowing out smoke.</p>, <p>My fire company came, the smoke was so thick—not a joke. And the firefighters—I mean, you could not see into the house, from the basement floor all the way to the third floor. Not a single thing. And my fire service went, and they saved my wife, and, as she says, saved the cat—[<i>laughter</i>]—and my '67 Corvette didn't burn. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But all kidding aside, what these people do—what you all do is incredible. And hopefully, I—when all of this has moved in the right direction, we begin to reward—you know, it's not any insult to law enforcement, but more firefighters are injured or die, as a percent, than police officers do. Police officers, I wouldn't take your job in a heartbeat.</p>, <p>But here's the deal: We've got to start to let people know—know what you do for us—so we can get the kind of support we need to make sure we continue to have this capacity. Because we're going to wear people out. We're going to wear it out because it's not going to be over for a while.</p>, <p>So anyway, I just want to say thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you to the firefighters and law enforcement. A very hard job.</p>, <p><i>Director Ghilarducci.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]—wrap up this briefing by just saying that this whole context of climate change is really having an impact to a State like California. Since 2015, we've had back-to-back-to-back—[<i>inaudible</i>]—wildfires. We're talking about wildfires like this that have taken out whole communities.</p>, <p>In 2017 to 2020 alone, we've lost 50,000 homes by wildfire in this State. That's in the State that's got less than 2-percent vacancy rate. These are rural communities as a whole. These are people who live in these communities. It's an equity issue. They don't have the services. We lost the town of Paradise in 2018. Now, in this fire, we lost two towns: the town of Grizzly Flats and the town of Greenville. These are towns that you lost the store, you lost the hospital, you lost the fire station——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Everything.</p>, <p><i>Director Ghilarducci. </i>——the school. The whole nine yards.</p>, <p>And this is why the whole issue of predisaster mitigation and the efforts that the Governor has raised here and has us working on—I know that you're interested in supporting through grants and others kinds of things, but also that the disaster assistance be—the disaster assistance you provided for the Dixie Fire and the River Fire, Mr. President, was fantastic. And now the Caldor Fire. And to work through the individual assistance to help those people who are uninsured or underinsured.</p>, <p>The people who live in these small, rural communities are typically seniors. They're underserved as a whole. And so we can't let them, sort of, hang out there.</p>, <p>So we appreciate all the work that you've done with that. And we're going to continue to work on all the hazard mitigation efforts and do the fuel treatment and really harden our communities as much as we possibly can.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, Gov, there's a lot that we can do, and it starts off being a Federal responsibility, in my view. And—but there's an awful lot that has to be done, and it can be done.</p>, <p>And you're going to hear people say, ""Biden is proposing all these big projects, and the Build Back Better is going to cost all that money."" You know, let's assume they do pass my $3.5 trillion proposal to build back better, which is $300 billion for fire mitigation, a whole range of things. Okay? That's over 10 years—over 10 years. And it's expected that the economy will grow—the GDP, the economy, over the next 10 years, will be $299 trillion. It's going to be less than one-fifth—well, excuse me—five-tenths of 1 percent of the entire GDP. And we pay for it.</p>, <p>So, all this malarkey—you know, we know we have no problem coming up with $2 trillion in tax cuts for people who don't need it. But—I'm serious.</p>, <p>So we don't—we can't afford not to do it, but we can afford to do it.</p>, <p>And the last thing I want to leave you with: These are jobs. Good jobs. When you think climate change, think of jobs. These are good-paying jobs that aren't going to be $7 an hour or $9 an hour, or $10, or even $15. They're going to be jobs that are going to provide prevailing wage, because so much has to be built in terms of bridges and homes. I mean, there's a lot we can do.</p>, <p>So, please, don't lose faith. Don't lose faith. Again, keep it up. Thank you.</p>]"
9,6,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks During a Briefing at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-during-briefing-the-national-interagency-fire-center-boise-idaho,"[<p><i>Bureau of Land Management Assistant Director for Fire and Aviation Grant Beebe.</i> Mr. President, on behalf of the wildland fire community, I'm proud to welcome you to the National Interagency Fire Center, or NIFC, for short. And we always say NIFC is a place, not an organization. [<i>Laughter</i>]
</p>, <p>We're incredibly proud of it. Thank you for coming. We're honored you're the first President to visit in the 50-year history of the Fire Center, and it's quite an honor.
</p>, <p>I'm Grant Beebe. I'm the Bureau of Land Management's Assistant Director for Fire and Aviation. And speaking for all the NIFC partners, I'd like to thank you particularly for being here and for your genuine and intense interest in wildland fire management.
</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, Assistant Director Beebe continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]
</p>, <p>I'll say people of my age tend to measure fire history in terms of fire seasons, and many of us who are a little longer in the tooth think about the Yellowstone fires of 1988, of course, and what a calamitous fire season that was, and we were sure that was a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence.
</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.
</p>, <p><i>Assistant Director Beebe.</i> I'll just point out that Yellowstone burned about 800,000 acres in the park. And this year, the Dixie Fire, as you know, is approaching about a million acres itself.
</p>, <p>California is setting records for the largest fires in history. Colorado set and then reset records for largest fires in history. So we're entering into a different environment in fire, and we're starting to think about how we need to change our tactics. And we'll talk about that a little bit more.
</p>, <p>So I'll say, finally, that another complex, costly, and critical wildland fire year underscores the Nation's need to recommit resources to fire prevention, preparedness, and response. And frankly, we're honored that you're here and that you have made that measure one of your own.
</p>, <p>I'd like to pass it on to Governor Little now. I know he'd like to introduce you—or to welcome you to Idaho.
</p>, <p><i>Governor Brad Little of Idaho.</i> Thank you, Grant.
</p>, <p>Mr. President, thank you for being here. Grant really put his arms around the all-hands-on-deck in this facility. And all these people that work here is—are a result of years of seeing what didn't work in collaboration and what does. And they just get better at it every year.
</p>, <p>[<i>Gov. Little continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]
</p>, <p>If you can help us do that, to where we can continue to get these fully agreed-upon plans implemented so that we are not endangering these firefighters when we put them out there because we've got forests or even rangeland conditions where the fuels are just almost impossible to fight, it would be very appreciated. And all the Western Governors stand ready to work with you and your administration on it.
</p>, <p>And again, thank you for coming to Boise.
</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, Gov, thank you. I have enjoyed working with the Western Governors.
</p>, <p>I—folks, you know, the press has heard me say this before in a different context—but my colleagues used to always kid me when I was in the Senate; I'm always quoting Irish poets about—when I thought it was appropriate. And I think they thought I was doing it because I was Irish, but I did it because they're the best poets. But—[<i>laughter</i>].
</p>, <p>All kidding aside, there's a line from a famous poem. And I think—I didn't think of it, Grant, till you just were speaking. And it goes like this, it says: ""All is changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born."" A terrible beauty has been born.
</p>, <p>From the Yellowstone Fire to today, all has changed in a drastic, drastic way. I need not tell Robyn, who—National Weather Service—it's changed, and it's not going back. It's not going back. And we and the Western Governors, we've talked about this. And you know, there's an expression I say all the firefighters here: that God made man, and then he made a few firefighters.
</p>, <p>You all are the most incredible people. Now, I'm not being—it's not hyperbole. I started my career with the firefighters as a 29-year-old kid running for the United States Senate, and we've never left one another. And I see the Hotshots out there. I don't want to do any more mass memorial services of the 19 Hotshots that I did back in Arizona.
</p>, <p>And the only thing that keeps you all safe is one another. Firefighters have as many injuries and lose as many people as police officers do. But the only thing that really matters is if there's enough firefighters—firefighters protecting firefighters. That's the big deal. That's what it all comes down to.
</p>, <p>And I just want you to know that you have the full support of my Government—my administration, I should say—and all those who have major roles in the Government, from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Interior—just across the board.
</p>, <p>And so—and I want to acknowledge Senators Risch and Crapo can't be here. And Senator Wyden and Markley were going to come—or, excuse me, Merkley—were going to come from Oregon. We got a call while in flight: The weather is so bad, they can't make it here. And so I just want to thank them for the incredible work they do as well, because this one of the areas where we do have some overwhelming bipartisan support.
</p>, <p>And here at the National Interagency Fire Center, the hub that's designed to coordinate the resources to fight wildfires, I'm here to hear what's on your mind and what more that I should be doing, my administration should be doing to try to help.
</p>, <p>You know, folks, you know the time of the year when the air fills with smoke and the sky turns a little orange, but that time of year is getting earlier every year. And you know, last week, the air in Boise was thick with smoke from California and from Oregon. And you know, this year, as you've pointed out, Grant, you know, 44,000 wildfires; 5.4 million acres burned. That's larger than the entire State of New Jersey.
</p>, <p>When I say that back East—they're used to floods and storms. When I say that back East, they—it's just unfathomable. First of all, they don't fully understand how big the West is, but more acreage is burned than the entire State of New Jersey, which is a big State.
</p>, <p>And you know, California: 2.2 million acres this year—already this year. The Dixie Fire, a million acres. The Caldor Fire: 200,000 acres, 1,000 structures. And God knows how many lives risked or lost trying to deal with it.
</p>, <p>You know, you've saved many communities—the firefighters—and you saved South Lake Tahoe. And you—and what people are beginning to realize is you risk your lives to do it. And thank God—thank God—we have you.
</p>, <p>But you know, fires and frequency and ferocity of these fires—I have—I'm having a lot of international meetings with our colleagues around the world. They're asking. They're asking. Australia, really worried. Australia—helping—but are trying to figure it out. Canada. I mean, just go around the world.
</p>, <p>And so, folks, look: The fact is that we're in a situation where too many memorials are—have been held. And I've directed my administration to provide for pay bonuses and incentives to ensure every Federal firefighter—because that's the only authority I have—makes at least $15 an hour. I mean, they should make a hell of a lot—heck of a lot more, but at least $15 an hour. And I'm committing to work with Congress to raise the pay gap for Federal wildland firefighters.
</p>, <p>FEMA: 33 fire management assistant grants to help States pay for the cost of firefighting. And it's still not enough. The costs are enormous, you have.
</p>, <p>And so, you know, believe it or not, the massive shortage of fire hoses, I think you all get it. But the idea that we went into this fire season with a shortage of fire hoses—that's all I heard from my guys back East and in the Midwest: no fire hoses.
</p>, <p>Well, fortunately, they thought a long time ago about a thing called the National Defense Act. And what I was able to do—the, excuse me, the Defense Production Act. And I was able to restart production of bringing a lot of people back to work, delivering 21,920 new feet of fire hose in the frontlines, putting a company back to work that was out of business that stopped manufacturing.
</p>, <p>You know, when—and the major is here; he knows about this. While we were—we have a commitment at the Department of Defense to defend home, as well as abroad, and that includes the fire service.
</p>, <p>We're now have—we have C-130s for fire suppression, RC-26 aircraft to provide critical fire imagery. And they're based in California. They've flown over 1,000 missions so far—250 Active Duty troops—and I've gotten no pushback from the Department of Defense in this at all—none—to the Dixie Fire in California. And sharing satellite imagery that we have available to us to help monitor growth of the fires.
</p>, <p>I've directed the EPA to use this new technology we have to deliver smoke and fire and air quality information directly to people's iPhones. We'll be able to do that very shortly. It may have already begun in some places.
</p>, <p>And—but one of the things we have to do is, we have to build back better than what happened before all this began to come apart. And so we have a proposal—and by the way, both my Republican colleagues from this State and the Democratic colleagues from Oregon, who were going to try to be here, all—we all support this bill I put together on infrastructure so when we build back, we can build back better than it was before. And it literally provides for billions of dollars for wildfire prepare—wildfire preparedness, resilience and response, forest management, and public water sources—public water sources.
</p>, <p>What people back East don't quite get is that, were it not for the fact we made significant investments years ago in everything from the Hoover Dam to a whole range of other things out here, a lot of people south of you wouldn't have any water and how valuable and serious access to that water is across the board.
</p>, <p>And you know, we need to—we have $14 billion for disaster needs, including $9 billion for communities hit with wildfire and drought. We've got to pass it. We've got to get it done. And it's gone through both Houses.
</p>, <p>But that's going to—I hope, Governor—be of significant help to you, because States can't burden it, especially smaller States; you're a big State. But I mean smaller States, in terms of population, can't carry this on their back. And so, you know, this is a—we're one America. You know, we have a Federal system because each part of the country is supposed to make up for the other country—parts of the country didn't have.
</p>, <p>And so, you know, we need to do more. We've asked for $14 billion for disaster needs, including, as I said, that $9 billion for community—this is over a 10-year period—for—hit by wildfires and drought.
</p>, <p>And you know, we can't continue to try to ignore reality. Barack—President Obama used to always kid me. I'd say, ""You know, reality has a way of working its way in."" Well, you know, the reality is, we have a global warming problem, a serious global warming problem, and it's consequential.
</p>, <p>And what's going to happen is, things aren't going to go back to what they were. It's not like you can build back to what it was before. It's not going to get any better than it is today. It only can get worse, not better. It's not like we're going to not have more problems. But we can do this, in my view. The scientists have warned us for years: The failure to curb pollution from smokestacks and automobiles and a whole range of other things is going to have a—going to take its consequences.
</p>, <p>And I learned a long time ago, Gov, that—as a U.S. Senator back east, that all the major streams and ponds and lakes—for example, in New York State, they were being polluted, the fish were dying, things were changing. And you know what it was all from? It wasn't because of what they were doing in Upstate New York; it's because of smokestacks in Chicago—steel plants—because it carries—the wind carries that pollution at a height that doesn't affect the State of Illinois or doesn't affect the State of Indiana, doesn't affect Ohio, but it eventually comes down.
</p>, <p>Well, you know, I guess you all—I know you all know it. You know, you have the smoke from the fires in California on the East Coast and sometimes blotting out the sky. People are not just worried about COVID; they're worried about whether their kids are going to be breathing.
</p>, <p>And so every dollar we invest in resilience—this is part of my message here, and there's a lot more I want to hear from you that you think we should be doing and I think we should be doing as well. But for every dollar we invest in resilience that is building back better, we save $6 down the road in the future. And you know, you all know the number. Studies show extreme weather cost America last year $99 billion. Extreme weather.
</p>, <p>It's not just fires. I mean, more people died—I just went—I was in Louisiana, Mississippi, and all through the South for Hurricane Ida. Well, guess what? More people died in Brooklyn than died in Louisiana. More people. The floodwaters were immense. Never seen anything like it. People were drowning in their homes because there was tornado warnings to go to their basement, and all of a sudden, the flood comes through the windows, up to the ceiling. Can't get out. People dying.
</p>, <p>So, I guess, to state the obvious, you all are incredible in what you're doing. But I also think about the jobs we're losing due to the impact of supply chains and industries that are being held up.
</p>, <p>I'm looking forward to this briefing. My message to you is: When we build back, we have to build back better. It's not a Democrat thing, it's not a Republican thing—it's a weather thing. It's a reality. It's serious.
</p>, <p>And we can do this. We can do this, and, in the process of building back, we can create jobs, not lose jobs. We can create jobs.
</p>, <p>So my—you know, I'm going to stop here and turn it back to you, Grant. And thanks for hosting us. And I understand, as a former smokejumper, you're crazy too. [<i>Laughter</i>]
</p>, <p><i>Assistant Director Beebe.</i> Used to be.
</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> God love you all.
</p>, <p>I grew up in a little town called Claymont, Delaware, and I went to school—I used to tell Frank Church this—I got a—my first job offer, where I wanted—my wife—deceased wife and I wanted to move to Idaho because we think—not a joke—because it's such a beautiful, beautiful State. And I interviewed for a job with Boise Cascade. And in the meantime, there was a war going on.
</p>, <p>At any rate—but the whole point was that I used to always kid Frank. But I grew up, it was a little steel town called Claymont, Delaware, when Scranton shut down because of coal mining. And I went to a little Catholic grade school called Holy Rosary. And it was on—before I-95, there used to be a thing called the Philadelphia Pike. And so my mom would drive me from—we only lived about a mile from school, and the school bus wasn't around then—and drive me to the parking lot.
</p>, <p>And right across the street from the school was a fire station, Claymont Fire, volunteer fire company, but they're really good. And so all the guys who grew up either became cops, firefighters, or priests. I wasn't qualified for any of them, so I'm here. [<i>Laughter</i>]
</p>, <p>But all kidding aside, you guys and women are incredible. You're incredible at what you do. I'm not—it's not hyperbole. If you know anything about me, you know my long, long, long, long, long relationship with firefighters. I mean it from the bottom of my heart. And we owe you more than just our thanks. We owe you what you need to deal with these problems.
</p>, <p>I'm sorry to go on so long. Thank you.
</p>, <p>And I'll turn it back to you, Grant. And I guess that's who I'm turning it back to. I don't know who—anyway, whoever wants to do the talking.
</p>, <p><i>Assistant Director Beebe.</i> That would be me. Thank you, Mr. President. And you're right, I was a smokejumper, only because I trained to be a teacher and that was way too difficult and scary, so I did something that was way easier. [<i>Laughter</i>]
</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That's why I left the county council.
</p>, <p><i>Assistant Director Beebe.</i> There you go.
</p>, <p>The National Association of State Foresters is a key partner of ours. George Geissler is representing them today. He's a State forester from the great State of Washington.
</p>, <p>Welcome, George. I know you've got a couple things to say, so have at it.
</p>, <p><i>Washington State Forester and Department of Natural Resources Deputy Supervisor for Wildland Fire George Geissler.</i> Yes. Thank you, Grant. And thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity to give you a little bit of insight as to the role that State and local governments can play in our interagency wildland fire management world.
</p>, <p>[<i>Deputy Supervisor Geissler continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]
</p>, <p>And Federal funding, such as State Fire Assistance and Volunteer Fire Assistance that we received through the U.S. Forest Service, actually helps to expand on that capacity as well as maintain it. And all of that is really getting it down to that helping the rural volunteer fire departments that we all know are across the U.S.
</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.
</p>, <p><i>Deputy Supervisor Geissler.</i> The partnership and all of the cooperation between State and local governments, though, it's not just for wildfire suppression, like you said. You know, through Good Neighbor Authority, through shared stewardship, we work together with our local governments, with our Tribal partners, and we do all of the critical fuels mitigation work. We do the forest health treatments that are out there. And we're trying to work, as you said, to improve the resiliency of these landscapes as we go and see the impacts of climate change.
</p>, <p>[<i>Deputy Supervisor Geissler continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]
</p>, <p>So, as chair of the National Association of State Foresters' Wildland Committee, I really do appreciate you coming and putting this focus on wildland fire suppression and what we can all do together to address this issue that we're all facing—be it climate change, landscape resiliency, or threats to our communities. We look forward to working with you.
</p>, <p><i>The President</i>. Can I ask you a question?
</p>, <p><i>Deputy Supervisor Geissler. </i>Of course.
</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>One of the things that I've been working on with some others is——

9,7,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks After Visiting with Firefighters and Their Families on the 20th Anniversary of the September 11th Attacks and an Exchange with Reporters in Shanksville, Pennsylvania",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-after-visiting-with-firefighters-and-their-families-the-20th-anniversary-the,"[<p>Q: Mr. President, what is going through your mind today, sir?
</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: I'm thinking about my -- for real, this is my fourth trip here. And I was thinking about a guy named Davis Sezna that I grew up with, who, like a lot of people, are probably having a tough day today. He -- I was sitting at home watching television in 2000 and -- 2000, in September, and I was watching TV, and my kids were in the swimming pool just outside, and -- and all of a sudden came on TV this guy sitting on a bank
</p>, <p>in the -- on the Delaware and Chesapeake Canal.
</p>, <p>And he -- and they said he just lost his son that ran into a beam that was coming up in the D&amp;C Canal that had been there from another, I guess, dock. And his -- he lost his 15-year-old son, Teddy. And he's on the phone, and all of a sudden, my phone rings, and he's calling me. It turned out to be my buddy, Davis Sezna, because he knew I had lost -- anyway.
</p>, <p>And then, a year later, I got a call. His son was on the 106th floor, and he lost his son. And they called him ""Deeg."" He was Davis Jr.
</p>, <p>And so, it's a tough day for him and everybody who's lost somebody.
</p>, <p>And, you know, I know you've heard me say it before, and I'll probably get criticized for saying it again, but these memorials are really important, but they're also incredibly difficult for the people who were affected by them -- because it brings back the moment you got the phone call. It brings back that instant you got the news, no matter how many years go by.
</p>, <p>So I've been thinking about him. I've been thinking of all the people I was -- when I was down at the rock, talking to a number of family members who lost somebody. You know, think about it -- talk about genuine heroism. I'm not talking about any -- I'm not talking about the news media now. But think of all of you, if you're on that plane, knowing two terrorists are in the cockpit. How many would say, ""I got a good idea: Let's go up and rush that cabin""? Even though you knew that probably they were going to do something and you were going to lose anyway.
</p>, <p>But it's one thing to say, ""I know I should step up,"" and another thing to do it. That's genuine heroism. That's not ""on the margins."" That's not ""maybe you did a heroi-…""
</p>, <p>I mean, you know. And I just -- I just think -- I thought that President Bush made a really good speech today -- genuinely good speech -- about who we are. We're not -- the core of who we are is not divided. It's just this notion of -- I don't know how to explain it.
</p>, <p>I think, Jeff, I talked to you a little about this. I think the real issue for those kids that -- just had a picture taken with -- couple of them had Trump hats from last year -- I think, for them, it's going to be: Are we going to, in the next 4, 5, 6, 10 years, demonstrate that democracies can work, or not?
</p>, <p>Because I had -- just had a long -- I'm not going to discuss with you now, but I had a long conversation with President Xi for over an hour and a half -- not last night; the night before last. And I've had that one-on-one summit with Putin. And I've spoken with others.
</p>, <p>There's a lot of autocrats who truly believe that democracies can't function in the 21st century. Not a joke. They think because the world is changing so rapidly and people are so divided, you can't bring people together in a democracy to get a consensus, and the only ones that are going to be able to succeed are the autocrats.
</p>, <p>That's why it's so damn important we demonstrate -- everybody says, ""Biden, why do you keep insisting on trying to bring the country together?"" That's the thing that's going to affect our wellbeing more than anything else: how the rest of the world responds to us -- knowing that we actually can, in fact, lead by the example of our power again. And I think we can do it. We got to do it.
</p>, <p>And so it's all tied. And meeting with these people -- you know, I know you're all tired of hearing me say, you know -- a lot of good folks on Wall Street, but they didn't build the country. Hardworking middle-class folks built this country, and the unions built the middle class. It's about time we start showing them some real respect again.
</p>, <p>And that's why I'm hopeful. I know a lot of you think I'm just always too optimistic, but I think we're going to get major pieces of legislation through, both on a bipartisan basis, and I think we're going to get something done consequentially -- consequential on the whole issue of dealing with human infrastructure.
</p>, <p>And we do that -- it's more than just how it's going to grow the economy in an exponential way near-term, but the rest of the world is going, ""Whoa. How did he do that? I thought they didn't talk to each other.""
</p>, <p>Anyway, you asked what I was thinking. That's what I've been thinking about today.
</p>, <p>Q: How do you get back to that state of unity that you were talking about and that President Bush was talking about, Mr. President?
</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: By being honest when I make a mistake, by being straightforward, telling people exactly what I want to do, letting them know and -- know that there's nothing -- no hiding the ball.
</p>, <p>You know, if you take a look at the polling data, it is down -- as my numbers have dropped -- you've seen that my package is overwhelmingly popular. Overwhelmingly popular. And so that's why you're going to see -- and I get it -- a lot more direct attacks on me, not what I'm for. And that's -- I'm a big boy. I've been doing this a long time.
</p>, <p>But I really think that, you know, so far, most people, understandably, thought I couldn't get any of this done, I couldn't get the first bill passed. We got it passed. It grew the economy, where, you know -- where, you know, the 40 percent -- anyway.
</p>, <p>So I think it's just a matter of showing -- showing that what I'm saying, when it works, letting it -- be clear how it works, and when it doesn't work, say I'm going to change that.
</p>, <p>But I think people are just looking for, I hope -- we'll find out -- just some straight talk: what should be done, what you believe to be done.
</p>, <p>And I've been doing this long enough. There's, you know -- again, I apologize. For somebody who's covered me a long time, like you, you've heard me say some of this before, but I mean it from the bottom of my heart. I told you the story about when I won as a 29-year-old kid. Everybody said, ""Well, what's the secret? What's the secret? Had to be some special secret. How the hell could I win?"" (Laughs.) You know, straight up. I had to find something. And I said the secret is figuring out what's worth losing over (inaudible). What are you willing to lose over? That's your belief. If you can't figure that one out, you shouldn't run. You shouldn't do it.
</p>, <p>And so the things that I'm pushing, I believe. I believe. Now, I'm not -- it doesn't mean I'm -- you know, everybody has to agree I'm right. I mean -- but I'm just laying out what I think has to be done to bring this country back.
</p>, <p>You've heard me say it a thousand times: This is the most unique country in the whole damn world. We're an idea. It's an idea. It's not based on ethnicity. It's not based on geography. It's not based on religion. It's not based -- it's an idea. It really is. ""We hold these truths…"" I mean, we never lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it, except the last -- previous four years.
</p>, <p>And so, you know, it would be inappropriate for me to tell you the number of serious Republicans in the past, and a few that are still around, who call me and tell me, ""What can I do to help?"" Because they get it too. They may not agree with everything I say, but this idea that, you know, ""What do you want to do with Biden?"" ""I want to box him."" I mean -- you know. I should be so lucky. You know what I mean?
</p>, <p>But it is -- the kinds of things -- or, you know, the stuff that's coming out of Florida, the stuff that's coming out of -- you know, ""If Robert E. Lee had been in Afghanistan, we would have won.""
</p>, <p>Anyway, I'm telling you too much.
</p>, <p>But the point is, what I'm thinking about today is what these people who -- and I've got a piece of -- a small piece of one of the beams they have -- they gave me last time -- or not last time, but how many times ago -- and the flag they gave me. And I'm thinking of, you know, what -- what -- of the people who died, what would they be thinking? They think it makes sense for us to be in this kind of thing, where you ride down the street and someone has a sign saying ""F so and so""? Or -- it's not who we are.
</p>, <p>Q: This is the first anniversary with no war in Afghanistan anymore. Do you think this marks a new phase for the country as it experiences this anniversary 20 years later?
</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think -- look, I do. If you read, there was a big article with 16, 17 people. Was it in, um -- I guess it was -- what was it?
</p>, <p>AIDE: Politico.
</p>, <p>THE PRESIDENT: Politico. And quoting major players over the last 20 years.
</p>, <p>And everybody -- every one of them said they're -- look, this was -- we didn't start off this way. If you had told anybody that we were going to spend 300 million bucks a day for 20 years to try to unite the country after we got bin Laden, after al Qaeda was wiped out there -- can al Qaeda come back? Yeah. But guess what? It's already back in other places.
</p>, <p>What's the strategy? Every place where al Qaeda is we're going to invade and have troops stay there? Come on.
</p>, <p>Anyway. So, I just think that -- and, again, what people are -- as I read it, I'm told, people -- 70 percent of the American people think it was time to get out of Afghanistan -- spending all of that money.
</p>, <p>But the flip of it is, they didn't like the way we got out. But it's hard to explain to anybody how else could you get out.
</p>, <p>For example, if we were in Tajikistan and we pulled up with a C-130 and said, ""We're going to let, you know, anybody who was involved with being sympathetic to us to get on the plane,"" you'd have people hanging in the wheel well. Come on.
</p>, <p>So -- but you guys got a tough job, and I'm glad I don't have it.
</p>, <p>So, anyway, I'm going to do my thing.</p>]"
9,8,George W. Bush,"Remarks on the Twentieth Anniversary of the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks in Shanksville, Pennsylvania",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-twentieth-anniversary-the-911-terrorist-attacks-shanksville-pennsylvania,"[<p>Thank you all. Thank you very much. Laura and I are honored to be with you, Madam Vice President, Vice President Cheney, Gov. Wolf, Secretary Haaland, and distinguished guests.</p>, <p>Twenty years ago, we all found, in different ways, in different places, but all at the same moment, that our lives would be changed forever.</p>, <p>The world was loud with carnage and sirens, and then quiet with missing voices that would never be heard again. These lives remain precious to our country and infinitely precious to many of you. Today, we remember your loss, we share your sorrow and we honor the men and women that you have loved so long and so well.</p>, <p>For those too young to recall that clear September day, it is hard to describe the mix of feelings we experienced. There was horror at the scale of destruction and awe at the bravery and kindness that rose to meet it. There was shock at the audacity of evil and gratitude for the heroism and decency that opposed it.</p>, <p>In the sacrifice of first responders and the mutual aid of strangers, in the solidarity of grief and grace, the actions of an enemy revealed the spirit of the people. And we were proud of our wounded nation.</p>, <p>In these memories, the passengers and crew of Flight 93 must always have an honored place. Here, the intended targets became the instruments of rescue, and many who are now alive owe a vast, unconscious debt to the defiance displayed in the skies above this field.</p>, <p>It would be a mistake to idealize the experience of those terrible events. All that many people could initially see was the brute randomness of death. All that many could feel was unearned suffering. All that many could hear was God's terrible silence. There are many who still struggle with the lonely pain that cuts deep within.</p>, <p>In those fateful hours, we learned other lessons as well. We saw that Americans were vulnerable, but not fragile. That they possessed a core of strength that survives the worst that life can bring. We learned that bravery is more common than we imagined, emerging with sudden splendor in the face of death. We vividly felt how every hour with our loved ones was a temporary and holy gift. And we found that even the longest days end.</p>, <p>Many of us have tried to make spiritual sense of these events. There is no simple explanation for the mix of providence and human will that sets the direction of our lives. But comfort can come from a different sort of knowledge. After wandering in the dark, many have found they were actually walking step by step toward grace.</p>, <p>As a nation our adjustments have been profound. Many Americans struggled to understand why an enemy would hate us with such zeal. The security measures incorporated into our lives are both sources of comfort and reminders of our vulnerability. And we have seen growing evidence that the dangers to our country can come not only across borders but from violence that gathers within.</p>, <p>There's little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and violent extremists at home. But in their disdain for pluralism, in their disregard of human life, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul spirit, and it is our continuing duty to confront them.</p>, <p>After 9/11, millions of brave Americans stepped forward and volunteered to serve in the armed forces. The military measures taken over the last 20 years to pursue dangers at their source have led to debate. But one thing is certain: We owe an assurance to all those who have fought our nation's most recent battles.</p>, <p>Let me speak directly to veterans and people in uniform. The cause you pursued at the call of duty is the noblest America has to offer. You have shielded your fellow citizens from danger. You have defended the beliefs of your country and advanced the rights of the downtrodden. You have been the face of hope and mercy in dark places. You have been a force for good in the world. Nothing that has followed -- nothing -- can tarnish your honor or diminish your accomplishments. To you and the honored dead, our country is forever grateful.</p>, <p>In the weeks and months following the 9/11 attacks, I was proud to lead an amazing, resilient united people. When it comes to the unity of American people, those days seem distant from our own. Malign force seems at work in our common life that turns every disagreement into an argument and every argument into a clash of cultures. So much of our politics has become a naked appeal to anger, fear and resentment. That leaves us worried about our nation and our future together. I come without explanations or solutions. I can only tell you what I've seen.</p>, <p>On America's day of trial and grief I saw millions of people instinctively grab for a neighbor's hand and rally to the cause of one another. That is the America I know. At a time when religious bigotry might have flowed freely, I saw Americans reject prejudice and embrace people of Muslim faith. That is the nation I know. At a time when nativism could have stirred hatred and violence against people perceived as outsiders, I saw Americans reaffirm their welcome to immigrants and refugees. That is the nation I know. At a time when some viewed the rising generation as individualistic and decadent, I saw young people embrace an ethic of service and rise to selfless action. That is the nation I know.</p>, <p>This is not mere nostalgia, it is the truest version of ourselves. It is what we have been, and what we can be again. Twenty years ago, terrorists chose a random group of Americans on a routine flight to be collateral damage in a spectacular act of terror. The 33 passengers and seven crew of Flight 93 could have been any group of citizens selected by fate. In a sense, they stood in for us all.</p>, <p>The terrorists soon discovered that a random group of Americans is an exceptional group of people, facing an impossible circumstance. They comforted their loved ones by phone, braced each other for action and defeated the designs of evil.</p>, <p>These Americans were brave, strong and united in ways that shocked the terrorists but should not surprise any of us. This is the nation we know. And whenever we need hope and inspiration, we can look to the skies and remember. God bless.</p>]"
9,9,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on School Reopening Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-school-reopening-efforts-and-exchange-with-reporters,"[<p><i>The President.</i> What an impressive young man.</p>, <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> You know, when I was your age—are you going to sit down, babe, or are you going to stand?</p>, <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Oh, yes. We're going to sit down. I forgot. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, you don't have to. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Elijah, when I was your age in eighth grade, I wasn't a bad student, but—and I wasn't a bad athlete, but I'll tell you what: I could no more do what you just did than fly. Because I used to talk—t—t—talk—talk like—like that. I stuttered, and especially when I had to do something in public or read aloud. And I am amazed when I see young women and men like you who can stand up and speak with such grace and ease. It's really impressive—really, really impressive.</p>, <p>Well, folks, this is not like the school I went to. [<i>Laughter</i>] When they said we were going to speak outside, I wondered, ""Why the hell are we going up all these stairs? [<i>Laughter</i>] I thought we'd be out in the parking lot. I mean, for real. That's where I thought we were going to be.</p>, <p>Elijah, thank you for the introduction. And Jill and I, along with Secretary Cardona and Mayor Bowser, are here because we want you to know how very proud—how very proud—of you and your classmates we all are.</p>, <p>I also want to thank Principal Richardson. I was kidding him. I was saying, ""I—this school is really something else."" And the way we talked about the interfacing of all the students and the social education that's taking place and how things are changing. And, Chancellor Ferebee, I told you, I think that's maybe the harder job than about anything I can think of. But thank you. You're doing a heck of a job.</p>, <p>We know the start of a school year is an excellent time to mix anticipation and nervousness, and the pandemic adds to that mix of emotions.</p>, <p>And I think about all of the parents I've talked to since the start of this pandemic, worried about the loss of learning of their child, of missed opportunities their child is having because so many of them had to stay at home. We all had to stay at home. But so many of them didn't have access to the internet, didn't have access to—I mean, it just was—didn't have the equipment, worried about whether or not the school lunch program was going to still be available. There was so much anxiety.</p>, <p>And it's not just academics, it's the friendships and the socialization that may be equally as consequential. You know, it's access to critical services, like meals, school counseling that helps the students stay physically and mentally alert.</p>, <p>But I want to—I want folks to know that we're going to be okay. We're going to be okay. We know what it takes to keep our children safe and our schools open, and we have the tools to do it.</p>, <p>Last night I laid out a plan for the fall to beat this pandemic, and basically, it has six parts: Vaccinate the unvaccinated—and thank you for getting the vaccination, and thank your parents for doing that. And protect the—two is to protect the vaccinated. Three is increase testing and masking. Four is to take care of people with COVID. Five is to keep our economy going. And six is keep our children safe and in school and schools open.</p>, <p>Now, any parent—now, for any parent, it doesn't matter how low the risk of any illness is when it could happen to your child. But we all know, if schools follow the science—and they are here—and implement safety measures like vaccinations, testing, masking, then children can be safe in schools, safe from COVID-19.</p>, <p>My plan does all of these things. On vaccinations, it comes down to two separate categories: children ages 12 and older, like Elijah, who are eligible for vaccines—and he got his; children ages 11 and under who are not yet eligible. The safest thing you can do for your child 12 and older is get them vaccinated. That's it: simple, plain, straightforward. Get them vaccinated. So, parents, get your teenagers vaccinated. You've got them vaccinated for all kinds of other things: measles, mumps, rubella. For them to go to school, to be able to play sports, they've had to have those vaccinations. Get them vaccinated.</p>, <p>The COVID-19 vaccine is easy, it is safe, and it's convenient. And we've worked to bring the vaccine clinics to our schools as well. Mayor Bowser has done one heck of job setting—no, you really have, Mayor. You're doing a heck of a job across the board; I really mean that. But I'm—you set up vaccination clinics in about 20 school sites, including here in Brookland—the way the kids are going to continue through the month of September.</p>, <p>So there's really no excuse to not be able. You can get vaccinated. It's not like it's so distant to do.</p>, <p>You know, we're giving prizes and incentives to encourage children and families to get the shots. And look, their efforts are working: 65 percent of the children ages 12 to 17 here in DC have gotten at least one shot, like Elijah. That's incredible. That's one of the highest rates in the Nation for children between the ages of 12 and 17.</p>, <p>And for students here at Brookland, once you all get vaccinated, you're invited to a special visit at the White House. I don't—I'm going to get in trouble with the Secret Service and everybody else, and I'm not sure how we're going to mechanically do it—[<i>laughter</i>]—but I assume the buses can get you to the White House. And if we can't get you all in one room, we'll be out in the Rose Garden or out in the back there and maybe let you fly the helicopters or, no—[<i>laughter</i>]. I'm only joking about that.</p>, <p>I was just downstairs in the science class. It's amazing—and you saw it, Mayor—it's amazing these kids are excited about building a vehicle that can land on the Moon. I really mean it. And I asked them, I said, ""How many of you want to go to the Moon?"" And everybody but one said they wanted to go to the Moon. [<i>Laughter</i>] I asked, ""How many want to go to Mars?"" And I think they all raised their hand as well. But it's really—and they're excited about it.</p>, <p>Now, the best way for parents to protect a child under 12 starts at home. Every parent, every teen sibling, every caregiver around them should be vaccinated. Children have four times higher chance of getting hospitalized if they live in an area with low vaccination rates rather than high vaccination rates. It goes for the home as well. There's a high vaccination rate in the home, which significantly diminishes the possibilities.</p>, <p>Now, if you're a parent of a young child, you're wondering when will the vaccine be available for them. I strongly support independent scientific review of vaccine usage for children under 12. But I've told them I will do everything within my power to support the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, on its ongoing efforts to do the science as safely and as quickly as possible. And our Nation's doctors will keep the public updated on the process so parents can have a plan, to give them the sense of what progress is being made.</p>, <p>The vaccinations of our educators—today, about 90 percent of school staff and teachers are vaccinated. We should have that at 100 percent.</p>, <p>We're requiring vaccination for teachers where I have authority to require it—who work in U.S. Government and educators in Head Start, which is a Federal program because it's funded by the Federal Government. But I'm calling on all Governors to require vaccinations for all teachers and staff. Vaccination requirements in schools were nothing new. They work. They're overwhelmingly supported by educators and their unions.</p>, <p>Now, on school safety measures: In our American Rescue Plan, which we passed early on, we provided the funding for ventilation systems, cleaning and sanitizing services, and critical safety measures to significantly reduce the spread of the virus and protect our children and keep our schools safe. And we will do whatever it takes this school year as well, especially—especially—on increasing testing.</p>, <p>We provided funding through the American Rescue Plan to implement testing in schools for teachers, staffs, and students. And that includes bus drivers as well. I want all—I want all—schools setting up regular testing programs to make sure we detect and isolate cases before they can spread.</p>, <p>I will mobilize American industry to produce [procure]* nearly 300 million more rapid COVID-19 tests for distribution all around the country, including to schools that need them. You know, I'm going to use what we call the Defense Production Act that allows me to ensure that we—what we need made, we can ask the private enterprise to make them because they're of national interest—where they're going to make these tests as quickly as possible, and I'm going to use the Defense Production Act.</p>, <p>My plan will also expand free testing that you can get at one—at 10,000 pharmacies around the country. Walmart, Amazon, and Kroger's will sell at-home rapid tests at cost, which means it will cost—they're going to charge no more than it costs them to buy the tests from the manufacturer. And that will be the same way for the next 3 months. That's a discount about 35 percent—about 35 percent.</p>, <p>This is important for everyone, particularly for a parent of a child not old enough to be vaccinated. You'll be able to test your child at home and to test those around them as well.</p>, <p>And on masking: We know masks work. They are uncomfortable sometimes, and they get tired of wearing them. I understand. I really do. And I wear them in the White House. Under the CDC guidelines, every person in a school—teachers, staff, students—should be masked while indoors.</p>, <p>To all the school officials trying to do the right thing by our children, I will always be on your side no matter how much heat you're getting from outside.</p>, <p>Now let me close with this: I've often said that our children are the kite strings—they're all our children, not just our children; everybody's children—they're the kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft. That's not hyperbole; that's a fact. We owe it to them to do everything we can to keep them safe in school: dreaming, learning, thriving, socializing, becoming good citizens.</p>, <p>It means following the science, wearing a mask, getting tested, getting vaccinated. It means working together and looking out for each other, like they teach you in school. We can look out for each other. We can do this.</p>, <p>I think you're going to have a great school year. I can see the enthusiasm and the—you just walk in the classroom; there's real enthusiasm. I'm—it's not—I'm sure there's some classrooms I was in through school where anybody walked in, it would be: ""Oh, here you go. Eh."" [<i>Laughter</i>] But you've been really great. You really have. And, Principal, this is a—you've done a great job here. You really have.</p>, <p>And I think this is—I hope everybody gets to see this. I wish I could take the whole Nation around this—every one of these classrooms and see what's going on, because it's such a great example.</p>, <p>So again, thank you. Have a great school year.</p>, <p>And, Elijah, I'm going to find out if I can—if I can find out when your football games are. I may want to try to figure out without 10,000 Secret Service agents—[<i>laughter</i>]—to come and see you play a little bit. Okay?</p>, <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Federal Coronavirus Vaccination Requirements/Partisan Political Climate </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, what is your message to Republicans who are calling your vaccine requirements an ""overreach,"" who are threatening to challenge it in court?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> ""Have at it."" [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Look, I'm so disappointed that particularly some Republican Governors have been so cavalier with the health of these kids, so cavalier with the health of their communities. This is—we're playing for real here. This isn't a game. And I don't know of any scientist out there in this field that doesn't think it makes considerable sense to do the six things I've suggested.</p>, <p>And—but you know, it's—let me conclude with this: I—one of the lessons I hope our students can unlearn is that politics doesn't have to be this way. Politics doesn't have to be this way. They're growing up in an environment where they see it's like a war, like a bitter feud. If the—if a Democrat says ""right,"" everybody says ""left."" If a Democrat says ""left,"" they say ""right.""</p>, <p>I mean, it's not how we are. It's not who we are as a nation. And it's not how we beat every other crisis in our history. We've got to come together.</p>, <p>And I think the vast majority—look at the polling data, the vast majority the American people know we have to do these things. They're hard, but necessary. We're going to get them done.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>]"
10,0,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-covid-19-response-and-national-vaccination-efforts-1,"[<p>Good evening, my fellow Americans. I want to talk to you about where we are in the battle against COVID-19, the progress we've made, and the work we have left to do.</p>, <p>And it starts with understanding this: Even as the Delta variant 19 has—COVID-19—has been hitting this country hard, we have the tools to combat the virus, if we can come together as a country and use those tools. If we raise our vaccination rate, protect ourselves and others with masking and expanded testing, and identify people who are infected, we can and we will turn the tide on COVID-19.</p>, <p>It will take a lot of hard work, and it's going to take some time. Many of us are frustrated with the nearly 80 million Americans who are still not vaccinated, even though the vaccine is safe, effective, and free.</p>, <p>You might be confused about what is true and what is false about COVID-19. So before I outline the new steps to fight COVID-19 that I'm going to be announcing tonight, let me give you some clear information about where we stand.</p>, <p>First, we have made considerable progress in battling COVID-19. When I became President, about 2 million Americans were fully vaccinated. Today, over 175 million Americans have that protection.</p>, <p>Before I took office, we hadn't ordered enough vaccine for every American. Just weeks in office, we did. The week before I took office, on January 20 of this year, over 25,000 Americans died that week from COVID-19. Last week, that grim weekly toll was down 70 percent.</p>, <p>And in the 3 months before I took office, our economy was faltering, creating just 50,000 jobs a month. We're now averaging 700,000 new jobs a month in the past 3 months.</p>, <p>This progress is real. But while America is in much better shape than it was 7 months ago when I took office, I need to tell you a second fact. We're in a tough stretch, and it could last for a while. The highly contagious Delta variant that I began to warn America about back in July spread in late summer like it did in other countries before us.</p>, <p>While the vaccines provide strong protection for the vaccinated, we read about, we hear about, and we see the stories of hospitalized people, people on their death beds, among the unvaccinated over the past few weeks.</p>, <p>This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. And it's caused by the fact that despite America having unprecedented and successful vaccination program, despite the fact that for almost 5 months free vaccines have been available in 80,000 different locations, we still have nearly 80 million Americans who have failed to get the shot.</p>, <p>And to make matters worse, there are elected officials actively working to undermine the fight against COVID-19. Instead of encouraging people to get vaccinated and mask up, they're ordering mobile morgues for the unvaccinated dying from COVID in their communities. This is totally unacceptable.</p>, <p>Third, if you wonder how all this adds up, here's the math: The vast majority of Americans are doing the right thing. Nearly three quarters of the eligible have gotten at least one shot, but one quarter has not gotten any. That's nearly 80 million Americans not vaccinated. In a country as large as ours, that's 25-percent minority. That 25 percent can cause a lot of damage, and they are.</p>, <p>The unvaccinated overcrowd our hospitals, are overrunning emergency rooms and intensive care units, leaving no room for someone with a heart attack or pancreatitis or cancer.</p>, <p>And fourth, I want to emphasize that the vaccines provide very strong protection from severe illness from COVID-19. I know there's a lot of confusion and misinformation. But the world's leading scientists confirm that if you are fully vaccinated, your risk of severe illness from COVID-19 is very low. In fact, based on available data from the summer, only one of out of every 160,000 fully vaccinated Americans was hospitalized for COVID per day. These are the facts.</p>, <p>So here's where we stand: The path ahead, even with the Delta variant, is not nearly as bad as last winter. But what makes it incredibly more frustrating is that we have the tools to combat COVID-19, and a distinct minority of Americans—supported by a distinct minority of elected officials—are keeping us from turning the corner. These pandemic politics, as I refer to it, are making people sick, causing unvaccinated people to die.</p>, <p>We cannot allow these actions to stand in the way of protecting the large majority of Americans who have done their part and want to get back to life as normal.</p>, <p>As your President, I'm announcing tonight a new plan to require more Americans to be vaccinated, to combat those blocking public health. My plan also increases testing, protects our economy, and will make our kids safer in schools. It consists of six broad areas of action and many specific measures in each that—and each of those actions that you can read more about at whitehouse.gov—whitehouse.gov.</p>, <p>The measures—these are going to take time to have full impact. But if we implement them, I believe and the scientists indicate, that the months ahead we can reduce the number of unvaccinated Americans, decrease hospitalizations and deaths, and allow our children to go to school safely and keep our economy strong by keeping businesses open.</p>, <p>First, we must increase vaccinations among the unvaccinated with new vaccination requirements. Of the nearly 80 million eligible Americans who have not gotten vaccinated, many said they were waiting for approval from the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA. Well, last month, the FDA granted that approval.</p>, <p>So the time for waiting is over. This summer, we made progress through the combination of vaccine requirements and incentives, as well as the FDA approval. Four million more people got their first shot in August than they did in July.</p>, <p>But we need to do more. This is not about freedom or personal choice, it's about protecting yourself and those around you: the people you work with, the people you care about, the people you love.</p>, <p>My job as President is to protect all Americans. So tonight I'm announcing that the Department of Labor is developing an emergency rule to require all employers with 100 or more employees, that together employ over 80 million workers, to ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated or show a negative test at least once a week. Some of the biggest companies are already requiring this: United Airlines, Disney, Tysons Food, and even Fox News.</p>, <p>The bottom line: We're going to protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated coworkers. We're going to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by increasing the share of the workforce that is vaccinated in businesses all across America.</p>, <p>My plan will extend the vaccination requirements that I previously issued in the health care field. Already, I've announced, we'll be requiring vaccinations at all nursing home workers who treat patients on Medicare and Medicaid, because I had that Federal authority.</p>, <p>Tonight I'm using that same authority to expand that to cover those who work in hospitals, home health care facilities, or other medical facilities, a total of 17 million health care workers. If you're seeking care at a health facility, you should be able to know that the people treating you are vaccinated. Simple. Straightforward. Period.</p>, <p>Next, I will sign an Executive order that will now require all Executive branch Federal employees to be vaccinated—all. And I've signed another Executive order that will require Federal contractors to do the same. If you want to work with the Federal Government and do business with us, get vaccinated. If you want to do business with the Federal Government, vaccinate your workforce.</p>, <p>And tonight I'm removing one of the last remaining obstacles that make it difficult for you to get vaccinated. The Department of Labor will require employers with 100 or more workers to give those workers paid time off to get vaccinated. No one should lose pay in order to get vaccinated or take a loved one to get vaccinated.</p>, <p>Today, in total, the vaccine requirements in my plan will affect about 100 million Americans, two-thirds of all workers. And for other sectors, I issue this appeal: To those of you running large entertainment venues—from sports arenas to concert venues to movie theaters—please require folks to get vaccinated or show a negative test as a condition of entry.</p>, <p>And to the Nation's family physicians, pediatricians, GPs—general practitioners—you're the most trusted medical voice to your patients. You may be the one person who can get someone to change their mind about being vaccinated. Tonight I'm asking each of you to reach out to your unvaccinated patients over the next 2 weeks and make a personal appeal to them to get the shot. America needs your personal involvement in this critical effort.</p>, <p>And my message to unvaccinated Americans is this: What more is there to wait for? What more do you need to see? We've made vaccinations free, safe, and convenient. The vaccine has FDA approval. Over 200 million Americans have gotten at least one shot.</p>, <p>We've been patient, but our patience is wearing thin. And your refusal has cost all of us. So, please, do the right thing. But just don't take it from me; listen to the voices of unvaccinated Americans who are lying in hospital beds, taking their final breaths, saying, ""If only I had gotten vaccinated."" If only. It's a tragedy. Please don't let it become yours.</p>, <p>The second piece of my plan is continuing to protect the vaccinated. For the vast majority of you who have gotten vaccinated, I understand your anger at those who haven't gotten vaccinated. I understand the anxiety about getting a ""breakthrough"" case.</p>, <p>But as the science makes clear, if you're fully vaccinated, you're highly protected from severe illness, even if you get COVID-19. In fact, recent data indicates there is only one confirmed positive case per 5,000 fully vaccinated Americans per day. You're as safe as possible, and we're doing everything we can to keep it that way—keep it that way, keep you safe.</p>, <p>That's where boosters come in, the shots that give you even more protection than after your second shot. Now, I know there's been some confusion about boosters. So let me be clear: Last month, our top Government doctors announced an initial plan for booster shots for vaccinated Americans. They believe that a booster is likely to provide the highest level of protection yet.</p>, <p>Of course, the decision of which booster shots to give or when to start them and who will give them will be left completely to the scientists at the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control. But while we wait, we've done our part. We bought enough boosters—enough booster shots—and the distribution system is ready to administer them.</p>, <p>As soon as they are authorized, those eligible will be able to get a booster right away in tens of thousands of site across the—sites across the country for most Americans, at your nearby drug store, and for free.</p>, <p>The third piece of my plan is keeping—and maybe the most important—is keeping our children safe and our schools open. For any parent, it doesn't matter how low the risk of any illness or accident is when it comes to your child or grandchild. Trust me, I know.</p>, <p>So let me speak to you directly. Let me speak to you directly to help ease some of your worries. It comes down to two separate categories: children ages 12 and older who are eligible for a vaccine now and children ages 11 and under who are not are yet eligible. The safest thing for your child 12 and older is to get them vaccinated. They get vaccinated for a lot of things. That's it. Get them vaccinated.</p>, <p>As with adults, almost all the serious COVID-19 cases we're seeing among adolescents are in unvaccinated 12- to 17-year-olds—an age group that lags behind in vaccination rates. So, parents, please get your teenager vaccinated.</p>, <p>What about children under the age of 12 who can't get vaccinated yet? Well, the best way for a parent to protect their child under the age of 12 starts at home. Every parent, every teen sibling, every caregiver around them should be vaccinated.</p>, <p>Children have four times higher chance of getting hospitalized if they live in a State with low vaccination rates rather than the States with high vaccination rates.</p>, <p>Now, if you're a parent of a young child, you're wondering when will it be—when will it be—the vaccine available for them. I strongly support an independent scientific review for vaccine uses for children under 12. We can't take shortcuts with that scientific work.</p>, <p>But I've made it clear I will do everything within my power to support the FDA with any resource it needs to continue to do this as safely and as quickly as possible, and our Nation's top doctors are committed to keeping the public at large updated on the process so parents can plan.</p>, <p>Now, to the schools. We know that if schools follow the science and implement the safety measures—like testing, masking, adequate ventilation systems that we provided the money for, social distancing, and vaccinations—then children can be safe from COVID-19 in schools.</p>, <p>Today, about 90 percent of school staffs and teachers are vaccinated. We should get that to 100 percent. My administration has already acquired teachers at the schools run by the Defense Department—because I have the authority as President in the Federal system—the Defense Department and the Interior Department—to get vaccinated. That's authority I possess.</p>, <p>Tonight I'm announcing that we'll require all of nearly 300,000 educators in the Federal-paid program, Head Start program, must be vaccinated as well to protect your youngest—our youngest—most precious Americans and give parents the comfort. And tonight I'm calling on all Governors to require vaccination for all teachers and staff. Some already have done so, but we need more to step up.</p>, <p>Vaccination requirements in schools are nothing new. They work. They're overwhelmingly supported by educators and their unions. And to all school officials trying to do the right thing by our children: I'll always be on your side.</p>, <p>Let me be blunt. My plan also takes on elected officials and States that are undermining you and these lifesaving actions. Right now local school officials are trying to keep children safe in a pandemic while their Governor picks a fight with them and even threatens their salaries or their jobs. Talk about bullying in schools. If they'll not help—if these Governors won't help us beat the pandemic, I'll use my power as President to get them out of the way.</p>, <p>The Department of Education has already begun to take legal action against States undermining protection that local school officials have ordered. Any teacher or school official whose pay is withheld for doing the right thing, we will have that pay restored by the Federal Government 100 percent. I promise you I will have your back.</p>, <p>The fourth piece of my plan is increasing testing and masking. From the start, America has failed to do enough COVID-19 testing. In order to better detect and control the Delta variant, I'm taking steps tonight to make testing more available, more affordable, and more convenient. I'll use the Defense Production Act to increase production of rapid tests, including those that you can use at home.</p>, <p>While that production is ramping up, my administration has worked with top retailers, like Walmart, Amazon, and Kroger's, and tonight we're announcing that, no later than next week, each of these outlets will start to sell at-home rapid test kits at cost for the next 3 months. This is an immediate price reduction for at-home test kits for up to 35-percent reduction.</p>, <p>We'll also expand free testing at 10,000 pharmacies around the country. And we'll commit—we're committing $2 billion to purchase nearly 300 million rapid tests for distribution to community health centers, food banks, schools, so that every American, no matter their income, can access free and convenient tests. This is important to everyone, particularly for a parent or a child—with a child not old enough to be vaccinated. You'll be able to test them at home and test those around them.</p>, <p>In addition to testing, we know masking helps stop the spread of COVID-19. That's why when I came into office, I required masks for all Federal buildings and on Federal lands, on airlines, and other modes of transportation.</p>, <p>Today—tonight I'm announcing that the Transportation Safety Administration, the TSA, will double the fines on travelers that refuse to mask. If you break the rules, be prepared to pay.</p>, <p>And by the way, show some respect. The anger you see on television toward flight attendants and others doing their job is wrong; it's ugly.</p>, <p>The fifth piece of my plan is protecting our economic recovery. Because of our vaccination program and the American Rescue Plan, which we passed early in my administration, we've had record job creation for a new administration, economic growth unmatched in 40 years. We cannot let unvaccinated do this progress—undo it, turn it back.</p>, <p>So tonight, I'm announcing additional steps to strengthen our economic recovery. We'll be expanding COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan programs. That's a program that's going to allow small businesses to borrow up to $2 million from the current $500,000 to keep going if COVID-19 impacts on their sales.</p>, <p>These low-interest, long-term loans require no repayment for 2 years and be can used to hire and retain workers, purchase inventory, or even pay down higher cost debt racked up since the pandemic began. I'll also be taking additional steps to help small businesses stay afloat during the pandemic.</p>, <p>Sixth, we're going to continue to improve the care of those who do get COVID-19. In early July, I announced the deployment of surge response teams. These are teams comprised of experts from the Department of Health and Human Services, the CDC, the Defense Department, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to areas in the country that need help to stem the spread of COVID-19.</p>, <p>Since then, the Federal Government has deployed nearly 1,000 staff, including doctors, nurses, paramedics, into 18 States. Today I'm announcing that the Defense Department will double the number of military health teams that they'll deploy to help their fellow Americans in hospitals around the country.</p>, <p>Additionally, we're increasing the availability of new medicines recommended by real doctors, not conspiracy theorists. The monoclonal antibody treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by up to 70 percent for unvaccinated people at risk of developing severe disease.</p>, <p>We've already distributed 1.4 million courses of these treatments to save lives and reduce the strain on hospitals. Tonight I'm announcing we will increase the average pace of shipment across the country of free monoclonal antibody treatments by another 50 percent.</p>, <p>Before I close, let me say this: Communities of color are disproportionately impacted by this virus. And, as we continue to battle COVID-19, we will ensure that equity continues to be at the center of our response. We'll ensure that everyone is reached. My first responsibility as President is to protect the American people and make sure we have enough vaccine for every American, including enough boosters for every American who's approved to get one.</p>, <p>We also know this virus transcends borders. That's why, even as we execute this plan at home, we need to continue fighting the virus overseas, continue to be the arsenal of vaccines. We're proud to have donated nearly 140 million vaccines over 90 countries, more than all other countries combined, including Europe, China, and Russia combined. That's American leadership on a global stage, and that's just the beginning.</p>, <p>We've also now started to ship another 500 million COVID vaccines—Pfizer vaccines—purchased to donate to 100 lower income countries in need of vaccines. And I'll be announcing additional steps to help the rest of the world later this month.</p>, <p>As I recently released the key parts of my pandemic preparedness plan so that America isn't caught flat-footed when a new pandemic comes again—as it will—next month, I'm also going to release the plan in greater detail.</p>, <p>So let me close with this: We have so—we've made so much progress during the past 7 months of this pandemic. The recent increases in vaccinations in August already are having an impact in some States where case counts are dropping in recent days. Even so, we remain at a critical moment, a critical time. We have the tools. Now we just have to finish the job with truth, with science, with confidence, and together as one Nation.</p>, <p>Look, we're the United States of America. There's nothing—not a single thing—we're unable to do if we do it together. So let's stay together.</p>, <p>God bless you all and all those who continue to serve on the frontlines of this pandemic. And may God protect our troops.</p>, <p>Get vaccinated.</p>]"
10,1,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks at a White House Labor Day Celebration,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-white-house-labor-day-celebration,"[<p>Jocelyn, thank you. Please. Please, please, please. Thank you, Jocelyn.</p>, <p>Please, sit down. Thank you. I—nothing to it, is there, Jocelyn? Just walking in and stand at the podium and—[<i>laughter</i>]—speaking at the White House. Nothing to it. You did a great job. And thank you. And thank you.</p>, <p>Before I really begin, I want to say that I think one of the biggest things that's changed is—my dear mother, God bless her soul, used to say, ""Out of everything bad, something good will come if you look hard enough for it.""</p>, <p>And I think one of the good things that's come out of this God-awful crisis regarding COVID is, ordinary people who never thought about the technician at the drugstore, never thought about the grocery store worker, never thought about what that firefighter has to do when they go in. They don't ask, ""Do you have COVID or not?"" Never thought about the people who keep this country up and running before.</p>, <p>I really mean this sincerely. It's not a political—it's a reality. And I think people went, ""Whoa, whoa."" And instead of—which was a good thing—banging pots and pans when people came back from rescuing other folks, I think they began to realize, ""You know, this is part of the deal."" And to use my dad's expression—and I mean it sincerely—and some—a few of you knew my dad—he said, ""Everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity."" And that's what the labor union is all about: dignity. It provides dignity for people who deserve to be treated differently.</p>, <p>And I want to thank Jocelyn, and I want to thank President Shuler, Madam President. And I know you didn't expect to be in this role at this moment, but as I told you before, I believe that the future of American labor is in very good hands. I really mean it. Thank you.</p>, <p>And I want to welcome everyone to the White House. And I really mean that. This is your house. It's not hyperbole. It's a fact. This is your house. I wouldn't be here without you. That's, again, not hyperbole.</p>, <p>In my White House, you'll always be welcome. You'll always be welcome. Labor will always be welcome. You know, you've heard me say many times: I intend to be the most pro-union President leading the most pro-union administration in American history. But I think one of the reasons I'm able to do that is the public is changing too. You've changed the public; you've educated them a lot.</p>, <p>I want to thank the dues-paying members of the Laborers, Marty—[<i>laughter</i>]—Marty Walsh, who's helping make sure that we keep the commitments across our entire Government.</p>, <p>And before I go any further, I'd like to pause for a moment of silence to honor the hundreds of union workers and essential workers who have died from COVID-19; and to honor a buddy, John Sweeney, who we lost earlier this year, and to honor a truly dear friend, Rich Trumka.</p>, <p>A moment of silence, please.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, a moment of silence was observed.</i>]</p>, <p>Thank you. This is real.</p>, <p>One of the things I admired about Rich is that he understood what people in this economy are really facing. He, like most of you, felt it in his bones. He understood what had happened to workers in this country, like you do. I've got to know a lot of you really, really well. You just feel it. You taste it. You understand it.</p>, <p>I get kidded by my staff for—all these years, and I say: I trust the person most who arrives at the right decision when it starts in their gut, it goes to their heart, and then they have the ability to articulate it because they—it goes to the brain. They're the ones that never back down. They're the ones that stay with you. The ones who arrive at it intellectually are the ones that are the ones who first—I welcome that, but they're not the ones who will stay to the end.</p>, <p>And you know, Rich understood the past and the challenges, like so many of you who lived and led through these moments. But he also understood the future. I think he understood who built this country and the tools that were needed to build it back and build it back better.</p>, <p>You've heard me say it a hundred times: We're the only country in the world that goes into a crisis and, when we come out of it, we're stronger than before we went in it. That's by building back better. We're going to build back better. We have to. We must. We will. Because that's who we are. That's what America is.</p>, <p>On Labor Day, we honor the dignity of the American worker. And every day, we remember that America wasn't built by Wall Street. They're not all bad folks out on Wall Street. I'm not suggesting that. But they didn't build America. It was built by the middle class, and unions built the middle class.</p>, <p>You gave workers a voice, all the way back from my great-grandfather Blewitt who was a mining engineer, back in the days of the Molly Maguires and all the way—and folks who were treated in Northeast Pennsylvania, in the coalmines. You gave people a voice. Molly Maguires was—they were a little tougher. [<i>Laughter</i>] You gave them a hard time, and you ended up on the doorstep, in a bag.</p>, <p>But you know, think about it: What are the basic things—my dad used to say, ""You know, we just thought it would give people ability to just be able to take a deep breath, have a little bit of breathing room."" And what are those things? Well, health care; a pension, God willing; higher wages and a safer workplace; and protections against discrimination and harassment. That's not asking too much.</p>, <p>We fundamentally transformed how we live and how we work in this country. The reason we have is because of the victories won by labor. I'm going to be a bit repetitive: the 8-hour day; the weekend; you know, time and a half for overtime; safety standards; sick days—victories for all of us. Because, I might add, you know, I noticed, when you all do that, everybody benefits—[<i>laughter</i>]—whether they belong to a union or not. [<i>Applause</i>] Whether they belong to a union or not.</p>, <p>When unions win, workers across the board win. That's a fact. Families win, community wins, America wins. We grow. And despite this, workers have been getting cut out of the deal for too long a time.</p>, <p>You know, from 1948, after the war, to 1979, productivity in America increased by more than 100 percent while the pay for American workers grew by nearly 100 percent. And then along came 1979, and everything began to change. Productivity in the country has grown almost four times faster than pay since 1979.</p>, <p>That means the workers have been giving much more to their employers' bottom lines than they've gotten back in their paychecks, breaking the basic bargain of this country. The bargain was: If you work hard and you contribute to the welfare of the outfit you work with, you got to share in the benefits. Well, that stopped for a long time. So you can carve out your piece of the middle class and make it a possibility. That's what got taken away for a lot of people.</p>, <p>Instead, some people started seeing the stock market and corporate profits and executive pay as the only measure for our economic growth. By the way, the stock market has gone up exponentially since I've been President. You haven't heard me say a word about it. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm glad it's gone up. No problem.</p>, <p>But look, let me tell you something: My measure of economic success is how families, like mine growing up—working families busting their neck—how they're doing; whether they have a little breathing room; whether they have a job that delivers some dignity, a paycheck they can support a family on.</p>, <p>In an economy—you know, in the economy my administration is building, instead of workers competing with each other for the jobs that are scarce, everybody is mad at me, because now—guess what?—employers are competing to attract workers, having to raise pay.</p>, <p>No, I'm serious. Think about it. That kind of competition in the market helps workers earn higher wages. It also gives them the power to demand dignity and respect in the workplace. Simply put, worker power is essential to building our economy back better than before—it's just that basic—to counter corporate power, to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. I'm so tired of trickle-down.</p>, <p>I ask, ""When has the middle class done better that the wealthy haven't done incredibly well?"" I can't think of a time that all the—when the middle class is booming and moving, everybody does well.</p>, <p>And to give workers even more power, I also signed an Executive order to improve competition in the economy, including calling for a ban on noncompete agreements that deny workers the right to change the job in the same field, even when there's no real reason for a company to stop them. It was all about suppressing wages. That's what it was about.</p>, <p>In Congress—when Congress passed the 1935 Labor Relations Act, it didn't just say you can have unions—it should be allowed. That's how it's kind of viewed for a long time. It said that we, the Government, should encourage unions and collective bargaining, making it easier. That's what it said.</p>, <p>And I believe every worker should have a free and fair choice to join a union. The law guarantees that choice. That belongs to workers, not to their employers or to special interests.</p>, <p>That's why I signed an Executive order creating a White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Employment [Empowerment],* to facilitate that choice whenever and wherever we can. Look, I want to thank Vice President Harris and Secretary Walsh—Marty—for leading that Task Force. That's why I want to see Congress pass the PRO Act and send it to my desk immediately. That's why I want us to extend organizing and collective bargaining rights to State and local government employees, like transit workers, first responders, health care workers, and other essential workers. And guess what? The public seems to agree with that as well.</p>, <p>Government should never be a barrier to workers organizing. It's government's job to remove those barriers. But it's up to workers to make the choice whether to organize or not, whether to form a union or not. And we need to help them understand why that can be the right choice for them.</p>, <p>We know the economic reasons: Union members get higher wages, better benefits, like health insurance and paid leave, protections against discrimination and harassment, and a safer and healthier workplace.</p>, <p>But there's another reason, a basic American reason: Workers who join unions gain power, power over the decisions and the decision makers that affect their lives. Workers' voices are heard and heeded. In a simple word, a union means there is democracy. Democracy. Organizing, joining a union, that's democracy in action. And it's about dignity on the job. But it's also about creating good jobs.</p>, <p>When I came to office, our first job was to stop the economic bleeding, and it was the worst bleeding since Roosevelt. We passed the American Rescue Plan. That delivered shots in arms and checks in pockets and provided that extra breathing room for working families. It helped State and cities keep essential workers on the job, including educators, police officers, firefighters, sanitation workers.</p>, <p>And thanks to the part of the Rescue Plan named for Ohio labor leader Butch Lewis, over a million retirees and workers across the country, they can trust that the pensions they worked for and sacrificed to secure will be there for them.</p>, <p>You know, and with the bipartisan agreement we've reached to rebuild America's infrastructure, we're going to be putting hundreds of thousands of people to work, including plumbers, pipefitters, electrical workers, steel workers, so many other union workers—modernizing roads, bridges, water systems, broadband systems; capping abandoned oil and gas wells that are leaking—over 100,000 of them—making the same salary as digging that well.</p>, <p>It creates jobs for American workers and makes our cities and towns more resilient and better able to meet the climate crisis. And to keep those jobs here at home, when your government spends the taxpayer's dollar, it's going to buying American goods, made in America, by American workers. Look, over the years, the Buy America [American]* Act became a hollow promise. It's been there for a long time. I'm going to make it a reality.</p>, <p>The next stop—the next stop—is dealing with the ability to pass the rest of my Build Back Better agenda, once-in-a-generation investments in our people: making housing more affordable; bringing down the cost of prescription drugs by giving Medicare the power to negotiate for lower prices—and you ought to thank Bernie Sanders for a lot of this; making eldercare and childcare more affordable while improving the pay for homecare workers and childcare workers; providing paid family leave and medical leave so that no worker is forced to choose between their job and their caregiving responsibilities.</p>, <p>You've all fought for all these things. We got to make them available to every—provide 2 years of free, university [universal],* high-quality pre-K, and high-quality pre-K—2 years that are needed. It shows that if you send a kid to school at age 3, 4, and 5, they increase by 56 percent the possibility they'll—no matter what the background—that they'll go through school all 12 years and do well.</p>, <p>And when I asked—you know, in the Obama administration, I was asked to find out from the CEOs of the Fortune 500 what they most wanted, what they most needed, what was their greatest concern. And over—I think it was—don't hold me to the exact number—348 or -47; I can't remember the number we got to—said the single most important thing is they needed a better educated public.</p>, <p>But guess what? They weren't paying for it. [<i>Laughter</i>] And guess what? Does anybody think if we were starting off from scratch, setting up public education, we'd say 12 years was enough for the 21st century?</p>, <p>So, look, we have to invest in high-quality job training and apprenticeships in fast-growing sectors; compete to give middle class families a well-deserved tax cut for daycare and health care; and provide a significant monthly tax cut for working families with children. That's what it is. Everybody talks about my child tax credit; it is a tax cut for ordinary folks. That's what it is.</p>, <p>And, as part of that, I want us to see us finally—finally—provide ""Dreamers,"" TPS recipients, farmworkers, essential workers a pathway to citizenship, bringing them out of the shadows so they can receive the protection and representation that our laws and our unions provide.</p>, <p>Folks, we're making progress. Our economy has added 750,000 jobs a month on average during the past 3 months since I've been here. Over—there are more than 4 million jobs since I took office. In the first half of this year, our economy grew fast—at a fastest rate in 40 years. Unemployment is down. My Build Back Better investments are going to allow us to keep and progress and move further in the years to come.</p>, <p>I just want to add one more thought in closing. While the pandemic has prevented me from traveling as much as I'd like, I've had a chance to meet with many of your brothers and sisters and many of you: the proud UAW members building cars and trucks in Pennsylvania and Michigan, and noting that the main—the Big Three have decided that, along with the support of those unions, they're building—going electric so we own that market.</p>, <p>Steelworkers in Portsmouth, Virginia. I've met with longshoremen and firefighters in Columbus. AFSCME workers in Allentown. IBEW workers and ironworkers and nurses and grocery store workers in Cincinnati. Plumbers and gasfitters in Maryland. AFT teachers in Virginia.</p>, <p>And by the way, of course I sleep with an NEA member every night. Same one. [<i>Laughter</i>] Same one. Jill had her first day of full-time teaching yesterday, this year. She's back to school.</p>, <p>And look, I've talked with union transit workers, machinists, laborers, and welders in Wisconsin. We've had Teamsters here in the White House. And always—the Teamsters always have my back. And, last week, I met with the first responders in New Orleans. And on Monday, I dropped by some of the IBEW linemen in Delaware helping recover from the Hurricane Ida.</p>, <p>You know, in the—the last year has taught us anything, it's what's essential. And what's essential is you. Not a joke. You and your union members. Wall Street could go on strike, but if, all of a sudden, the middle of this Ida, every IBEW member resigned, we'd be in real trouble.</p>, <p>I say that to make a generic point. I think we significantly underestimate—and I think even you guys sometimes underestimate—the incredible value you bring to the safety, security, and growth of the economy. You know, you're America's heart, and you're America's soul. And we all need to fight as hard for them and work as hard for them as we can.</p>, <p>And I want to say, the press was very, very—not just the press—a lot of people were very, very skeptical that when I was talking about we had to deal with the environment, that labor would never help.</p>, <p>Well, guess what? Labor is the reason it's working. Labor stepped up. Because they—you all understand. And I made a promise, and I'll keep it—that what we're talking about here is: When you think of global warming, you think of jobs—jobs—all the jobs we're going to create—making us, once again, the fastest growing—we are now—the most competitive economy in the world.</p>, <p>So, folks, you do it all. I'm sorry to go on so long, but I can't thank you enough for all you've done for the country and what you've done for me over my career. You've educated me. You brought me along. And you've always been there.</p>, <p>Now, I'm supposed to stop and walk out of the room here. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm going to stop. But with your permission, I'm going to walk into the room because I want to say hello to all of you.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>]"

10,3,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the Hurricane Ida Response Efforts During a Tour of Damaged Areas in New York City,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-hurricane-ida-response-efforts-during-tour-damaged-areas-new-york-city,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Chuck, thank you very much. As that old joke goes, if my father were here, he'd say, ""Thank you."" If my mother were here, she'd say, ""Who are you talking about?"" [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Look, folks, let me begin by saying I wish every American could walk down this alley with me to see and talk to the people who have been devastated. Just talk to them. None of them were shouting or complaining. Every one of them were thanking me as if it was something special—I mean this sincerely—that I was here and hoped that we'd be able to do something.</p>, <p>This is America, where I'm standing right now. These are the people, whether it was in Scranton or Claymont or anywhere around the world—the country—who built this country. And it's about time we step up. They're always the first ones that are hurt and the last ones that are helped. But that's not going to happen this time.</p>, <p>The group I have standing with me, led by Chuck Schumer and your—Congresswoman, is this your district?</p>, <p><i>Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer.</i> Grace Meng.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, it's Grace's district. No, it's——</p>, <p><i>Representative Grace Meng.</i> AOC. Alex.</p>, <p><i>Leader Schumer.</i> Ocasio-Cortez.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I want to thank her personally for her gumption, the way she's fought and hollered and fought so hard for all the people in this alley. I really mean it. Thank you, thank you, thank you. But that goes for everybody here.</p>, <p>And look, folks—you know, I want to thank the Governor for—and Leader Schumer and Kirsten—I shouldn't—I should say, Senator Gillibrand, and Congresswoman Meng and Maloney and Meeks and Mayor de Blasio for being here.</p>, <p>You know, it's not—how can I say this? Sometimes, some very bad things happen that have a tendency to bring out the best in a people and a country. And I think what people are seeing across this country—from the wildfires in California and the far West, which I'm heading to in a couple of days; all the way to down in Louisiana, the Gulf, where I was a couple of days ago; to New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, to a lesser extent; Delaware, to a lesser extent; and New York—people are beginning to realize this is much, much bigger than anyone was willing to believe. And a whole segment of our population denying this thing called climate change.</p>, <p><i>Leader Schumer.</i> Right.</p>, <p><i>Participant.</i> Right.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> But I really mean it.</p>, <p>Sometimes, my mother used to say, ""Out of everything bad, something good will come if you look hard enough for it."" Well, I think we've all seen—even the climate skeptics are seeing—that this really does matter.</p>, <p>And it's not just whether or not people who are just trying to get by in these homes, in these alleys here, working their butts off, do well; it's people in high towers along the shore who find that as this rain and all this change takes place in the groundwater, the buildings are actually beginning to tilt, hundred-story buildings. This goes so far beyond what anybody is willing to speak to up to now.</p>, <p>We just finished surveying some of the damage in the neighborhood here in Queens. And earlier today, we were in the Raritan Valley in New Jersey, which also got badly, badly hit. Walking these neighborhoods, meeting the families and the first responders, seeing how folks are doing after this destruction and pain and another devastating storm, is an eye opener. The people who stand on the other side of the fences who don't live there, who are yelling that we're talking about interfering with free enterprise by doing something about climate change—they don't live there.</p>, <p><i>Participant.</i> That's right. That's right.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> They don't live—they don't understand.</p>, <p>And you know, last week, right here, in so many other communities, these waves crashed through the streets here, testing the aging infrastructure and taking lives. More lives were taken here than down in Louisiana. Let me say that again: They had over 20 inches of rain. They had 178-mile-an-hour winds—gusts. And more lives were taken here than down in Louisiana.</p>, <p><i>Leader Schumer.</i> Basement apartment.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And you know, you all saw the harrowing images of—stories and families trapped in flooding basements and struggling to survive. Well, you didn't have to—just go along this Valley, talk to the people. I'm sure the press has done that.</p>, <p>My message to everyone grappling with this devastation is, we're here. We're not going home until this gets done. I really mean that. We're not leaving. We're going to continue to shout as long as it takes to get real progress here.</p>, <p>Folks—and we have to take some bold action now——</p>, <p><i>Leader Schumer.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> ——to tackle the accelerating effects of climate. If we don't act now—I'm going to be heading, as Chuck knows, as the Senator knows—I'm going to be heading from here to Glasgow, in Scotland, for the COP meeting, which is all the nations of the world getting together to decide what we're going to do about climate change.</p>, <p>And John Kerry, the former Secretary of State, is leading our effort, putting it together. We are determined—we are determined—that we are going to deal with climate change, end—have zero emissions—net emissions by 2050. By 2020 [2050],* make sure all our electricity is zero emissions. We're going to be able to do these things, but we've got to move. We've got to move. And we've got to move the rest of the world. It's not just the United States of America.</p>, <p>And so, folks, this summer alone, communities with over 100 million Americans—100 [million]* American—Americans call home, have been struck by extreme weather. One in every three Americans has been victimized by severe weather, the hurricanes along the Gulf, the East Coast, up through this community. And I saw the human and physical costs firsthand, as I said, in Louisiana.</p>, <p>But, Governor, you called; Phil Murphy, so many of the leading—Governor Murphy—so many leading with urgency and action are—said, ""Enough. Enough."" And there's not a single request I'm aware of—there may be something—that we haven't signed off on—that we haven't signed off yet.</p>, <p>And here's the deal: The New York Fire Department and the New York Police Department, the Sanitation Department, and other first responders, they're leading with incredible, incredible courage. Two linemen have been killed—trying to make sure we have——</p>, <p><i>Leader Schumer.</i> Bless those fellas.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And, folks, the evidence is clear: Climate change poses an existential threat to our lives, to our economy. And the threat is here; it's not going to get any better. The question: Can it get worse? We can stop it from getting worse.</p>, <p>And when I talk about building back better—and Chuck is fighting for my program—our program—on the Hill—when I talk about building back better, I mean, you can't build to what it was before this last storm. You've got to build better, so if the storm occurred again, there would be no damage—there would be.</p>, <p>But that's not going to stop us though. Because if we just do that, it's just going to get worse and worse and worse, because the storms are going to get worse and worse and worse.</p>, <p>And so, folks, we've got to listen to the scientists and the economists and the national security experts. They all tell us this is code red; the Nation and the world are in peril. And that's not hyperbole. That is a fact. They've been warning us the extreme weather would get more extreme over the decade, and we're living it in real time now.</p>, <p>Or we can look around the wreckage and the ruins and the heartbreak from so many communities, to feel it. Just don't understand, you can feel it; you can taste it; you can see it. Precious lives lost in Louisiana, in New Jersey, in New York. Families living in shelters. Subway stations flooded. Decaying infrastructure pushed beyond the limits. Lives and livelihoods interrupted once again.</p>, <p>We're working closely with the Governors and mayors and Members of Congress and community leaders.</p>, <p>On Sunday, I immediately approved the disaster declaration of Governor Hochul to rush Federal assistance to where it was needed here.</p>, <p>FEMA——</p>, <p><i>Governor Kathleen C. Hochul of New York.</i> Thank you, President.<i> </i>Thank you, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> FEMA is working——</p>, <p><i>Leader Schumer.</i> Fastest ever.</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>——intensively with State and local officials, assessing the damage and mobilizing resources.</p>, <p>One of things I want to thank Chuck for, as leader of the Senate: He has helped mobilize State, local, and Federal. When they're all working together, that's when things happen positively.</p>, <p>The Health and Human Services Secretary is working with the state to ensure folks on Medicare and Medicaid get the emergency care if they need it. They're going to make sure it's equitable so that the hardest hit, including lower income folks——</p>, <p><i>Leader Schumer.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>——communities of color, and the elderly, and the most vulnerable get help and get it first. They are the ones in the greatest need.</p>, <p>And there's much to be done. And we're working around the clock on all these critical needs in areas.</p>, <p>Look, I say to anyone who could hear this or if this is broadcast: If you need help, please go to disasterassistance.gov or call 1-800-621-FEMA, 1-800-621-3362. We can get you help now. We can get you help now. And I know these disasters aren't going to stop; they're only going to come with more frequency and ferocity.</p>, <p>And as I said, I'm working in Congress to pass two important pieces of legislation——</p>, <p><i>Leader Schumer.</i> Aww, yes.</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>——that this man here is honchoing through the Congress for me: the bipartisan plan to modernize our physical infrastructure: our roads, our bridges, our power transmission, our distribution lines. How many bridges I just went through in New Jersey that had been overflowed by the river. The river has gone higher than the bridges, having done damage to them.</p>, <p>My Build Back Better plan, with key investments in—to fight climate change, cutting emissions, and make things more resilient. Each dollar we invest, every dollar we raise—a city block by 2 feet, flood-proof power stations, sanitations, reduction in the buildup of kindling in our forest, installing electrical lines underground rather than overhead—saves us $6 for every single dollar we spend to do those things.</p>, <p>Because the next time disaster strikes, the flood is contained, the fire doesn't spread as wisely [widely],* and power stays on, not to mention those investments save lives, homes, and create good-paying union jobs. [<i>Applause</i>]</p>, <p><i>Leader Schumer.</i> Yay!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I hosted——</p>, <p><i>Leader Schumer.</i> We like union jobs.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I hosted 56 heads of state in Washington. And I pointed out—we're talking about climate change, and I said: ""I think of one word when I think of climate change—jobs. Good-paying jobs."" Each of these things requires a good-paying job. Not $7 or $12 or $15, but $45, $50 an hour, plus health care. That's what is needed.</p>, <p>And so, folks, it will also—and Wall Street, not too far from here, acknowledges if we spend the money on these things, we're going to grow the economy, increase employment.</p>, <p><i>Leader Schumer.</i> Yes!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> You know, the fire in Oregon sent smokes all—sent smoke all the way to the Atlantic. A storm in the Gulf, as you've now figured out, can reverberate 10 States away. Supply chains and crop production get interrupted, driving up costs, devastating industries all over America. This is everybody's crisis—everybody's crisis.</p>, <p>Now, let me just say again: The fact is that the damage done on the West Coast—which I'll be heading to—they've already burned 5 million acres to the ground. That's bigger than the State of New Jersey, if I'm not mistaken. Five million acres. And you see it by the smoke that ends up coming over the East Coast.</p>, <p>Folks, we're all in this. It's about time we stopped the regional fights and understand helping somebody make sure there's no—fewer fires in the West warrants helping people in this alley make sure they're not flooded.</p>, <p>And by the way, it's not just the flooding—and I'll end with this. It's not just the flooding. Flooding ends up overrunning sanitation systems, and it causes disease, and people get sick. And it's serious, serious business.</p>, <p>So we've got a lot of work to do. Again, it's good-paying jobs; we can put the economy back on the path to real growth. But in the meantime, we're going to save a whole hell of a lot of people's lives, and we're going to save a whole hell of a lot of money.</p>, <p>God bless you all. Let's get this done.</p>, <p><i>Leader Schumer.</i> Mr. President, look at that nice kid with the American flag. Say hello.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> How are you, pal?</p>, <p><i>Leader Schumer.</i> What's your name? He can't hear us.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> How old are you?</p>, <p><i>Child.</i> Seven.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, you're getting old!</p>, <p>And by the way, the neat thing about America: Every time we end up with a problem going into a serious circumstance, we come out better than we went in. That's because we're so diverse. That's America. Be proud of it. Thank you. And don't jump. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right. Thanks, thanks.</p>]"
10,4,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks During a Briefing on Hurricane Ida Response Efforts in Hillsborough, New Jersey",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-during-briefing-hurricane-ida-response-efforts-hillsborough-new-jersey,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Well, thanks, Gov. Thank you. Wish I were here under different circumstances, but you really took a hit, and New Jersey took a hit; parts of my State as well, but New Jersey and New York in particular.</p>, <p>And I want to begin by thanking Senator Booker for all the work he's doing in the Senate trying to get this infrastructure and other—the things we have to do to not just build back, but build back better than it was before.</p>, <p>And I want to thank Representative Watson and—now, am I in your district or am I in—I'm in Tommy's district——</p>, <p><i>Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman.</i> You'll be in my district in a moment.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> In a moment. Okay. We're right on the line.</p>, <p><i>Representative Tomasz P. Malinowski.</i> We're all one district.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I think that's true. And you also have one of the best State police forces in the Nation. I'm a big statey guy, and so is Delaware. But thank you very much for all you do.</p>, <p>Look, to the local officials, the mayors, and the county commissioner: You really get hit first. They come to you first. They want to know what's going on, what you can do to help them. And, in some cases, even with search-and-rescue, you have some of the least reach in terms of availability of resources.</p>, <p>And the one thing I will say—and I really want to thank my FEMA Director. She's done one thing that—and we had a great FEMA Director in the past as well—that makes it work. When you get local, State, and Federal working together, it is more than three times—it's like 10 times—what it would be if just having one moving.</p>, <p>And the losses that we witnessed today are profound: dozens of lost lives; homes destroyed in Manville, including by gas leaks triggered by the flooding; damaged infrastructure, including the rail system. And my thoughts are with all those families affected by the storms and all those families who lost someone they love.</p>, <p>I understand there are still two—is it two people missing? Or—-—</p>, <p><i>Governor Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey.</i> Four.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Four people still missing. And I especially want to thank—and it's an overused phrase, but the brave first responders. I—you know, we have—you have exemplified the courage, both in New Jersey and next door in New York. You've—they've done an incredible job.</p>, <p>And we're working closely with Governor Murphy, and we're going to continue to do so. I'm here to see firsthand what the damage is and find out directly from you all what is most needed.</p>, <p>Now, look, FEMA has been, I hope, as responsive as we've intended them to be, and I'm sure they have. A hundred and thirty-two personnel from FEMA, so far, including Federal search-and-rescue teams, including 60 individuals; Incident Management Assistant Teams of 20 people to support these response operations; and Mobile Emergency Response Support teams—six of them—to provide communications and logistics support.</p>, <p>And on Sunday, when the Governor—and we spoke to the Governor and he asked for the major disaster declaration, we made it available immediately so that we could speed Federal assistance as quickly as we could to hard-hit communities.</p>, <p>The FEMA Administrator was on the ground here in New Jersey yesterday, I believe, to assess the damage. She's visited two communities, Mullica Hills and Wenonah, hit by the tornado, as—that was on the ground just—what?—for over 13 miles that was on the ground, that tornado—those tornados.</p>, <p>The HHS Secretary has worked with the State to make sure folks on Medicare, Medicaid get the emergency care they need now. And we're going to make sure the relief is equitable so that those hardest hit get what they need. And they—and we know there's a lot more to do, and that's why we're here.</p>, <p>For decades, scientists have warned of extreme—weather would be more extreme and climate change was here, and we're living through it now. We don't have any more time.</p>, <p>I hope no one—I've been on the telephone or on the road an awful lot between California, Idaho, New Orleans—excuse me, not New Orleans—Louisiana, but in New Orleans—Mississippi and, you know, here. I mean, every part of the country—every part of the country—is getting hit by extreme weather. And we're now living in real time what the country is going to look like. And if we don't do something—we can't turn it back very much, but we can prevent it from getting worse.</p>, <p>And so we're all in this together, and we've got to make sure that we don't leave any community behind. And it's all across the country. You know, the Members of Congress know from their colleagues in Congress that, you know, the—what looks like a tornado—they don't call them that anymore—that hit the crops and wetlands in the middle of the country, in Iowa, in Nevada, and—I mean, it's just across the board.</p>, <p>And you know, as I said, we're in this together. And so one of the things that, today, I'm going to ask you about when we get into this—some question and answers here—is about how we're going to build back realizing what the status of the climate is now, what the trajectory of it is going to be.</p>, <p>And we can no longer—we all know—we can't just build back to what it was before. Whatever damage done in New Jersey, you can't build back and restore it, what it was before, because another tornado, another 10 inches of rain is going to produce the same kind of results.</p>, <p>So I want to talk a little bit about the specifics about the things you think you would need not just to get back to normal, but to get back to a place where, if it happened again, the damage would be considerably less. That's what this is all about, in my view. This is an opportunity. I think the country has finally acknowledged the fact that global warming is real and it's moving at an incredible pace, and we've got to do something about it.</p>, <p>I'm going to be going from here to what—COP29 [COP26]* in Glasgow for the world meeting together and how we're going to deal with climate change. And it is—it's—I think we're at one of those inflection points where we either act, or we're going to be in real, real trouble. Our kids are going to be in real trouble.</p>, <p>So I want to thank you, and I yield back to you, Gov.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Murphy.</i> Thank you, Mr. President. Amen to all. And again, we can't thank you enough for being here, for all your support.</p>, <p>Another person who we're going to hear from next has been there for us. And Deanne Criswell, who's the Administrator for FEMA, we've had a lot of conversations over the past several weeks, harking back to Henri, which also wreaked some havoc in New Jersey, but nothing like Ida.</p>, <p>Madam Administrator, it's an honor to have you here.</p>, <p><i>Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Bennett Criswell.</i> Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Governor. And thank you to all the elected officials, commissioners, and mayors that are here today.</p>, <p>I'd actually like to start by giving a big shout-out to all of the first responders that have been supporting the lifesaving efforts over the last few days, many of them in your own communities, many of them who have had damages to their own homes. And I just want everybody to know: The hard work that you do is really appreciated at—you know, in your communities, but also at the Federal level as well. We couldn't do it without you. You're the ones on the ground. I always say it, and you've heard from others as well: Disasters always start and end local, and so we want to make sure that we're here to support the first responders.</p>, <p>I did spend yesterday visiting some of the damaged areas and meeting with local officials. I toured Mullica Hill and Wenonah and witnessed firsthand the destruction that these tornadoes did bring.</p>, <p>But because of the President's swift action in declaring a major disaster declaration, we've been able to now provide aid to some of the families who have been impacted, specifically those individuals that live in Bergen, Gloucester—excuse me if I get these wrong—pronounce them wrong—Hunterdon, Middlesex, Passaic, and Somerset. And——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> It's okay as long as you send the money.</p>, <p><i>Administrator Criswell.</i> I'm sending money. [<i>Laughter</i>] I bring a checkbook, Mr. President, that you gave me.</p>, <p>And we're continuing to do damage assessments today. So I have staff on the ground today that are doing assessments in Essex, Hudson, Union, and Mercer. And you know, we wanted to be able to get this disaster declaration in place quickly, knowing that we still needed to do additional damage assessments, to really get a better understanding of the scope of the impact that the communities are experiencing across New Jersey.</p>, <p>[<i>Administrator Criswell continued her remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>And so, if you don't have an emergency plan, please go to ready.gov, and there's some great information there to help you prepare for what you may be experiencing in the future.</p>, <p>Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Governor.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Murphy.</i> Thank you. Thank you, Deanne. Thank you for the major disaster declaration for those six counties, including this one, and for your work to, hopefully, add to that list. I know your team is on that.</p>, <p>Again, it's disasterassistance.gov if you're in those six counties. If you're not in the six counties, we have a website set up—NJ.gov/Ida—and, hopefully, that's a landing place for now for folks to go until—please, God—they get designated as a disaster county. So thank you for everything. You all have been extraordinary.</p>, <p>We're in Somerset County, and we're honored to have the commissioner director with us, an outstanding leader. Hear a few words from Shanel Robinson. Shanel.</p>, <p><i>Commissioner Director Shanel Y. Robinson of Somerset County, NJ.</i> Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Governor. And welcome, to all of you, to Somerset County's Emergency Operations Center. And thank you for visiting to see the catastrophic damage that Ida brought firsthand.</p>, <p>[<i>Commissioner Director Robinson continued her remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>So, again, thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Governor. And thank you to all of you for your resiliency and for your deep concern for not only Somerset County, but the State of New Jersey, and your commitment to our recovery.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you, Shanel.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Murphy.</i> Thank you, Shanel. Great leadership by you and your team, as you said, at the county and local level, and heroism all over the state by first responders.</p>, <p>With your blessing, Mr. President, I think we have one more speaker before our friends in the press leave, and that is the superintendent of our state police, Colonel Pat Callahan, who has been there every single day during this pandemic and certainly through Ida and all the other weather challenges we've had.</p>, <p>Pat, over to you.</p>, <p><i>New Jersey State Police Superintendent Colonel Patrick J. Callahan.</i> Thank you, Governor, for that introduction and certainly for your continued leadership through probably some of the most challenging times in New Jersey's history.</p>, <p>And thank you, Mr. President, especially for your kind words about the State police. Delaware State Police is pretty good too, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> The best. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Superintendent Callahan.</i> But your presence here sends a strong message to all of us and to our residents that that support—from not only response, to recovery, mitigation—that the Federal Government is here, and that we saw that yesterday when the Administrator and I walked around and spoke to those homeowners. So thank you.</p>, <p>And I also want to take this opportunity to thank and offer my gratitude for the swift offers of assistance that we got from the White House, from FEMA, Department of Defense, HHS. It's an honor to stand shoulder to shoulder with all of you and show the rest of the country what it means to be a true collaborative effort here. So thank you.</p>, <p>And just a little bit about the day of the storm, Mr. President: That morning of, at 10 a.m., we hosted a call with the National Weather Service, all of our county OEM coordinators, our State emergency management partners. We activated our SEOC 2 hours later. And then, in short order, that unprecedented amount of rainfall just staggering rate fell and ravaged our State, upending families and causing a horrible loss of life, as you've heard.</p>, <p>To give a broad picture, very few areas were unscathed. Flooding occurred in 10 of our 21 counties that were normally not flood prone. And as we witnessed yesterday, that EF-3 that hit down on that 13-mile path, starting with—over in Harrison Township, all the way up through Wenonah and out.</p>, <p>So it—that all happened in a period of about 9 or 10 hours.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Superintendent Callahan.</i> Almost 3 months of rain in about 5 hours. Just unprecedented. The rivers exceeded their levels even today. The Passaic River is not expected to fall below flood stage until tomorrow. We might even be expecting some rain tomorrow, which we're keeping an eye on, as you could well know.</p>, <p>[<i>Superintendent Callahan continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>But having lived your life in our neighborhood, you know that we're a strong, resilient people and a tough State, and I—together, I know that we're going to get our families and our citizens back and forward from where we need to be.</p>, <p>So thank you, sir. It was an honor.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thank all your troopers for us too. We—for real.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Murphy.</i> Thank you. And it has to be said, Mr. President—and I think the mayors who we'll hear from in a minute—as the press, I think, with your blessing, are going to depart if I'm not—if I've got that right.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Okay.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Murphy.</i> Every loss of life is a tragedy, never mind 27—and four missing. But, literally, thousands of rescues——</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the press was escorted from the room, and the briefing continued.</i>]</p>]"

10,6,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks on Hurricane Ida Response Efforts During a Tour of Damaged Areas in LaPlace, Louisiana",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-hurricane-ida-response-efforts-during-tour-damaged-areas-laplace-louisiana,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Let me start off by thanking the folks here in this neighborhood for letting me come in and see what's going on. Councilman, thank you. Thank you for everything.</p>, <p>Folks, look, it's—I'm grateful for the Governor asking me to come on down to visit and to see what—visit. And I want to thank him for his leadership as well.</p>, <p>You know, we just came from an emergency operations center here in St. John's Parish. And we just walked this neighborhood. I'm going to finish walking it up that way as well. But the fact is that we—you know, there's a lot—we just—to see just exactly what's happened on the ground, see what's going on in people's homes.</p>, <p>A lot of people here, for example, because they don't have cell connections, are unaware of what available help there is right now to get them. The FEMA Director and I were just talking to them. We're going to make sure we have someone coming through here, going door to door, letting people know what's available to them right now, because they can't connect online.</p>, <p>And with the Governor and mayors and Members of Congress, community leaders, all the folks that are here, we've been working together to deliver millions of meals and liters of water.</p>, <p>And I know you all are frustrated about how long it takes to restore power. It's dangerous work. Twenty-five thousand linemen from around the country have come here to Louisiana to help; crews from 32 different States are helping. And two of them lost their lives in the process of trying to get power back up.</p>, <p>And we're going—we're working 24/7 with the energy companies who we met with the heads of today. And we're going to deploy even more Federal resources, including hundreds of generators—and there's more come—to restore power as fast as we possibly can, faster than anything that happened during Katrina.</p>, <p>And we're also working on the cell phone—with the cell phone companies so you can call your loved ones, call for help regardless of where you are, and make sure the people you know and you love, you haven't been able to talk to lately, be able to know whether they're okay.</p>, <p>We're moving quickly to keep gas flowing to the pumps, including—I've gone into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve—that's what's been set aside—the crude oil—providing flexibility for—and providing flexibility for how many hours truckers are able to drive and transport gas and fuel. Because there's a law in America: You can't drive, for safety reasons and beyond, so many hours a day. But we need more movement of this fuel. And we're expanding the supply of gasoline that can be sold in the State of Louisiana.</p>, <p>And there's much to be done. We're working around the clock with the Governor and the elected officials here until we can meet every need you all have.</p>, <p>In fact, reports suggest that some insurance companies may deny coverage for living assistance unless the homeowner was under a mandatory evacuation order. And so you paid your insurance premiums. You're supposed to get payments for additional living expenses in the case of an emergency. Well, but the insurance companies are saying: ""No, no. No, we won't pay you what we owe.""</p>, <p>Well, we're putting as much pressure as we can. We know all the parishes that issued strong ""voluntary"" evacuation orders at first, and many didn't have enough time to make that order ""mandatory,"" as the storm moved so fast. And you know, even with ""voluntary"" evacuations ordered, folks felt safest leaving their homes in many cases.</p>, <p>No one fled this killer storm because they were looking for a vacation or a road trip. So, folks, they left their home because they left it—they felt they had to flee the risk death. There's nothing ""voluntary"" about that.</p>, <p>And so I am calling on private insurance companies: Don't hide behind the fine print and a technicality. Pay what you owe your customers. Cover temporary housing costs in natural disasters, and help those in need. That's what we should all be doing now. And that's what we are doing.</p>, <p>So far, we have provided, with the Governor's help as well, $100 million in critical assistance directly to people in Louisiana by putting $500 in their bank accounts once they've contacted us. That's what we're going to come and let all you people know exactly how to do that; that will happen.</p>, <p>And secondly, as the Governor's request, FEMA is helping with—fancy phrase—transitional sheltering assistance, meaning a place for you to be safely able to sleep at night and be secure, like covering your hotel bill you racked up because you couldn't stay at home during the hurricane or because your home does—is not livable now.</p>, <p>We're making sure this kind of relief is equitable. For those hardest hit, the resources they need have to be—get to them. And so no matter who you are, if you live in an affected area, please visit disasterassistance.gov once you're able to use your cell phone, or call 1-800-621-F-E-M-A—FEMA. That's 1-800-621-3362.</p>, <p>And, folks, Hurricane Ida is another reminder that we need to be prepared for the next hurricane and superstorms that are going to come, and they're going to come more frequently and more ferociously.</p>, <p>I've been working closely with the Governor and our colleagues in Congress in both parties on my Build Back Better plan that will modernize our roads, our bridges, our water system, sewers and drainage systems, and power grids and transmission lines to make sure they're more resilient.</p>, <p>I walked through the backyards here—so many telephone lines are down. So many telephone poles are down. So many of the—of the way in which we transmit energy is lost because they're all wooden telephone poles. We know, for a fact, if they're underground, they're secure. It costs more money.</p>, <p>We've got to not just build back to what it was—put the same old poles up—we've got to build back better, we've got to build back more resiliently, and we've got to make sure we do the same thing across the board.</p>, <p>Think about how that $760 million West Shore project here in Southern Louisiana will build miles of new levees, pumping stations, and drainage structures to provide protection for 60,000 folks in the area. That will change their lives in future storms. I told the Governor that he has my full support—and I mean it sincerely—he has my full support to get this project done.</p>, <p>And, folks, I know you're hurting. I know you're hurting. I know the folks in Lake Charles, who I visited earlier this year, are still hurting from Hurricane Laura. I want you to know: We're going to be here for you. And with regard to Lake Charles, I've put in a request in the new—in the budget to provide for help for recovery for Lake Charles as a consequence of Laura and Delta—two storms that they still haven't been—gotten the needs that they—met that they have.</p>, <p>This isn't about being a Democrat or Republican. We're Americans, and we'll get through this together. We just got to remember: We not only have to build back, we have to build back better than it was before—better than it was before—so when another superstorm comes, it's not the damage done.</p>, <p>So thank you all very much. I'm going to see the rest of the folks in the neighborhood here.</p>, <p>But every time I'd walk out of my grandpop's house up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And my grandmother would yell, ""No, Joey, spread it."" Let's spread the faith. Okay? Let's get this done together.</p>, <p>Thank you. Thank you.</p>]"
10,7,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks During a Briefing on Hurricane Ida Response Efforts in LaPlace, Louisiana",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-during-briefing-hurricane-ida-response-efforts-laplace-louisiana,"[<p><i>White House Director of Public Engagement Cedric L. Richmond.</i> Let me thank everybody for coming here. I'm sure he doesn't need any introduction, but I just want to say it's good to be back, but, more importantly, the President wanted to get here as soon as, one, it wasn't a distraction and draining resources. So we're glad that the Governor assured us of that and invited us down.</p>, <p>But the President has been chomping at the bit to really make sure that recovery is going well and to make sure that he can see hands on.</p>, <p>But you don't need to hear from me. With that, I'll turn it over to the President.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, look, folks, you know, this storm has been incredible, not only here but all the way up the East Coast. I've been spending time with—in talking with the Governor a lot, but, in the meantime, also with Governors of my State of Delaware and Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York, where there are more deaths than you have here. I hope that doesn't change in terms of the number of lost lives.</p>, <p>And I have a daughter who went to Tulane. [<i>Laughter</i>] And she's a—runs a Boys and Girls Club operation, and she called me and said: ""Dad, when are you going—why are spending a time talking to the Governor of New York? Why are you not in Louisiana?"" [<i>Laughter</i>] So you've all got to write a note for me that I'm down, all right?</p>, <p>Look, you know, Cedric and the FEMA Administrator, we came because want to hear directly from you all what is—what specific problems you're dealing with.</p>, <p>We've been working with you on key areas to deliver more than 6.7 million meals and 6.1 million liters of water. But sometimes, what we deliver and what is needed aren't all the same thing. And we're frustrated, I know—you've got to be frustrated about the restoration of power. And I understand two gentlemen who run those two operations are working like hell. I think you've got about 25,000 linemen from around the country here. A couple have already given their life trying to get things going.</p>, <p>And so we're working 24/7 with the energy companies—I think they had to acknowledge that—to get the system up and moving. And we also deployed even more Federal resources, including hundreds of generators to restore power and faster than we were able to do in Katrina.</p>, <p>You know, it's dangerous work, as I said, and I want to thank those 25,000 linemen from 32 different States. They've always been—responded in big time.</p>, <p>We're also working with the phone companies so you can—you know, I think the worst thing in the world, having been there in a different circumstance, wanting to—you know, knowing things are terrible outside, where you're standing, and wondering how your son, daughter, mother, father, uncle, aunt, and how they're doing and not being able to get connected to them.</p>, <p>And so we're moving as—as fast as we can to be able to provide access, regardless who your provider was. If your provider's system went down, you'll be able to use any provider that's on there; you've just got to get online. So I hope that's picking up around the State as well. I'd like to hear more about that.</p>, <p>But—and we're moving as fast as we can to keep gas flowing in the pumps. I've authorized going into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And—but I know still, you know, there's work to do in this area. And we've instructed my team to have all hands on deck to make sure that that happens—that we have the, you know—and they're going to make this up—instead of us going to Exxon, kind of get back out there. And we're going to be able to work that through.</p>, <p>And, to date, we've also provided $100 million in direct assistance directly to folks in Louisiana, with that 500 bucks going into their bank accounts so that they can deal immediately with emergencies.</p>, <p>And I'd love to hear from you if you've heard anything—feedback from your constituents—about that at all. Because sometimes it's just that—what you need that moment, and it can make a difference.</p>, <p>And we also know there's a heck of a lot more work to do and—and that's why we're here today. And my message today is—I think what we're all seeing, and I'm getting the same response from my Republican friends here that are in the Congress: There's nothing political about this. It's just simply about saving lives and getting people back up and running.</p>, <p>And we're in this together, and so we're not going to leave any community behind: rural, city, coastal, inland. And I promise we're going to have your backs until this gets done.</p>, <p>And so I'm mainly here to listen, to see what's on your mind, and be able to ask a few questions. And if they're really hard questions I can't answer, I'll turn to Cedric or the Director. [<i>Laughter</i>] As you probably know about me, I'll have an opinion. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>At any rate, so thank you, thank you, thank you. I'll turn it back to you, Cedric, and let's see what we can do here.</p>, <p><i>Director Richmond.</i> Well, thank you, Mr. President. We'll turn it over to the Governor, who's leading the statewide recovery.</p>, <p>Governor Edwards.</p>, <p><i>Governor John Bel Edwards of Louisiana.</i> Thank you, Cedric, and welcome back home.</p>, <p>Mr. President, we appreciate you being in Louisiana today, and thank you for accepting the invitation.</p>, <p>[<i>Gov. Edwards continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>So investing in infrastructure, in resiliency, and making sure that we do things better and smarter, it does pay off, because this would be a much more expensive storm to recover from had we not already made those investments.</p>, <p>So we welcome you. We thank you for being here.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Can I say one thing, please? [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Well, hell, you know, once you represent a district, you never stop representing it. You know what I mean?</p>, <p><i>Director Richmond.</i> That's true.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> But you know, one of the things I hope you keep an eye on is—I mean, everybody to keep an eye on—is that, you know, I got, kind of—not beat up, but I got criticized from my talking—when I was running for office—we've got to Build Back Better.</p>, <p>Things have changed and so drastically in terms of the environment. We've already crossed certain thresholds. We can't build back a road, a highway, and a bridge or anything to what it was before. I mean, you've got to build back to what it is now—what's needed now.</p>, <p>And I know the head of the energy companies understand this really well. We have a significant piece of legislation, both the infrastructure bill and a budget thing—a reconciliation bill—that calls for significant investment in being able to deal with what is about to come.</p>, <p>In other words, for example, when you guys are putting back up those high-tension wires again—and that's working—you're not going to put up the same exact system. Your guys are going to have to build it better, and it's resiliency.</p>, <p>And so I just want you all focusing on—and as you take a look—and I'm going to presume to send you copies of this stuff—take a look and see if what we're—what we're suggesting makes enough sense to you. Not whether it's enough money or not or too much, but does it make sense. Does it make sense.</p>, <p>For example, coming in and seeing all the polls down. Well, you know, I mean, we're going to build back better. I mean, you know, we know if it's underground, it costs a hell of a lot more money, but guess what? It saves a hell of a lot more money long term.</p>, <p>And we know that the kind of stuff that goes across even—you saw the high-tension stuff going down across the Mississippi, like it did once in the Delaware River, which is a hell of a lot wider than the Mississippi River. It's—you know.</p>, <p>And so we have to—it seems to me we can save a whole lot of money and a whole lot of pain—pain for our constituents—if when we build back, we build it back in a better way.</p>, <p>And it will create—and I realize I'm selling as I'm talking too, but it will create really significant good-paying jobs. Not 15-dollar-an-hour jobs, but jobs of prevailing wage. And it generates economic growth.</p>, <p>But I just hope we don't go about deciding, just like—and you and I talked a lot about it—the levee system, and the one the Federal Government—that's the only one I'm fully familiar with. I mean, that was a lot of money. But think how much money it saved and how many lives it saved. So I hope you'll think about that.</p>, <p>With this—so when you hear the word ""resiliency""—and I know the energy guys know this—it's about making a system, from our transmission of energy straight through to the highways we're building and the bridges, resilient to the changes that we're taking—that we're seeing happen.</p>, <p>I'm sorry, I wanted to repeat that again. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I just hope you take a look at it and tell me if we need more or less too. That's what I——</p>, <p><i>Director Richmond.</i> Well, thank you, Mr. President. I think, with that, it's a great way to segue to our FEMA Administrator, Deanne Criswell.</p>, <p><i>Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne B. Criswell.</i> Thank you, Cedric. Mr. President, Governor, so far, you know, in addition to some of the numbers that you mention, we have about 1,200 responders from the Federal family on the ground, and that doesn't include those that are back at our National Response Coordination Center, as well as our Regional Response Coordination Center, representing 22 different Federal Government agencies.</p>, <p>We have, right now, 197 ambulances that have been actively engaged in trying to help with managing your support for the health care system. We also have 12 mobile communication units. Comms have been down, and so we've sent them into the parishes to help increase some of the communications until the cell towers could come back up.</p>, <p>I'd also like to mention that we did just turn on the Transitional Sheltering Assistance Program.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Administrator Criswell.</i> The Governor asked for that, I think yesterday or maybe the day before, which means now individuals that are displaced can stay in a hotel for a short term while we're looking at what their long-term lodging situation is.</p>, <p>And so, if they haven't registered, if the people in your communities have not registered yet, they should register for assistance. Those that have registered, we will reach out to them automatically.</p>, <p>And we've also turned on the Blue Roof program. We saw some of the blue roofs as we flew in today. And so those who have damages to their roofs, they can go to blueroof.us.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Let's make it clear: The Governor is afraid of that guy. That's why he insisted—[<i>inaudible</i>].</p>, <p><i>Administrator Criswell.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] So we'll have that available to help with some of those temporary roofing repairs.</p>, <p>And then the last thing I'll just quickly mention is, we know that responder lodging is a concern. I've heard that from you, Governor, as well as some of your staff. We are moving responder lodging into the areas. We have 200 beds that are already set up here in New Orleans—or, in New Orleans at the airport. We have 300 more en route to Morgan City. And we have 300 en route to Belle Chasse. And then we're also looking at bringing in a cruise ship to help support responders.</p>, <p>And this isn't just for our Federal responders, this will be for your first responders as well. And so, we're actively pursuing additional lodging to help support those that really need to be able to stay close and support your communities.</p>, <p>And this is just the beginning. We're going to be here until your recovery is over.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Not going away.</p>, <p><i>Director Richmond.</i> Mr. President, before I recognize our host—parish host, as we looked at those blue roofs, and I think this is important, especially for the country to know, that as our Federal program gets up and running, we've provided blue roofs, but a lot of those roofs are up because the people of Louisiana decided to get on their roof, put up a tarp, mitigate their damage, and start that recovery process immediately.</p>, <p>So the fact that you were able to get those tarps out to parishes so people could pick them up and start their recovery was important. And looking at the vast number, it was just incredible and gives me a sense of Louisiana pride to just show that when we get knocked down, we get right back up.</p>, <p>And with that, I'll recognize——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Can I make one other point? [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Director Richmond.</i> Okay.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> One of the things that, again, about resilience, where—you're going to get the funding to build back those roofs, but not the same roof—a roof that is more resistant to higher winds, more resistance to hurricanes.</p>, <p>So it's not just building back to what the roof was before, to build it back better. That's kind of what I mean—that's a classic example of what I'm talking about—resilience—of changing the nature of it.</p>, <p><i>Director Richmond.</i> So, Mr. President, with that, I'll recognize the parish president for St. John Parish, Jaclyn Hotard.</p>, <p><i>President Jaclyn Hotard of St. John the Baptist Parish, LA.</i> Thank you, Cedric. Mr. President, Governor, FEMA, and all of our partners, thank you for all of the hard work that was done in preparation for Hurricane Ida. And thank you for the response so far on the ground and for continuing to ramp up those efforts.</p>, <p>Mr. President, from your track record, I know you will be a great partner in our recovery. Thank you for your support and your continued support for the West Shore Lake Pontchartrain levee project. And thank you for calling out the insurance companies for distinguishing between mandatory and voluntary evacuations.</p>, <p>Mr. President, our immediate needs are power, water, communications, and financial assistance for those who can't return home and are forced to stay somewhere else during the recovery. And thank you.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Director Richmond.</i> You know, part of some of the dilemmas when we do meetings like this is who we're going to recognize and who we're going to recognize next, and Senate—now-Congressman Carter represents the second congressional district, which we're in and would be a logical choice, but actually Congressman Graves has more seniority on him. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the press was escorted out of the room, and the briefing continued.</i>]</p>]"
10,8,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the National Economy and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-economy-and-exchange-with-reporters-11,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good morning. I'm sorry I'm a few minutes late. We're getting ready to head down to Louisiana, and I had a few things I had to do.</p>, <p>Look, we—as we head into Labor Day weekend, we have more evidence of the progress of our economy from last year's economic calamity.</p>, <p>Today we learned the economy created 235 new—thousand—new jobs in August. And the unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent, the lowest it has been in 18 months.</p>, <p>But despite the impact of the Delta variant—and I'll talk a little more about that in a minute—what we're seeing is an economic recovery that is durable and strong.</p>, <p>The Biden plan is working. We're getting results. America is on the move again. And today's revision of previous month's job gains, with the revision of the July numbers—this report means that we have been adding an average of 750,000 jobs per month, on average, during the past 3 months.</p>, <p>And in the 3 months before I became President? Well, we were adding 60,000 jobs a month. The total job creation in the first 7 months of my administration is nearly double—double—any prior first-year President.</p>, <p>While I know some wanted to see a larger number today—and so did I—what we've seen this year is a continued growth, month after month, in job creation. It's not just that I've added more jobs than any first-year President—in the first year of any President, it's that we've added jobs in every single one of my first seven job reports. And wages are going up.</p>, <p>Some more jobs—some months there are fewer, some months more, but always adding jobs. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger and consistent progress and not boom or bust.</p>, <p>Our economy grew the first half of this year at the fastest rate in about 40 years. We're the only developed country in the world—I'll say that again—we're the only developed country in the world whose economy is now bigger than it was before the pandemic.</p>, <p>Because of the groundwork we laid with the American Rescue Plan, our vaccination—and our vaccination strategy, we're seeing an economy and a job market that can weather the ups and downs of the Delta variant and anything else that comes our way.</p>, <p>You know, we have a lot more work to do, as I will discuss shortly. But the facts speak for themselves. Think of where this country stood on the day I was sworn in as President, and compare it to where we are today.</p>, <p>The number of people filing new claims for unemployment each week is down 57 percent. Down 57 percent. Child poverty is down nearly 50 percent. We're no longer seeing long lines of people waiting for boxes of food to be put in their trunk after waiting for hours or sometimes up to 2 hours. The unemployment rate is down, from 6.3 percent to 5.2. And I believe it's going to continue to go down.</p>, <p>And it's no wonder that last week's Gallup poll found that 72 percent of Americans think that now is a good time to find a quality job. At this time last year, that number was 30 percent. And that's the mark of an economy where regular people can see a place for themselves in the economy.</p>, <p>You know, the holidays we celebrate this weekend—the holiday, Labor Day, is about honoring the dignity of work, honoring the American worker. And that's what our economic strategy is all about as well.</p>, <p>It's about growing our economy from the bottom up and the middle out, providing some extra breathing room for families—and my dad would just say, ""just a little breathing room""—creating an environment where employers have truly—have to compete—compete for workers by providing higher wages and better benefits. That's what's happening. Wages are up, especially for working class Americans.</p>, <p>Even so, even with the progress we've made, we're not where we need to be in our economic recovery. There are two critical tasks ahead this month to get us closer to our goal and to take the next steps in our recovery.</p>, <p>The first: We need to make more progress in fighting the Delta variant of COVID-19. This is a continuing pandemic of the unvaccinated. Since becoming President, I've ramped up testing, secured enough vaccine for every single American and gotten 175 million Americans fully vaccinated. Still—still—too many have not gotten vaccinated. And it's creating a lot of unease in our economy and around our kitchen tables.</p>, <p>Today's report shows that the steps we've taken, passing the Rescue Plan and vaccinating 175 million people, make our economy capable of growing and adding jobs even in the face of this continuing Delta surge, a strength in our economy very different from the way things were last winter.</p>, <p>There's no question the Delta variant is why today's jobs report isn't stronger. I know people were looking, and I was hoping, for a higher number. But next week, I'll lay out the next steps that are going to—we're going to need to combat the Delta variant, to address some of those fears and concerns.</p>, <p>I want to talk about how we'll further protect our schools, our businesses, our economy, and our families from the threat of Delta. As we continue to fight the Delta variant, the American Rescue Plan we passed continues to support families, businesses, and communities. Even as some of the benefits that were provided are set to expire next week, States have the option to extend those benefits and the Federal resources from the Rescue Plan to do so. Not more Federal taxes, State taxes, but they have the Federal money to be able to do that.</p>, <p>States continue to have access to a wide array of support, like help for schools that are reopening, help for childcare centers to make them available and affordable, and other resources to help our economy get back to normal.</p>, <p>The measures we've taken so far have brought America out of an economic freefall, steadied us, and enabled us to grow our economy even as we combat—continue to combat COVID. We are adding jobs, not losing them. The fight against COVID today is far different from the fight we were waging last winter.</p>, <p>The second thing that has to happen in September is for the Congress—the House and Senate—to finish the job of passing my economic agenda so that we can keep up the historic momentum we've been building these last 7 months. It's about investing in America's future, not about short-term stimulus; that's not what we're talking about.</p>, <p>These are long-term prosperity we're talking about, about lowering the cost of living for families, creating millions of good-paying jobs for hard-working Americans. It's about reducing bottlenecks in our economy, reducing long-term price pressures. It's about helping more people to work by helping ease the burden that parents bear, especially mothers, keeping them out of the job market.</p>, <p>Both the Senate and the House have taken important steps forward to pass my bipartisan infrastructure plan. This bill is going to end years of gridlock. We used to—remember when we had—we always had—you know, the whole notion we had, I guess, was every week was going to be infrastructure week?</p>, <p>Well, both literally and figuratively, it's going to change things on our streets across the country and, figuratively, as it relates to Washington. We're going to create millions of good-paying jobs. We're going to ease inflationary pressure and allow us to win the competition of the 21st century in a global economy where the competition has become more intense.</p>, <p>Look, it's historic investment in roads, in rail, in transit and bridges, in clean energy, in clean water, universal broadband. It's going to modernize our energy grid. You need not go any further than look what's happening across the country now in terms of the energy grid. It's about resilience. Make our roads and highways safer. Make us more resilient to the kinds of devastating impacts from extreme weather we're seeing in so many parts of the country.</p>, <p>And look, this is about good-paying jobs for ordinary people, blue-collar workers. Jobs at prevailing wage, not $15 an hour or $20 or $30. But for the carpenters and pipe fitters, plumbers, electrical workers, and so many other Americans, about 90 percent of the jobs we'll create with this plan won't require a college degree. It will fundamentally transform the lives of millions of people. It's going to transform America and propel us into the future, just as we did when we built the transcontinental railroad or we had—electrified the country, the TVA.</p>, <p>Look, at the same time, the House and Senate have to advance my Build Back Better agenda. That bill contains critical investments in childcare to make it easier for families to be able to go to work and assure their child is being taken care of and home care for seniors. The polling data shows: Among your generation—all of you out here—your greatest concern is caring for your elderly parent, even more than your child.</p>, <p>It's about paid leave—allowing people with a new child or a sick spouse at home to take care of them without risking losing their paycheck—not indefinitely, but for a time period they can actually make a difference.</p>, <p>Universal pre-K and community college—making us significantly better educated and increasing our competitive edge globally, around the world, over time.</p>, <p>And we'll combat climate change by building our clean energy future, creating—the experts point out—millions of jobs and building windmills and solar panels all around the country, and transferring that energy—transmitting it to parts that don't have that capacity.</p>, <p>We're going to bring down the cost of prescription drugs by allowing Medicare to finally be able to negotiate drug prices with producers. Look—and so much more.</p>, <p>Here's the thing you need to know: We're going to deliver these investments without raising taxes 1 cent on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. How are we going to do that? We're going to do it by leveling the playing field; by just having a fair system where we ask the largest corporations and the wealthiest Americans to begin to pay their fair share, not more.</p>, <p>They can still make millions of dollars. The superwealthy are still going to be able to have three homes. It's not going to affect anything. The fact of the matter is, though, it's about time they begin to pay their fair share.</p>, <p>For example—you've heard me say it before, and I'll say it again, but it's the best example to make clear to people a very complicated notion: Fifty-five of the largest corporations in America last year paid zero—zero—in Federal taxes.</p>, <p>Now, I don't care what your position is. It just seems to me it's time they start to pay their fair share like everybody else. Just pay a little bit here, and it comes out to billions of dollars if they pay it.</p>, <p>The irony of ironies is, during the recession and the pandemic—you've heard me say this before; I apologize for repeating it—when the vast majority of Americans were struggling just to hang on, the number of billionaires in America actually grew. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Now, I want to hold here for just a second. If—you know, there have been so many records the stock market has hit under my Presidency. Imagine if the other guy was here: ""We're doing great. It's wonderful. The stock market is surging. It's gone up higher under me than anybody."" But that doesn't mean that it's the best for the economy.</p>, <p>Look, stock market has set 40 record highs just this year. They can afford to pay just a little bit more. But, folks, right now the House and Senate are working on my plan to generate a fairer tax system and close loopholes that big corporations and the superwealthy use to pay less.</p>, <p>To give you one example, there's a group of experts—left, right, and center—who estimate that, right now, we lose more than $100 billion a year in tax revenue owed from the top 1 percent of taxpayers alone, not because of low tax rates, but because wealthy people aren't paying the taxes they owe.</p>, <p>We're going to change that so they pay taxes just like typical hard-working Americans do right now. We're going to use the money we collect from the tax cuts for—to give tax cuts to middle class families, to make it easier to raise kids, to take care of your aging parents, and so much more.</p>, <p>But what's going on in Congress? Not a single Republican supports this plan. They support the bipartisan plan, but not this plan. Not one. And some big corporations are spending millions of dollars in—legitimately—I mean, they're lobbying—to try to escape their obligation to pay the taxes they owe, leaving working families to pay a larger share of the burden.</p>, <p>Somebody has got to pay. And when those who can afford to pay aren't paying anywhere near their fair share, it means you all pay more. You know—and this has worked in the past, with significant lobbying efforts, but I don't think it's going to work with me. For those big corporations that don't want things to change, my message is this: It's time for working families—the folks who built this country—to have their taxes cut.</p>, <p>And those corporate interests doing everything they can to find allies in Congress to keep that from happening, let me be—as the old expression goes—perfectly clear: I'm going to take them on. We're going to pass these measures. We're going to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down.</p>, <p>And when corporations and the wealthiest start to pay their fair share, it's going to put millions of people—according to all the estimates—millions of people to work in jobs that are going to help them punch their ticket to the middle class and stay in the middle class. And everyone will do better, including corporate America.</p>, <p>Look, just think about it: Throughout our history, when the middle class has done well, when it prospers, has there ever been a time the wealthy and corporate America doesn't do well? I can't think of one.</p>, <p>Our country needs these investments. I'm not asking anything other than just some fairness being injected into the system. Like I said, if you'll hold here, the fact is that, you know, the very wealthy will—they're still going to have three homes or four homes, if they want. It's not going to change what schools they can send their kids to. It's not going to change their standard of living. But just pay a fair share.</p>, <p>Corporate America, it's going to continue to do very well. I've seen no evidence to suggest that it's going to cost jobs or cost—I mean, you know, it's just—and now we need Congress to finish the job, to come through for the American people and ensure that the economy continues to gain strength and stability as we move forward.</p>, <p>Now, finally, the third thing we need to do, all of us, is to stick together. We have to put ourselves on track to accomplish extraordinary things: a strong, inclusive, historic economic growth; landmark investments to create even more good jobs and deliver breathing room to millions of families; a giant step forward in the fight against climate change, the crisis made more evident than ever by the death and destruction caused by extreme weather just these past few days.</p>, <p>My agenda, I believe, is one that every American, if they understand it, can get behind. And because of the work we've all put in—not just here in Washington, but in communities across the country—every one of those goals is now within our reach.</p>, <p>Coming together has always been part of the DNA of Americans. And if we can summon that instinct within us to unite as one people, one Nation, there is nothing beyond our capacity.</p>, <p>So let's keep going. Let's stick together. And let's remember who we are. You've heard me say it time and again: We're the United States of America. And the rest of the world is looking to us, just because we're the most prosperous nation in the world right now. We're growing. And there's a fairness to what we're doing. A fairness.</p>, <p>We'll still have millionaires. We'll still have billionaires. We'll still have corporations that do incredibly well and CEOs that make a lot of money. But everybody has to start paying their fair share.</p>, <p>Thank you very much.</p>, <p><i>Reproductive Freedom of Choice/Abortion Restriction Legislation in Texas </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, on abortion rights in Texas, sir.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Pardon me?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>One question on abortion rights in Texas, sir. What would be your message to women in Texas? And what can your administration do to protect abortion rights on the Federal level?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm late for going down. I'm going to talk about these things from Louisiana. But I have been—continue to be a strong supporter of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. Number one.</p>, <p>And the most pernicious thing about the Texas law: It sort of creates a vigilante system where people get rewards to go out to—anyway. And it just seems—I know this sounds ridiculous—almost un-American, what we're talking about—not to debate about—and I understand—I respect people who think that—who don't support <i>Roe v. Wade</i>; I respect their views. I respect them—they—those who believe life begins at the moment of conception and all. I respect that. Don't agree, but I respect that. I'm not going to impose that on people.</p>, <p>But what I was told—and I must tell you, I am not certain—I was told that there are possibilities within the existing law to have the Justice Department look and see whether there are things that can be done that can limit the independent action of individuals in enforcing a Federal system—a State law. I don't know enough to give you an answer yet. I've asked that to be checked.</p>, <p>Thank you all very much.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, is there any update on the status of getting Americans out of Afghanistan?</p>]"
10,9,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks During a Videoconference on the Jewish High Holidays,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-during-videoconference-the-jewish-high-holidays,"[<p>Well, thank you very much. I should start off with a bit of an apology. When I was Vice President, for 8 years I had a celebration at my home—my temporary home of the Vice President's Residence—and I had planned on doing that here at the White House, but for COVID. So, next year, I hope. Next year. Not only next year in Jerusalem—[<i>laughter</i>]—but next year at the White House, God willing.</p>, <p>And let me say, Rabbi: Thank you for the introduction. And I also want you to thank the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Rabbinical Assembly, the Rabbinical Council, and the—Council of America—and the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association for cosponsoring this call. Rabbi, I just want to thank all of you—each one of you—for spearheading this effort.</p>, <p>Look, it's always great to see my friend, Michael Beals. I spent an awful lot of time—they began to worry—I spent more time at Beth Shalom, but I always went to mass first. I always went to mass first. You think I'm kidding; I'm not. But I want to thank you for the beautiful opening prayer and for your friendship.</p>, <p>As many of you know, as I said—when Jill and I used to host everyone at our temporary residence—our public housing we had at the Naval Observatory for the High Holidays, of course—we served apples and honey and—as a sign of America's capacity to change and progress. I'm proud the Naval Academy—the Naval Observatory, once head of the Naval—the Chief of Naval Operations—is now occupied by Vice President Kamala Harris and the Second Gentleman, Doug Emhoff.</p>, <p>Look, while the season of awe is a sacred time for Jews here in America and around the world, the message of the holidays, I've always believed, is universal. Renewal. Renewal. When I was running for President, I placed the idea of renewal at the center of my campaign. I said my mission was to restore America's soul. I got criticized for that, but I meant it in a literal sense. We seemed to have lost our way. We lost the—a sense of comradery. We treated each other so harshly, the way we spoke of one another and the way in which we dealt with politics.</p>, <p>And I thought it was essential because, you know, America is an idea; it's an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, et cetera. No other country has been based on that notion. And when we stop respecting one another, that all begins to change.</p>, <p>You know, Rosh Hashanah and the Days of Awe present us with a chance to restore our souls: our own souls, our individual souls. And the High Holy Days also allow us to take collective responsibility for renewal. I happen to be a practicing Catholic, and one of the things I like about my Pope today is that he's all about renewal and forgiveness. That's what he's about. And I look forward to—I hope I'm going to get to see him in the not-too-distant future.</p>, <p>But you know, I think that—I think the world is starting to realize what's been missing of late. Not only do we have to look inward, we also need to look at each other and talk to each other, rebuild communities through empathy and acts of kindness and decency.</p>, <p>You know, we need to look outward to bridge the gap between the world we see and the future we seek. And that gap, that chasm seems to be widening rather than narrowing. And the work of our renewal is front of mind as we take pride in the progress so far and acknowledge the immense challenges that remain.</p>, <p>You know, when I took office—took the oath—we were on—in the depths of a once-in-a-century pandemic. And today, though we still face a long road ahead, thanks to the miracles of science and medicine and the dedication of so many, we've vaccinated tens of millions of Americans, and hundreds of thousands of lives have been saved. We're going to emerge from this pandemic, but we just have to—we have to focus more.</p>, <p>When my Presidency began, we saw millions out of work and long lines at food banks. I mean, I never thought I'd see a time when people were lined up for a better part of an hour or more in nice-looking automobiles, just waiting for a box of food to be stuck in their trunk.</p>, <p>And now we've created millions of jobs. We're lifting millions of children and families out of poverty, and building our economy back better. But you know, we'll continue to confront other societal challenges as well, like the scourge of anti-Semitism. It remains all too present today.</p>, <p>You know, I had a chance to meet with the new Prime Minister of Israel. He's a gentle man. He's—we talked about how his—he has much more conservative views on matters in the Middle East than I do, but he knows, as he pointed out—he said, ""You've met every single Prime Minister, and you've known them since Golda Meir.""</p>, <p>And I told him something Golda Meir said to me after a long—it was after the Six-Day War. And I was in her office, and she had an assistant sitting next to me in the front of the desk, a guy named Rabin. [<i>Laughter</i>] And she was leaning back, and she had that—on the back of her wall she had these maps that you can pull up and down, you know? And she kept pulling the maps down and showing me how many people have died and what happened and so on and so forth.</p>, <p>And I would—by the time we got finished, she said all of a sudden, out of the blue—she said, ""Would you like a photograph?"" And I looked at her, and I said, ""Well, sure, Madam Prime Minister."" And she knew I had been a bit of a student of Israel and I distinctly—I was raised by a righteous Christian, a father who—who made sure that we had dinner where we incidentally ate, and we talked. And my father was the one who was—would rail against the fact that—what—we didn't bomb railroad tracks in World War II and all—I know Michael knows this.</p>, <p>And what I've done since I became an elected official: On my 16th birthday of each of my children, I put them on a plane and take them to Europe. And the first stop I've taken them to was to go into one of the concentration camps, because I wanted them to see how this can happen again. I wanted them to see, as that—as, you know, Auschwitz and other places. We didn't—that's not where I took the first one.</p>, <p>And the sign over the gate, you know, ""Your work will set you free,"" et cetera. And visit where the chambers were—the gas chambers. And right next to it and along the fence line were these beautiful homes that had tile roofs. And everybody pretended they didn't know what was going on. You know, the—and so my dad's notion was always that, you know, you've just—we've just got to keep remembering. And I've taken every one of my children and now my grandchildren. I got two grandchildren left to take.</p>, <p>And the point I'm trying to make here is that I used to think coming out of the civil rights movement and being involved in the Jewish community as a kid and the civil rights movement—in Delaware—I used to think that hate could be defeated, it could be wiped out. But I learned a long time ago, it can't. It only hides. It hides. It hides under the rocks. And given any oxygen at all, it comes out. It's a minority view, but it comes out and it comes out raging.</p>, <p>And it's been given too much oxygen in the last 4, 5, 7, 10 years, and it has seen itself, whether it was—I remember spending time at the—you know, going to the—you know, the Tree of Life synagogue, speaking with them—just—it just is amazing these things are happening, happening in America.</p>, <p>And I guess the point I want to make is that it just shows that if we walk away from ""Never Again,"" it's going to happen again. It can't happen again. And so I guess the point I'm making is that the attack in Pittsburgh, those attacks—all anti-Semitic attacks—aren't just a strike against the Jewish community; they're a strike against the soul of our Nation and the values which we say we stand for. No matter its source or stated rationale, we have to and will condemn this prejudice at every turn, alongside other forms of hate.</p>, <p>But you know, it's time that we deep—we be deeply mindful of a world beyond our borders, even as we did what was necessary and right to end 20 years of war in Afghanistan. And we mourn all those who we lost, including 13 brave servicemembers who were killed alongside so many other innocents in an act of terror and malice.</p>, <p>And in spite of welcoming the stranger, we now embark on the next phase of this mission, which is the cause that the Jewish community so often led. Whether it was Soviet Jews coming to America or Ethiopian Jews headed to Israel, we have to integrate these newcomers and help them begin to renew and rebuild their own lives.</p>, <p>And this New Year, we're going to have to remain steadfast in our pursuit of peace. We never waver in our support for the future security of the State of Israel. Because I told you, when I met Golda Meir, after she was going through that, flipping the maps up and down, she said, ""Would you like a photograph?""</p>, <p>The part I didn't tell you: We walked out, and we stood in that hallway many of you have been. And we stood there, and there were camera people and—while I was having our photographs taken. And she—without looking at me, she said, ""Senator, you look so somber. Don't worry."" And I—without looking at her, I said, ""I am very worried, based on what you just told me."" She said: ""No, no. We Jews have a secret weapon in our fight with the Arabs."" And I turned and looked at her.</p>, <p>It's a true story, and I've written about it. And she said, ""We have no place else to go."" ""We have no place else to go."" Well, the truth of the matter is that's probably true, but it's so sad. And we have to make—we have to continue to fight like hell to make sure there's—any place can be gone.</p>, <p>We're going to maintain those deep bonds that started at the birth of the Jewish state, a bond I'm honored—I had the honor of renewing with Prime Minister Bennett at the White House last week.</p>, <p>The challenges before us, I think, are monumental. But if Jewish history and tradition teaches us anything, it's the resilient belief in the promise of tomorrow. Even after the worst destruction and pain, the Jewish people have recovered, rebuilt, emerged stronger than before, and we—so must we.</p>, <p>And may God inscribe each of us in the Book of Life. And I hope you all have a happy and healthy and sweet New Year. <i>Shanah Tovah</i>.</p>, <p>But you know, here's—I want to say one more thing. I just want you to know that—and there is hope for some religious collaboration down the road here. As Rabbi Beals will tell you, my daughter married a Jewish young man. And I—you know, dream of every—every Catholic father that she marry a Jewish doctor.</p>, <p>But all kidding aside, he did—he's a great surgeon. And we wanted to have a coconfessional wedding, and everybody said, ""What do you mean by that?"" The rabbi will tell you, I contacted a friend of mine in Delaware, who's passed away—she was just an incredible woman—to find me a rabbi who'd come and preside in a Catholic Church, the oldest Catholic Church in the State, that I belonged to it, built in 1842.</p>, <p>And we had a <i>chuppah</i> on the altar, and we had a—it was co-officiated. Now, some of you aren't going to like this, but it was co-officiated by a Catholic priest as well as a Jewish rabbi. And I had only asked one thing. They asked me—and I arranged it—and I only asked one thing. There's a psalm based—there's a hymn—my favorite hymn in the Catholic Church based on a psalm, and it's a psalm that talks about life. And so I asked if that psalm, that hymn in the Catholic Church.</p>, <p>And it says, ""May He lift you up on Eagle's wings and bear you on the breath of dawn, and let the light shine upon you,"" et cetera, and—""and hold you in the palm of his hand."" And they played—and I'm—my mind is going blank now. What's the song that is played where everybody is on the chair? Everybody, you know—what—I can't remember it. Anyway, and that's the song that was played. So, you know, I don't know what the hell is going on here. I just had one little favor, you know, just that they play ""On Eagle's Wings.""</p>, <p>But look, I'm taking too much of your time, but I really, honest to God, believe that we have a possibility—a possibility—to make things so much better, and we just have to believe it.</p>, <p>You know, I always am criticized by colleagues in the Senate because I'm always quoting Irish poets. They think I do it because I'm Irish. I don't do it for that reason, Rabbi—person; I do it because they're the best poets in the world. That's why I do it.</p>, <p>But there's a that—written by a famous Irish poet who said that—he talked about—about the future. And he said, ""The world has changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty has been born."" But it can be made beautiful. There's so much we can do. People are looking over the edge, and they're all of a sudden realizing we got to change. We've got to change.</p>, <p>And I'm not being solicitous, but I think the Jewish community is sort of the backbone of staying with what's right. And so I'm looking forward to continue to work with you. And again, happy holidays.</p>]"
11,0,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on Hurricane Ida Recovery Efforts,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-hurricane-ida-recovery-efforts,"[<p>Good morning. Sorry to keep you waiting; I was getting further updates.</p>, <p>I just spoke with Governor Hochul of New York and Governor Murphy of New Jersey, and I plan to speak with Governor Wolf of Pennsylvania after last night's devastating storm and floods from Hurricane Ida, the fifth largest hurricane in our history.</p>, <p>Record rain fell on these States. New York recorded more rain yesterday—the first day of September—than it usually sees the entire month of September. We saw more than 3 inches of rain per hour fall in Central Park.</p>, <p>The United States National Weather Service issued a flood emergency in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Staten Island, and parts of Long Island last night. This is the first time that such a warning has ever been issued for the city. People were trapped in the subways, but the heroic men and women of the New York Fire Department rescued all of them. But they were trapped.</p>, <p>We're seeing the same story of devastation and heroism across New Jersey and Pennsylvania as well. For now, 11 people in New York and New Jersey died because of the storm. And I want to express my heartfelt thanks to all the first responders and everyone who's been working through the night and well into this morning to save lives and get power back.</p>, <p>There's lot of damage, and I made clear to the Governors that my team at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, is on the ground and ready to provide all the assistance that's needed.</p>, <p>In fact, our FEMA Director—Administrator——</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President coughed.</i>]</p>, <p>Excuse me—Deanne Criswell will—was the chief Federal response officer after Superstorm Sandy in 2012. She knows what to do.</p>, <p><i>Caldor Fire in California </i></p>, <p>And last night, at the request of California Governor Newsom, I approved an emergency declaration for California for the Caldor Fire, which is burning aggressively toward Lake Tahoe Basin and into Nevada. It's also one of few fires that has ever burned from one side of Sierra-Nevada mountain range to the other.</p>, <p>So far, it's burned more than 200,000 acres. Tens of thousands of people have been—had to evacuate their homes. The fire is threatening close to 35,000 structures. And more than 4,400 firefighters from the State and my Federal team are working to contain and suppress this raging wildfire. The Department of Defense has trained and is deploying additional firefighters to support our ongoing firefighting efforts in California.</p>, <p>This disaster declaration will help with evacuation, including sheltering and feeding for those who have been displaced.</p>, <p>I want you to know: I've seen these firefighters up close. Their courage is astounding, and they're some of the bravest people I've ever known, and I've known a lot of them. My heart goes out to them. My thanks is—an abundant thanks for what they do.</p>, <p><i>Hurricane Ida Recovery Efforts </i></p>, <p>Now I want to provide an update on our efforts to help millions of Americans down South recover and rebuild from Hurricane Ida. We've been monitoring this hurricane closely and the devastation it's caused. To date, six deaths. About a million homes are without power in Louisiana and Mississippi.</p>, <p>While the catastrophic flooding wasn't as severe as it was during Hurricane Katrina 16 years ago, Ida was so powerful that it caused the Mississippi River literally to change direction—the flow—change the flow temporarily.</p>, <p>The good news is that, as a result of a significant multibillion-dollar Federal investment in the levee system around metro New Orleans, it held. It was strong. It worked. But too many people and too many areas are still unprotected and saw a storm surge and flooding that was devastating.</p>, <p>We've seen reports of winds up to 170 miles per hour—it's not been confirmed yet by FEMA, but 170 miles an hour—causing unimaginable damage, with debris and downed powerlines making roads impassable and slowing response efforts to save folks and property. You know, the people continue to shelter in place.</p>, <p>Tomorrow I'll be traveling to Louisiana to meet with Governor John Bel Edwards, as well as the parish presidents and mayors and the local officials representing the affected areas. Governor Edwards encouraged me to come and assured me that my visit will not disrupt recovery efforts on the ground. That's what I wanted to be sure of.</p>, <p>My message to everyone affected is, we're all in this together. The Nation is here to help. That's the message I've been making clear to the mayors, Governors, energy and utility leaders in the region, who my administration has been working closely with over the past few days.</p>, <p>Working with Governors in the area, even before Ida made landfall, I issued emergency declarations for Louisiana and Mississippi to help us respond quickly. FEMA prepositioned more than 4.3 million meals and more than 3 million liters of water and other critical resources in the region before it hit.</p>, <p>We deplored more—we deployed more than 250 generators, and we're working to getting more into the area, especially to hospitals in desperate need of them. The Department of Health and Human Services deployed 250—a 250-bed Federal medical shelter in New Orleans and five medical assistance teams available throughout the State.</p>, <p>Since the hurricane hit, more than 6,000 members of the National Guard have been activated in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas, and other States to support search-and-rescue and recovery efforts. For those who have lost their homes, States have been working with the Red—American Red Cross to open almost 50 shelters across the Gulf Coast.</p>, <p>We know that there is much to be done in this response on our part. We need to get power restored. We need to get more food, fuel, and water deployed. I get hourly updates on the progress from FEMA, well into the night, and we'll be working around the clock until the critical needs of the region are fully met. And we will meet them.</p>, <p>Even as we tackle the core elements of the disaster response, we're also deploying new tools to help speed this recovery, things that have not been used very much in prior hurricane responses.</p>, <p>Working with private companies that own and operate the life-line infrastructure, like electricity and communications, we've used the latest technology to accelerate restoration of power and cell phone service. It's beginning to get back up, but there's a long way to go.</p>, <p>For example, to minimize the amount of time it will take to get the power back to everyone, I've directed the Federal Aviation Commission [Administration],For example, to minimize the amount of time it will take to get the power back to everyone, I've directed the Federal Aviation Commission [Administration],For example, to minimize the amount of time it will take to get the power back to everyone, I've directed the Federal Aviation Commission [Administration],</p>, <p>Likewise, I've asked the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Energy to immediately make available any satellite imagery they can help provide in assessing the extent of the damage.</p>, <p>Drones and satellites can make the work faster by getting to the places that are most desperately in need. They can identify where the lines are down, map the damage, help get the transmission lines back up and running in all the parishes.</p>, <p>But people—hard-working people—do the complicated and dangerous work. There are more than 25,000 linemen and clearance crews from 32 States and the District of Columbia racing to restore power. In Alabama, two have died on the job. This is complicated and really dangerous work. But we're moving as fast as humanly possible to get it done.</p>, <p>It's important to know that the region hit by Ida is a key center of our Nation's oil production and refining infrastructure. That's why we're not waiting to assess the full impact that the storm is going to have on oil production and refineries. We're moving already, quickly, to increase the availability of gas and easing the pressure on gas prices around the country. I've directed the Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, to use all of the tools at her disposal, including using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to keep gas flowing to the pumps.</p>, <p>In order to get critical supplies to the region to beat the pandemic, I directed the Department of Transportation to renew an energy [emergency]* declaration to provide flexibility on how many hours a truck driver can drive. Most people don't know there's a limitation on the number of hours you can be on the road.</p>, <p>The Transportation Department is broadening that emergency declaration to include transportation of gasoline and other types of fuel as well, in addition to medical supplies and food.</p>, <p>In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has approved emergency waivers for Louisiana and Mississippi that will expand the supply of gasoline that can be sold in those States and increase availability at such a critical time. These actions should help reduce the risk of gas shortages and price increases as a result of the hurricane.</p>, <p>We also know a lot of people lost cell phone service because their particular carrier's tower went down or got damaged. A few days ago, I asked the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, and my White House team to work with the cell phone companies to allow customers to use roaming services. So that means that folks in the area should be able to get a signal no matter what carrier they're with. If their one carrier is down, they can roam and use another carrier they're not part of—they're not signed up with.</p>, <p>Just think of the sons and the daughters and the moms and dads of loved ones trying to reach each other and the feeling of fear, of ""maybe something happened,"" and it's just because they can't—the cell phone is not working. Think of the millions of people reaching out for help. This is important, and it's critical.</p>, <p>Now, a lot of private companies and public entities are doing their part. Today I'm calling on insurance companies not to evade their responsibility to keep the priorities they made to their customers and the promises they made and help some folks who are hurting.</p>, <p>Here's the deal: FEMA is providing critical need assistance, for example, to help with the hotel bill you racked up because you couldn't stay in your home during the hurricane. The Department of Housing and Urban Affairs [Development],* HUD, is also offering assistance to families in impacted areas.</p>, <p>But right now we're hearing reports that some insurance companies may deny coverage for additional living assistance expenses unless the homeowner was under a mandatory evacuation order. So people paid their insurance premiums, and they're supposed to get payments from their insurance companies for relocation costs. But insurance companies, in the face of the strongest storm since 1850, say, ""No, no, we're not going to pay you what we owe you.""</p>, <p>Because the fact is, parishes in Louisiana, like New Orleans and St. John's, issued a voluntary evacuation order at first and may not have even have had enough time to make a mandatory one as the storm moved in so fast.</p>, <p>Other parishes, a voluntary evacuation order suggested that residents could try to protect themselves by sheltering in place against the ferocious winds. But we can all understand why folks felt safest leaving their homes and going elsewhere, out of the path of the devastating storm.</p>, <p>No one—no one—fled this killer storm because they were looking for a vacation or a road trip. You're able to stay in a hotel. They left their homes because they felt it was flee or risk death. There's nothing voluntary about that.</p>, <p>So I'm calling on private insurance companies right now, at this critical moment: Don't hide behind the fine print and technicality. Do your job. Keep your commitments to your communities that you insure. Do the right thing and pay your policy holders what you owe them to cover the cost of temporary housing in the midst of a natural disaster. Help those in need.</p>, <p>That's what all of us need to do. That's what we're trying to do. FEMA has pushed out $77 million to the people of Louisiana so far—individuals.</p>, <p>My message to the people of the Gulf Coast, who I'm going to visit tomorrow: We are here for you. And we're making sure the response and recovery is equitable so that those hit hardest get the resources they need and are not left behind.</p>, <p>Whether you're a homeowner, a renter, a parent, a small-business owner—no matter who you are—if you live in the affected area, please visit disasterassistance.gov. Go online, and visit disasterassistance.gov to find help now. That's disasterassistance.gov. Or call 1-800-621-FEMA—F-E-M-A; 1-800-621-FEMA—F-E-M-A. That's 1-800-621-3362. There's help you can qualify for right away.</p>, <p>I've talked—I've tasked my Senior Adviser, Cedric Richmond, New Orleans neighbor and former Congressman from Louisiana's Second District for 10 years, to lead this relief effort. He knows the area. He knows the people. He knows how to get things done. And he knows they get things done when local, State, and Federal level are all working together alongside the private sector. The people of Louisiana and Mississippi are resilient and resourceful. We're going to stand with you for as long as it takes to recover and allow you to rebuild.</p>, <p>And to the country: The past few days of Hurricane Ida and the wildfires in the West and the unprecedented flash floods in New York and New Jersey is yet another reminder that these extreme storms and the climate crisis are here. We need to do—be much better prepared. We need to act.</p>, <p>When Congress returns this month, I'm going to press for their action on my Build Back Better plan that's going to make historic investments in electrical infrastructure, modernizing our roads, bridges, our water systems, sewer and drainage systems, electric grids and transmission lines, and make them more resilient to these superstorms and wildfires and floods that are going to happen with increasing frequency and ferocity.</p>, <p>We're reminded that this isn't about politics. Hurricane Ida didn't care if you were a Democrat or a Republican, rural or urban. This destruction is everywhere. And it's a matter of life and death, and we're all in this together.</p>, <p>This is one of the great challenges of our time, but I'm confident we'll meet it. We're the United States of America. And there is simply nothing—you've heard me say it before—nothing beyond our capacity when we work together.</p>, <p>So, for all those who are still in harm's way, of all those struggling to deal with the aftermath of these storms and fires, I say: God bless you. Keep the faith. Everyone working day and night to look out for their fellow Americans is what this is about. And we're going to get this done.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>]"
11,1,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-president-volodymyr-zelenskiy-ukraine,"[<p><i>President Biden.</i> It's an honor and a pleasure to welcome President Zelenskiy to the White House, to the Oval Office. As we celebrate 30 years of Ukrainian independence, the partnership between our nations grows stronger, and it's going to even become stronger than it has been.</p>, <p>Ukraine and the United States have a similar value system and a strong commitment to the fulfillment of a promise that we hope all will come forward, and that is a Europe whole, free, and at peace. And the United States remains firmly committed to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russian aggression and—and—our support for Ukraine's Euro-Atlantic aspirations.</p>, <p>Today we're going to discuss how the U.S. can continue to support Ukraine as it advances its democratic reforms, agenda, and movement toward being completely integrated in Europe.</p>, <p>We're revitalizing the Strategic Partnership Commission between our nations. And we're also creating a new strategic defense framework and a new $60 million security assistance package, as well as a new energy and climate dialogue to help Ukraine diversify its energy supplies while supporting our climate goals relating to global warming.</p>, <p>And of course, we'll talk about our ongoing fight against COVID-19. And the United States has donated 2.2 million vaccines to—through—to Ukraine through COVAX. And we're going to continue to work to provide more as well.</p>, <p>We have much to talk about. And I still remember the opportunity that I had to speak to the Rada years ago, and I look forward to being able to come back some day to see you.</p>, <p>Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>President Zelenskiy.</i> Thank you very much, Mr. President.</p>, <p>First of all, I would like to greet you, ladies and gentlemen, as representatives of the journalist community. And I would like to thank President Biden for his invitation. In the difficult times for the world and for the United States, for Ukraine, still you found time for us, and we are very grateful for this indeed. And of course, the United States, our strategic partner and staunch supporter of our sovereignty and our territorial integrity.</p>, <p>And I would like to use this occasion to thank President Biden personally for following our conversation on the phone and dispatching the more than 2 million vaccines to save Ukrainian lives.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, President Zelenskiy spoke briefly in English as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>More than 2 million.</p>, <p><i>Interpreter.</i> Yes.</p>, <p>[<i>President Zelenskiy continued in Ukrainian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.</i>]</p>, <p><i>President Zelenskiy.</i> And thank you for the $60 million program for defense development in Ukraine until the end of this year. We appreciate this contribution.</p>, <p>And, Mr. President, accept my sincere condolences because of the tragic death of the heroes who were trying to save human lives in Afghanistan and sacrificed their own.</p>, <p>We are very compassionate, and we have the fellow feeling for such losses—such tragic loss—because for 8 years in a row, as you know, we've had this war in the Ukrainian Donbas, and we have lost 15,000 of our best people.</p>, <p>Well, I have a very big agenda for our relations—maybe not for this meeting, which is too short—to answer all the questions, but they are all of big importance for our both countries, I believe. But, at least, we have to focus very much now on the security issue, which is the most important on this agenda. And security in Donbas—the Ukrainian Donbas, in the Ukrainian Crimea—temporarily, as we believe, occupied by the Russian Federation; security in the Black Sea; and security in the Azov Sea region.</p>, <p>And of course, the security issue—energy security at this time, because we are very much concerned, as you are, with the commissioning of—possible commission on the Nord Stream 2.</p>, <p>And I would like to discuss with President Biden here his vision, his government's vision of Ukraine's chances to join NATO and the timeframe for this accession, if it is possible; and the role the United States can play being involved in a peaceful settlement in Donbas that we would like to reach.</p>, <p>And last, but not least, the economic bloc. Because we came to Ukraine—we came to office to transform Ukraine, so we called our program a ""transformation program,"" and we would like to discuss the role that the United States would like to play in this transformation and economic revival of our country.</p>, <p>And finally, a very sensitive issue of this morning, Mr. President: We handed over to your representatives a list of prisoners, prisoners held in the temporarily occupied Donbas; in the temporarily occupied Crimea; in the Russian Federation—their territory, in Moscow. There are 450 people, maybe more, which are held there, and we would like to have your assistance in freeing them and bringing them back to their country.</p>, <p>Thank you very much.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Thank you. We have much to talk about. Thank you, everybody.</p>]"
11,2,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the End of United States Military Operations in Afghanistan,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-end-united-states-military-operations-afghanistan,"[<p>Last night, in Kabul, the United States ended 20 years of war in Afghanistan, the longest war in American history.</p>, <p>We completed one of the biggest airlifts in history, with more than 120,000 people evacuated to safety. That number is more than double what most experts thought were possible. No nation—no nation—has ever done anything like it in all of history. Only the United States had the capacity and the will and the ability to do it, and we did it today.</p>, <p>The extraordinary success of this mission was due to the incredible skill, bravery, and selfless courage of the United States military and our diplomats and intelligence professionals. For weeks, they risked their lives to get American citizens, Afghans who helped us, citizens of our Allies and partners, and others onboard planes and out of the country. And they did it facing a crush of enormous crowds seeking to leave the country. And they did it knowing ISIS-K terrorists—sworn enemies of the Taliban—were lurking in the midst of those crowds.</p>, <p>And still, the men and women of the United States military, our diplomatic corps, and intelligence professionals did their job and did it well, risking their lives not for professional gains, but to serve others; not in a mission of war, but in a mission of mercy. Twenty servicemembers were wounded in the service of this mission. Thirteen heroes gave their lives.</p>, <p>I was just at Dover Air Force Base for the dignified transfer. We owe them and their families a debt of gratitude we can never repay, but we should never, ever, ever forget.</p>, <p>In April, I made the decision to end this war. As part of that decision, we set the date of August 31 for American troops to withdraw. The assumption was that more than 300,000 Afghan National Security Forces that we had trained over the past two decades and equipped would be a strong adversary in their civil wars with the Taliban.</p>, <p>That assumption—that the Afghan Government would be able to hold on for a period of time beyond military drawdown—turned out not to be accurate. But I still instructed our national security team to prepare for every eventuality, even that one. And that's what we did.</p>, <p>So we were ready when the Afghan Security Forces—after two decades of fighting for their country and losing thousands of their own—did not hold on as long as anyone expected. We were ready when they and the people of Afghanistan watched their own Government collapse and their President flee amid the corruption and malfeasance, handing over the country to their enemy, the Taliban, and significantly increasing the risk to U.S. personnel and our allies.</p>, <p>As a result, to safely extract American citizens before August 31—as well as Embassy personnel, allies and partners, and those Afghans who had worked with us and fought alongside of us for 20 years—I had authorized 6,000 troops, American troops, to Kabul to help secure the airport. As General McKenzie said, this is the way the mission was designed. It was designed to operate under severe stress and attack. And that's what it did.</p>, <p>Since March, we reached out 19 times to Americans in Afghanistan, with multiple warnings and offers to help them leave Afghanistan, all the way back as far as March. After we started the evacuation 17 days ago, we did initial outreach and analysis and identified around 5,000 Americans who had decided earlier to stay in Afghanistan, but now wanted to leave.</p>, <p>Our Operation Allied Rescue [Allies Refuge]* ended up getting more than 5,500 Americans out. We got out thousands of citizens and diplomats from those countries that went into Afghanistan with us to get bin Laden. We got out locally employed staff of the United States Embassy and their families, totaling roughly 2,500 people. We got thousands of Afghan translators and interpreters and others who supported the United States out as well.</p>, <p>Now we believe that about 100 to 200 Americans remain in Afghanistan with some intention to leave. Most of those who remain are dual citizens, long-time residents who had earlier decided to stay because of their family roots in Afghanistan. The bottom line: Ninety [Ninety-eight]* percent of Americans in Afghanistan who wanted to leave were able to leave.</p>, <p>And for those remaining Americans, there is no deadline. We remain committed to get them out if they want to come out. Secretary of State Blinken is leading the continued diplomatic efforts to ensure a safe passage for any American, Afghan partner, or foreign national who wants to leave Afghanistan.</p>, <p>In fact, just yesterday the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution that sent a clear message about what the international community expects the Taliban to deliver on moving forward, notably freedom of travel, freedom to leave. Together, we are joined by over 100 countries that are determined to make sure the Taliban upholds those commitments.</p>, <p>It will include ongoing efforts in Afghanistan to reopen the airport, as well as overland routes, allowing for continued departure to those who want to leave and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan. The Taliban has made public commitments, broadcast on television and radio across Afghanistan, on safe passage for anyone wanting to leave, including those who worked alongside Americans. We don't take them by their word alone, but by their actions, and we have leverage to make sure those commitments are met.</p>, <p>And let me be clear: Leaving August the 31st is not due to an arbitrary deadline, it was designed to save American lives.</p>, <p>My predecessor, the former President, signed an agreement with the Taliban to remove U.S. troops by May the 1st, just months after I was inaugurated. It included no requirement that the Taliban work out a cooperative governing arrangement with the Afghan Government, but it did authorize the release of 5,000 prisoners last year, including some of the Taliban's top war commanders, among those who just took control of Afghanistan.</p>, <p>And by the time I came to office, the Taliban was in its strongest military position since 2001, controlling or contesting nearly half of the country. The previous administration's agreement said that if we stuck to the May 1 deadline that they had signed on to leave by, the Taliban wouldn't attack any American forces, but if we stayed, all bets were off.</p>, <p>So we were left with a simple decision: Either follow through on the commitment made by the last administration and leave Afghanistan or say we weren't leaving and commit another tens of thousands more troops going back to war. That was the choice—the real choice—between leaving or escalating.</p>, <p>I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit. The decision to end the military airlift operations at Kabul airport was based on the unanimous recommendation of my civilian and military advisers: the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and all the service chiefs, and the commanders in the field.</p>, <p>Their recommendation was that the safest way to secure the passage of the remaining Americans and others out of the country was not to continue with 6,000 troops on the ground in harm's way in Kabul, but rather to get them out through nonmilitary means.</p>, <p>In the 17 days that we operated in Kabul after the Taliban seized power, we engaged in an around-the-clock effort to provide every American the opportunity to leave. Our State Department was working 24/7 contacting and talking and, in some cases, walking Americans into the airport. Again, more than 5,500 Americans were airlifted out. And for those who remain, we will make arrangements to get them out if they so choose.</p>, <p>As for the Afghans, we and our partners have airlifted 100,000 of them. No country in history has done more to airlift out the residents of another country than we have done. We will continue to work to help more people leave the country who are at risk. And we're far from done.</p>, <p>For now, I urge all Americans to join me in grateful prayer for our troops and diplomats and intelligence officers who carried out this mission of mercy in Kabul and at tremendous risk with such unparalleled results: an airlift that evacuated tens of thousands.</p>, <p>To a network of volunteers and veterans who helped identify those needing evacuation, guide them to the airport, and provided them for their support along the way, we're going to continue to need their help. We need your help. And I'm looking forward to meeting with you. And to everyone who is now offering or who will offer to welcome Afghan allies to their homes around the world, including in America: We thank you.</p>, <p>I take responsibility for the decision. Now, some say we should have started massed evacuations sooner and ""Couldn't this have be done—have been done in a more orderly manner?"" I respectfully disagree.</p>, <p>Imagine if we had begun evacuations in June or July, bringing in thousands of American troops and evacuating more than 120,000 people in the middle of a civil war. There still would have been a rush to the airport, a breakdown in confidence and control of the Government, and it still would have been a very difficult and dangerous mission. The bottom line is: There is no evacuation from the end of a war that you can run without the kinds of complexities, challenges, and threats we faced. None.</p>, <p>There are those who would say we should have stayed indefinitely, for years on end. They ask: ""Why don't we just keep doing what we were doing? Why did we have to change anything?"" The fact is: Everything had changed. My predecessor had made a deal with the Taliban. When I came into office, we faced a deadline, May 1. The Taliban onslaught was coming.</p>, <p>We faced one of two choices: Follow the agreement of the previous administration and extend it to have—or extend to more time for people to get out; or send in thousands of more troops and escalate the war.</p>, <p>To those asking for a third decade of war in Afghanistan, I ask: What is the vital national interest? In my view, we only have one: to make sure Afghanistan can never be used again to launch an attack on our homeland.</p>, <p>Remember why we went to Afghanistan in the first place? Because we were attacked by Usama bin Laden and Al Qaida on September 11, 2001, and they were based in Afghanistan. We delivered justice to bin Laden on May 2, 2011, over a decade ago. Al Qaida was decimated.</p>, <p>I respectfully suggest you ask yourself this question: If we had been attacked on September 11, 2001, from Yemen instead of Afghanistan, would we have ever gone to war in Afghanistan, even though the Taliban controlled Afghanistan in the year 2001? I believe the honest answer is ""no."" That's because we had no vital interest in Afghanistan other than to prevent an attack on America's homeland and their friends—our friends. And that's true today.</p>, <p>We succeeded in what we set out to do in Afghanistan over a decade ago. Then we stayed for another decade. It was time to end this war.</p>, <p>This is a new world. The terror threat has metastasized across the world, well beyond Afghanistan. We face threats from al-Shabaab in Somalia; Al Qaida affiliates in Syria and the Arabian Peninsula; and ISIS attempting to create a caliphate in Syria and Iraq, and establishing affiliates across Africa and Asia.</p>, <p>The fundamental obligation of a President, in my opinion, is to defend and protect America, not against threats of 2001, but against the threats of 2021 and tomorrow. That is the guiding principle behind my decisions about Afghanistan. I simply do not believe that the safety and security of America is enhanced by continuing to deploy thousands of American troops and spending billions of dollars a year in Afghanistan.</p>, <p>But I also know that the threat from terrorism continues in its pernicious and evil nature. But it's changed, expanded to other countries. Our strategy has to change too. We will maintain the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan and other countries. We just don't need to fight a ground war to do it. We have what's called over-the-horizon capabilities, which means we can strike terrorists and targets without American boots on the ground—or very few, if needed.</p>, <p>We've shown that capacity just in the last week. We struck ISIS-K remotely, days after they murdered 13 of our servicemembers and dozens of innocent Afghans. And to ISIS-K: We are not done with you yet.</p>, <p>As Commander in Chief, I firmly believe the best path to guard our safety and our security lies in a tough, unforgiving, targeted, precise strategy that goes after terror where it is today, not where it was two decades ago. That's what's in our national interest.</p>, <p>And here's a critical thing to understand: The world is changing. We're engaged in a serious competition with China. We're dealing with the challenges on multiple fronts with Russia. We're confronted with cyber attacks and nuclear proliferation.</p>, <p>We have to shore up America's competitive [competitiveness]* to meet these new challenges in the competition for the 21st century. And we can do both: fight terrorism and take on new threats that are here now and will continue to be here in the future. And there's nothing China or Russia would rather have, would want more, in this competition than the United States to be bogged down another decade in Afghanistan.</p>, <p>As we turn the page on the foreign policy that has guided our Nation the last two decades, we've got to learn from our mistakes. To me, there are two that are paramount. First, we must set missions with clear, achievable goals, not ones we'll never reach. And second, we must stay clearly focused on the fundamental national security interest of the United States of America.</p>, <p>This decision about Afghanistan is not just about Afghanistan, it's about ending an era of major military operations to remake other countries. We saw a mission of counterterrorism in Afghanistan—getting the terrorists and stopping attacks—morph into a counterinsurgency, nation building, trying to create a democratic, cohesive, and unified Afghanistan, something that has never been done over the many centuries of Afghans' [Afghanistan's]* history.</p>, <p>Moving on from that mindset and those kind of large-scale troop deployments will make us stronger and more effective and safer at home.</p>, <p>And for anyone who gets the wrong idea, let me say it clearly. To those who wish America harm, to those that engage in terrorism against us and our allies, know this: The United States will never rest. We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down to the ends of the Earth, and we will—you will pay the ultimate price.</p>, <p>And let me be clear: We will continue to support the Afghan people through diplomacy, international influence, and humanitarian aid. We'll continue to push for regional diplomacy and engagement to prevent violence and instability. We'll continue to speak out for basic rights of the Afghan people, especially women and girls, as we speak out for women and girls all around the globe. And I've been clear that human rights will be the center of our foreign policy.</p>, <p>But the way to do that is not through endless military deployments, but through diplomacy, economic tools, and rallying the rest of the world for support.</p>, <p>My fellow Americans, the war in Afghanistan is now over. I'm the fourth President who has faced the issue of whether and when to end this war. When I was running for President, I made a commitment to the American people that I would end this war. And today I've honored that commitment. It was time to be honest with the American people again. We no longer had a clear purpose in an open-ended mission in Afghanistan.</p>, <p>After 20 years of war in Afghanistan, I refused to send another generation of America's sons and daughters to fight a war that should have ended long ago.</p>, <p>After more than $2 trillion spent in Afghanistan—a cost that researchers at Brown University estimated would be over $300 million a day for 20 years in Afghanistan—for two decades—yes, the American people should hear this: $300 million a day for two decades.</p>, <p>If you take the number of $1 trillion, as many say, that's still $150 million a day for two decades. And what have we lost as a consequence in terms of opportunities? I refused to continue in a war that was no longer in the service of the vital national interest of our people.</p>, <p>And most of all, after 800,000 Americans serving in Afghanistan—I've traveled that whole country—brave and honorable service; after 20,744 American service men and women injured and the loss of 2,461 American personnel, including 13 lives lost just this week, I refused to open another decade of warfare in Afghanistan.</p>, <p>We've been a nation too long at war. If you're 20 years old today, you have never known an America at peace. So, when I hear that we could have, should have, continued the so-called low-grade effort in Afghanistan, at low risk to our servicemembers, at low cost, I don't think enough people understand how much we have asked of the 1 percent of this country who put that uniform on, who are willing to put their lives on the line in defense of our Nation.</p>, <p>Maybe it's because my deceased son, Beau, served in Iraq for a full year, before that—well—maybe it's because of what I've seen over the years as Senator, Vice President, and President traveling these countries.</p>, <p>A lot of our veterans and their families have gone through hell: deployment after deployment, months and years away from their families; missed birthdays, anniversaries; empty chairs at holidays; financial struggles; divorces; loss of limbs; traumatic brain injury; posttraumatic stress.</p>, <p>We see it in the struggles many have when they come home. We see it in the strain on their families and caregivers. We see it in the strain of their families when they're not there. We see it in the grief borne by their survivors. The cost of war they will carry with them their whole lives.</p>, <p>Most tragically, we see it in the shocking and stunning statistic that should give pause to anyone who thinks war can ever be low-grade, low-risk, or low-cost: 18 veterans, on average, who die by suicide every single day in America, not in a far-off place, but right here in America.</p>, <p>There's nothing low-grade or low-risk or low-cost about any war. It's time to end the war in Afghanistan. As we close 20 years of war and strife and pain and sacrifice, it's time to look to the future, not the past: to a future that's safer, to a future that's more secure, to a future that honors those who served and all those who gave what President Lincoln called their ""last full measure of devotion.""</p>, <p>I give you my word: With all of my heart, I believe this is the right decision, a wise decision, and the best decision for America.</p>, <p>Thank you. Thank you, and may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.</p>]"
11,3,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks During a Virtual Briefing on Hurricane Ida Damage and Recovery Efforts,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-during-virtual-briefing-hurricane-ida-damage-and-recovery-efforts,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good afternoon, everybody. We're waiting for a few more people to get on, but we're going to get started if that's okay with you all. And thanks for joining me. I'm here—the FEMA Director is on. FEMA Director Criswell, she's on. And I'm here with my Senior Adviser and boy who knows Louisiana very, very well, man—and New Orleans and—Cedric Richmond.</p>, <p>And what I'm going to do is make a brief statement here and then go through and tell you what we're doing, but then hear from all of you, if that's okay. I know you're busy as the devil.</p>, <p>I know you've got a lot to manage in your States, but the fact is that I want to hear from you; we both want to hear from you. And we know Hurricane Ida had the potential to cause massive, massive damage, and that's exactly what we saw. We already know there's been at least one confirmed death, and a number—that number is likely to grow. And I've got—we've got a million people in Louisiana without power.</p>, <p>And, for a time, Ida caused the Mississippi River to literally change its direction, and some folks are still dealing with the storm surge and flash flooding. And there are roads that are impassable due to debris and downed power lines. And we need people to continue to shelter in place if it's safe for them to do so. And for those who have lost their homes, you know, States, working with the American Red Cross, have already opened 50 shelters in affected areas across the Gulf Coast.</p>, <p>We've already begun search-and-rescue efforts, and we get folks who—out there who need assistance. And we're doing our—the best we can. More than 5,000 members of your National Guard have been activated from Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas to support search-and-rescue and recovery efforts.</p>, <p>And FEMA has prepositioned literally millions of meals and liters of water. They're already prepositioned, as well as other resources, in the immediate area. And we've deployed more than 200 generators, and we already moved into the region; they've been moved in ahead of time. And the Administrator Criswell and her team at FEMA is working getting more of those into the area.</p>, <p>We're in close contact with local electric providers to see what they need. They're all private providers; we don't control that. But we're doing all we can to minimize the amount of time it's going to take to get power back up for everyone in the region. And we've been working with the electric sector throughout the night and all day today to assess and understand the full extent of the damage.</p>, <p>To accelerate the process, I've asked the Federal Aviation Administration to work today with Louisiana and Mississippi electric companies to authorize the use of surveillance drones to assess Ida's damage to energy infrastructure, while ensuring those flights do not disrupt aerial search-and-rescue operations.</p>, <p>And I've also asked the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security to immediately make available any satellite imagery that can assist in assessing the damage in your States and cities and parishes.</p>, <p>Local utilities are going to soon begin restoration work, including prioritizing getting transmission lines into New Orleans and get them back up and running. A lot of them have been taken down. More than 25,000 debris crews and linemen from at least 30 States are rolling in to support you. Some are already prepositioned and close and, hopefully, are already underway.</p>, <p>But we need to be prepared and—that—we're about as prepared as we could be for the early stage of this, and there's a lot more to do.</p>, <p>We also know a lot of people lost their cell phone service if their particular carrier tower is down or damaged. So this morning the Federal Communications Commission has worked with the cellular providers to initiate their cooperative framework agreement. That agreement allows customers on one line—with one provider to go to another provider if that provider is down. So it allows customers to use roaming access [across]* carriers—to any of the carriers that are up and running. And that means you should be able to get a signal no matter who your carrier was or is.</p>, <p>The main thing I want to make clear to all of you is, we're providing any help we—that you're going to need. And so I've got—as I said, I've got my Senior Adviser, Cedric Richmond, here with me. You all know him. He's a New Orleans native, he's a Congressman of Louisiana—was a Congressman from Louisiana's Second District for 10 years. He knows the area. He knows the people, and he—who have been affected by Ida. And he knows how to get things done in government.</p>, <p>While FEMA is our lead for on-the-ground response, if there is something you need—needs my attention, Cedric is your direct line—direct line—into the White House throughout this recovery. And I mean that. Whatever you need, go to Cedric. He'll get to me, and we'll get you what you need, if we can.</p>, <p>The people of Louisiana and Mississippi are resilient and—but it's in moments like these that we can certainly see the power of government to respond to the needs of the people if the government is prepared and if they respond. That's our job, if we work together. The folks get knocked down; we're there to help you get back on your feet.</p>, <p>The most important element, though, is coordinating all the branches of government—State, local, and Federal. And that's what we're trying to make sure that we tried to do even before this hurricane hit. That's why we began working together—we're going to stand with you and the people of the Gulf as long as it takes for you to recover.</p>, <p>And so I'm now going to turn this over to John Bel, Governor Edwards of Louisiana. And, Governor, give us your assessment of what you have, what you're seeing out there. Tell me what you're hearing and what your team on the ground—and anything you need that we haven't gotten to you.</p>, <p><i>Governor John Bel Edwards of Louisiana.</i> Thank you very much, Mr. President. And you couldn't have picked a better person than Cedric Richmond, and we look forward to working with him as well.</p>, <p>First of all, let me thank you for signing my request for a prelandfall declaration and then, last night, signing the major disaster declaration. That's going to be very helpful.</p>, <p>Hurricane Ida came onshore with everything that was advertised——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Edwards. </i>——the surge, the rain, the wind.</p>, <p>The good news, first, is, all of our levee systems, particularly our Federal levee systems and hurricane risk reduction systems, performed magnificently. They were not overtopped. None of them were breached. Even our levee systems that were paid for with State and local funding in Lafourche and Terrebonne Parish performed extremely well. It would be a different story altogether had any of those levee systems failed.</p>, <p>Having said that, the damage is still catastrophic, but it was primarily wind-driven. But we know that there were some areas that received tremendous rainfall as well. But we're going to be dealing with this damage for quite a while.</p>, <p>And you mentioned the power outage. That is critical for us. And it's really a million homes and businesses that are out. And it's—my best guess is, you're getting closer to 2 million people without electricity right now.</p>, <p>And of course, we're trying to prioritize the restoration so that our hospitals come back up first.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Edwards.</i> Because while they're all on generator power, generators typically, you know, fail after some period of time. So we want to get them back up first. And in the meantime, we already have the Corps of Engineers on the ground identifying additional generators that we can bring to these hospital locations so that should we have a failure before power is restored, we're going to be able to switch them over. And they're working extremely hard on that.</p>, <p>[<i>Gov. Edwards continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>And the last thing I want to say is, the very first rescues occurred at a hospital in Galliano, down in Lafourche Parish, by the U.S. Coast Guard, because they were able to fly before any other assets could. And they were able to move about seven patients from a hospital down there. You probably saw the hospital that had the roof just completely——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Edwards. </i>——you know, taken off yesterday. Your Coast Guard rescued and relocated those patients first thing this morning, and we are very appreciative of that.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, thank you. Well, look, I wanted—we worked real hard with you to get the search-and-rescue teams in place. But they—you say they have been able to respond——</p>, <p><i>Gov. Edwards.</i> Yes, sir.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> ——in a timely way.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Edwards.</i> Yes, sir. And I'm—I can't tell you they're everywhere we want them, but they started responding first thing this morning. And those 16 teams, that doesn't include the National Guard——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Edwards.</i> ——or the Wildlife and Fisheries officers here.</p>, <p>You know, I've got all 5,000 of my National Guardsmen activated. We're going to end up with about 5,000 more coming in from out of State through an EMAC request. And one of the reasons this is important, Mr. President, is, we've got 2,400 of our soldiers in our 256th Brigade Infantry Combat Team, they're deployed to the Middle East.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Edwards. </i>And so we're going to have EMAC requests where, I think as early as tomorrow, we're going to have additional soldiers coming from National Guards from sister States, and that's going to be very helpful as well.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, good. Well, look, if there's anything else you need, you know you just call. I mean, you've got the team at the table there—a lot of them—and so just holler.</p>, <p>All right, now, Cedric, who are we going to next?</p>, <p><i>White House Director of Public Engagement Cedric L. Richmond.</i> Governor Reeves.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Is—oh, you are. I understand, Gov, you're not on video, but you are on the telephone. So, Gov, fire away.</p>, <p><i>Governor Tate Reeves of Mississippi.</i> Well, thank you, Mr. President. When we spoke on Friday, you assured me that when we asked for the prelandfall declaration, that you would immediately sign it, and you did exactly that, and I want to thank you for doing so. We're in a little bit of a different position right now, obviously, than our friends in Louisiana.</p>, <p>[<i>Gov. Reeves continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>We believe our State and local assets can meet the needs. And so we have encouraged our FEMA counterparts to release those individuals over to Louisiana to help with the search and rescue.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Good.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Reeves.</i> As well as, I have directed General Boyles, my adjutant general, as we progress over the next 8 to 10 hours—he has already reached out to his counterpart in Louisiana, and we're going to be sending men and women in uniform from Mississippi to help in Louisiana because that's just—that's who we are.</p>, <p>And so we've got, again, some—about 20 hours ahead of us of winds and lots and lots of rain. But all things considered, because the storm slowed up so considerably, we're seeing more rain—more rain, more water, but a lot less wind, which is certainly helpful.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, thanks an awful lot, Gov. And again, thanks for your generosity in sending some of those search and rescue teams to Louisiana.</p>, <p>And is Mayor Cantrell on? Mayor Cantrell, are you on? I don't think she was able to get connected.</p>, <p><i>Director Richmond.</i> I don't think so, Mr. President, but we have Cynthia Lee Sheng——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, okay.</p>, <p><i>Director Richmond.</i> —who is the Parish President from Jefferson Parish, which includes Grand Isle and other places hard hit.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> You were hard hit, weren't you, Madam President?</p>, <p><i>President Cynthia Lee Sheng of Jefferson Parish, LA.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Especially down in Grand Isle.</p>, <p><i>Parish President Sheng.</i> Yes, we were. Thank you, Mr. President. Congressman, Governor, thank you.</p>, <p>We have not had contact with Grand Isle. Congressman, you know Mayor Camardelle. I talked to him yesterday evening. He thought 40 people were on the island—couldn't get them off—including some firefighters. We have not had contact with them since yesterday.</p>, <p>[<i>Parish</i> <i>President Sheng continued her remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>But some of the people in here who stayed during the storm and are okay, in the next couple days, they may want to get out, and it might be a best idea for them to get out because it's going to be difficult life for quite some time.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you, Madam President.</p>, <p><i>Parish President Sheng.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Cedric, what about the oil port?</p>, <p><i>Director Richmond.</i> Well, the Governor or Parish President Sheng could talk about that. The President is inquiring about the oil ports down in Port Fourchon and the effect and where we are there.</p>, <p><i>Parish President Sheng.</i> I personally do not have eyes on that situation. So, actually, the only—the visual I get is if I see something on the national news. But I don't have word about that.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you.</p>]"
11,4,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Following a Briefing on Hurricane Ida Preparedness Efforts at the Federal Emergency Management Agency,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-briefing-hurricane-ida-preparedness-efforts-the-federal-emergency,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Well, folks, you've got your hands full, but you've done an incredible job so far in prepping for this.</p>, <p>You know, Jill and I are just getting back from Dover Air Force Base, up in my home State, where we met with the families of 13 fallen heroes in Afghanistan who lost their lives in the service of our country. And while we're praying for the best in Louisiana, let's keep them in our prayers as well.</p>, <p>I've just been briefed by the FEMA leadership—and we have real leadership—on Hurricane Ida and the preparations for rescue and response. And the storm has made—as you know better than anyone, but I'm speaking to the public at large here—the storm made landfall a few hours ago, and it continues to rage and ravage everything it comes in contact with.</p>, <p>And the storm is a life-threatening storm. Governor Edwards, an old friend, has characterized it as one of the strongest hurricanes—the strongest in Louisiana history since 1850. And its devastation is likely to be immense. We shouldn't kid ourselves.</p>, <p>And so the most important thing I can say right now is that everyone should listen to the instructions from local and State officials just how dangerous this is and take it seriously. It's not just the coast. It's not just New Orleans. It's north as well. The rainfall is expected to be exceedingly high.</p>, <p>And to the people of the Gulf Coast: I want you to know that we're praying for the best and planning—prepared for the worst. As soon as the storm passes, we're going to put this—we're going to put the country's full might behind the rescue and recovery. And I mean that.</p>, <p>I've been around for a lot of hurricanes. And I'm no expert, but I've been around for a lot of hurricanes, and I don't think we've ever had as much preparation: long-term preparation with the levee system and preparation here.</p>, <p>Thanks to the Administrator's leadership and the hard work of the FEMA team—all of whom are gathered behind me—many of whom are gathered behind me—we've already prepositioned resources that we know are going to be needed and equipment and response teams in the region.</p>, <p>This includes 2.5 million meals and 3 million liters of water. We've got generators in place, and we're in close touch with the power providers to get and restore power as soon as possible because a lot of it—a lot of it's going to go out. And we should be prepared that it can take a long time, no matter how much we've prepositioned—which we have—that it's going to take a long time for a lot of it to get back up. It could take a matter of weeks for some places.</p>, <p>We've got 13 Urban Search and Rescue teams—for those of you who aren't familiar with that, they're—these teams make up about 70 people and experts—each of these teams—and they can do real, serious recovery work.</p>, <p>More than 100 ambulances and emergency medical teams have been activated. And we're working with the Red Cross and local partners to open dozens and dozens of shelters with cots and blankets and meals to support those we need to evacuate. That will happen mostly in the northern part of the State and maybe in parts of Mississippi.</p>, <p>And I've already signed an emergency declaration for both Louisiana as well as Mississippi. And I want to make sure that we're ready to surge all the response capacity—capability that we have to deal with whatever comes next. And a lot's going to be coming.</p>, <p>I've been in touch with the Governors of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. And my team at the White House has been in touch with other State, local, and Federal officials in the region. And they know—they know—there will be the full resources and support of the Federal Government.</p>, <p>So I want to emphasize again: This is going to be a devastating—a devastating—hurricane, a life-threatening storm. So, please, all you folks in Mississippi and—in Louisiana, Mississippi, and, God knows, maybe even further east, take precautions. Listen. Take it seriously—really, very seriously.</p>, <p>And you know, the whole-of-Government effort is ready to get to work. I can't think of any time where the Federal, State, and local folks have worked together more closely and in advance of an obvious significant natural disaster. And folks, we're going to be here. We're going to be here to help the Gulf region get back on its feet as quickly as possible, as long as it takes—as long as it takes.</p>, <p>So thank you, and may God protect those in the path of the storm. And God willing, we'll get through this sooner than later.</p>, <p>But don't kid yourself; this is going to take a lot of resources, a little bit of luck, and as my grandfather would say, ""The grace of God and the good will of the neighbors."" And by the way, look out for your neighbors. If you're in the region, look out for your neighbors.</p>, <p>So thank you very much, and thank you, Commissioner. And I really think it all works.</p>, <p>I'm not supposed to take any questions, but go ahead.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, on Afghanistan——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm not going to answer Afghanistan now.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Can you say if there's still an acute——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Okay.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>——risk at the airport, sir?</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President addressed Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) staff.</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>Thank you. Really and truly, thank you, thank you, thank you. I know there's no group of Americans who know how dangerous it is more than you guys do. So let's stay at it to the very end. I know you will.</p>, <p>You've done everything you can to help prepare these folks. But I tell you what, it's—I think we're going to be take—they're going to be taking a look at additional levee systems a little further south before this is over. So thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>, <p>And I promise you, the Governor is truly, truly, truly appreciative. You're probably never going to meet him, but he's a good guy. He's really appreciative. Thank you.</p>]"

Biden,Remarks Prior to a Virtual Federal Emergency Management Agency Briefing on Preparedness Efforts for Hurricane Ida,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-virtual-federal-emergency-management-agency-briefing-preparedness-efforts,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody. Can you all hear me?</p>, <p><i>Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Bennett Criswell.</i> We can, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well——</p>, <p><i>Administrator Criswell.</i> Can you hear me?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I can hear you clearly.</p>, <p>Let me begin by thanking you all, every one of you, for the incredible work you're doing. You know, and I want to thank you for joining me on this call today. And I know so many of you have been working flat out, nights and weekends, for a long time now.</p>, <p>Hurricane Ida is coming fast on the heels of a tragic flooding in Tennessee, Tropical Storm Henri, and you've all been part of a COVID-19 response for so many months now. You've been overwhelmed, but you don't show it. You've been incredible. Thank you.</p>, <p>You know, Ida is turning into a very, very dangerous storm; I need not tell you. I just got another briefing from the Hurricane Center and, as you know, it's now heading straight for—right toward Louisiana.</p>, <p>This weekend is the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. And it's a stark reminder that we have to do everything we can to prepare the people in the region and make sure we're ready to respond.</p>, <p>Administrator Criswell, you and I have spoken extensively about this. We were together yesterday, and we spoke to the Governors of Louisiana, of Alabama, and Mississippi to ask what they need from us before the storm arrived. And I've already signed an emergency declaration for Louisiana to make sure we're ready for the surge response capability to deal with whatever comes our—their way—our way, but it's their way.</p>, <p>You know, we've deployed 500 FEMA emergency response personnel in Texas and Louisiana, in addition to 2,000 FEMA personnel already supporting our COVID response in the region. And we've prepositioned food, water, generators, and other supplies in the area. Power restoration and mobile communication support teams are also en route. We've also closely coordinated with the electric utilities to restore power as soon as possible and to support your response and recovery efforts.</p>, <p>And above all, I'm urging the people of the area to pay attention and be prepared. I want to say it again: to pay attention and be prepared. Have supplies for your household on hand. Follow the guidance from local authorities. And if you have to move to shelter, make sure you wear a mask and try to keep some distance because we're still facing the highly contagious Delta variant as well.</p>, <p>Administration Criswell—Administrator Criswell, you're, you know—I'm going to turn this over to you in a moment here to give an update on the latest steps we're taking. And I want you to know what more can—I need to know everything you think we need to be able to do. If you haven't gotten the authority for it, tell me now. We'll get it done. It's like—most importantly, I just want to say to all of you: Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>, <p>Everything you're doing to prepare for this dangerous storm is going to mitigate the impact of potential natural disasters, results that are going to be visited on so many people in the region. The work you're doing is vital, and you all know it.</p>, <p>So, Administrator Criswell, let's you and I have a conversation. Tell me what you need and what's going on.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the briefing began, and no transcript was provided.</i>]</p>]"
11,6,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-prime-minister-naftali-bennett-israel,"[<p><i>President Biden.</i> Welcome, folks. It's a delight to have the Prime Minister here. I know there's going to be—we're going to talk about our relationship, which is as strong as can be. But I know you're going to want to know what's happened this morning in terms of my meetings with our—my national security team.</p>, <p><i>Terrorist Attack at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, on August 26 </i></p>, <p>Let me begin by once again acknowledging the bravery and the sacrifice that our military makes every single day. And the loss of those Americans and marines and sailor and Army personnel is tragic.</p>, <p>As I said yesterday, and the Prime Minister and I talked about it slightly—he's a military man; gone to war, lost a friend—you know, losing a son, a daughter, a husband, a wife, is like being sucked into a big black hole in the middle of your chest, and you don't think there's any way out—you wonder what's happening. So my heart goes out—our hearts go out—to all those who we've lost.</p>, <p>But look, the mission there being performed is dangerous, and it is now—it's come with a significant loss of American personnel. And—but it's a worthy mission because they continue to evacuate folks out of that region, out of the airport. We've evacuated more than 12,000 additional people out of the airport in the last 24 hours.</p>, <p>I met with my commanders this morning, first thing in the morning. I got a detailed briefing about yesterday's attacks and the measures they're taking to protect our forces and complete the mission. And we will complete the mission.</p>, <p>Now, I'm not going to take any questions, because of the Prime Minister being here, on Afghanistan now, but I'll be available at another time.</p>, <p><i>The President's Meeting With Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel </i></p>, <p>But it's great to have the Prime Minister here. We—he—we've become close friends. He's ridden the Amtrak train a lot—[<i>laughter</i>]—from New York down to Wilmington, Delaware—I told you we have a few corporations in Delaware—back in the days when he was in private practice.</p>, <p>And—but he heads and leads the most diverse government in Israeli history. And we've got a big agenda today, starting with COVID—which we've been talking about—and—19—and both our successful vaccination programs.</p>, <p>And we've talked a little bit—and we're going to continue to talk—about the issue of booster shots. And they—you started your program a little early. It's been met with great results. And we're going to start mid-September, but we're considering the advice you've given that we should start earlier.</p>, <p>And this is promising also—this booster program is going to start here on September the 20th, pending approval of the FDA and then a CDC committee of outside experts. And the question raised is: Should it be shorter than 8 months? Should it be as little as 5 months? And that's being discussed. I spoke with Dr. Fauci this morning about that.</p>, <p>We're also going to discuss Israel's unwavering—unwavering commitment that we have in the United States to Israel's security. And I fully, fully, fully support replenishing Israel's Iron Dome system.</p>, <p>And we also are going to discuss the threat from Iran and our commitment to ensure Iran never develops a nuclear weapon. And—but we're putting diplomacy first and seeing where that takes us.</p>, <p>But if diplomacy fails, we're ready to turn to other options. We'll support Israel's developing deeper ties, as well, with the Arab and Muslim neighbors and globally. That's a trend that I think should be encouraged and not discouraged. And we're going to do all we can to be value added.</p>, <p>We also are going to discuss ways to advance peace and security and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians. And we're also going to direct our teams to work toward Israel fulfilling the requirements of the visa waiver program and get that done.</p>, <p>So, Mr. Prime Minister, I want to thank you again for coming. The U.S. will always be there for Israel. It's an unshakeable partnership between our two nations. And I've known every Israeli Prime Minister since Golda Meir and gotten to know them fairly well. And I look forward to us establishing a strong, personal relationship.</p>, <p>So, welcome. Welcome.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Bennett.</i> Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, on behalf of the Israeli people, I want to extend our condolences and deep sadness for the loss of American lives in Kabul. The American servicemembers lost their lives while on a mission to save other people's lives, and that's the very definition of courage and sacrifice. May they rest in peace. Especially on this day, I want to be crystal clear: Israel always stands together with the United States of America unequivocally.</p>, <p>I also want to thank you for your warm words now and in our private meeting, which attests to your support of the State of Israel. But that's not new; it's been decades. And you've always stood up for us, especially during tough times, like a few months ago when thousands of rockets were being shot on Israeli towns and cities. And that's when friendship is really tested. We trust in your support, Mr. President. And Israel knows that we have no better or more reliable ally in the world than the United States of America.</p>, <p>I come here from Jerusalem, our eternal capital. And I bring with me a new spirit, a spirit of good will, a spirit of hope, a spirit of decency and honesty, a spirit of unity and bipartisanship of folks who, as you suggested, harbor very different political opinions, even opposing. Yet we all share the deep passion to work together to build a better future for Israel. And that's what Israel is about.</p>, <p>We're out to be good, to do good. But in our region, doing good is not enough. Israel has to be strong in order to do good. Be strong so we can do good.</p>, <p>And we cannot lose sight for even one moment that we're in the toughest neighborhood in the world. We've got ISIS on our southern border, Hizballah on our northern border, Islamic Jihad, Hamas, Iranian militias that surround us. And all of them want to kill—kill us, kill Israelis. They all want to annihilate the Jewish state. And that's why Israel always has to be overwhelming strong—overwhelmingly stronger than any of our enemies and, indeed, of all our enemies combined.</p>, <p>And that's why I want to thank you, Mr. President, for helping, yet again, to fortify Israel's strategic advantage.</p>, <p>Obviously, the main issue we're going to be talking about today here is Iran's race to a nuclear weapon. We talked about it inside the room, and I was happy to hear your clear words that Iran will never be able to acquire a nuclear weapon and that you emphasized that you'll try the diplomatic route, but there's other options if that doesn't work out.</p>, <p>So, you know, these very days illustrate what the world would look like. If a radical Islamic regime acquired a nuclear weapon, that marriage would be a nuclear nightmare for the entire world. Iran is the world's number-one exporter of terror, instability, and human right violations. And as we sit here right now, the Iranians are spinning their centrifuges in Natanz and Fordow, but we've got to stop it. And we both agree.</p>, <p>So we've developed a comprehensive strategy that we're going to be talking about with two goals: The first goal is to stop Iran on its regional aggression and start rolling it back into the box; and the second is to permanently keep Iran away from ever being able to break out to a nuclear weapon.</p>, <p>As I told you, Mr. President, Israel never had and never will ask America to send troops to defend ourselves. That's our job. We will never outsource our security. It's our responsibility to take care of our fate. But we do thank you for the tools and the back you've been giving us and you're giving us.</p>, <p>As you said, we're also going to be talking about COVID and the Delta variant, which is wreaking havoc across the world. You were the first to call the pandemic ""the pandemic of the unvaccinated,"" and that is—could not be more true.</p>, <p>Just about a month ago, I took a very tough decision, a policy decision, that Israel would pioneer the booster shot, the third shot. I can report to you, Mr. President, and to everyone, that we've reached almost 3 million Israelis that have received the booster shot. And the bottom line is, it's safe, and it works. The good news, finally, is that the tide is turning in Israel.</p>, <p>And one last word, Mr. President—I'll take this off for this part, if I may: You're a man of faith, as am I. In the synagogues across the world, we read a biblical portion; beyond the Parsha, it's called the Haftarah. And tomorrow we're going to be reading words of the prophet Isaiah—Yesha'yahu. In Hebrew, the words are——</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, Prime Minister Bennett spoke in Hebrew. He then resumed his remarks in English as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>What this means—I can say anything now. Right? [<i>Laughter</i>] What this means is, the sons and daughters of the Jewish people are going to come back to our land, are going to nurse our ancient land and rebuild it. And this ancient Jewish prophecy is today's Israel reality. And I—it's a miracle that you've been so central and so part of it for so many years.</p>, <p>So, Mr. President, today, you and I—and you've been so generous with your time in these difficult days—you and I are going to write yet another chapter in the beautiful story of the friendship between our two nations, the United States of America and the Jewish and democratic State of Israel, both of us who seek to do good and need to be strong, both of us who are a lighthouse in a very, very stormy world.</p>, <p>Thank you, Mr. President. I look forward to working with you now and for many years forward. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Well, thank you. And you give me credit, much of which should go to Barack Obama, for making sure that we committed to a qualitative edge you would have relative to your friends in the region. So he's the one that deserves the credit.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Bennett.</i> Thank him as well.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Thank you very much, folks.</p>]"
11,7,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks on the Terrorist Attack at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, and an Exchange With Reporters",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-terrorist-attack-hamid-karzai-international-airport-kabul-afghanistan-and,"[<p><i>The President.</i> It's been a tough day. This evening in Kabul, as you all know, terrorists attacked—that we've been talking about and worried about, that the intelligence community has assessed has [was]* undertaken—an attack—by a group known as ISIS-K—took the lives of American servicemembers standing guard at the airport, and wounded several others seriously. They also wounded a number of civilians, and civilians were killed as well.</p>, <p>I've been engaged all day and in constant contact with the military commanders here in Washington, the Pentagon, as well as in Afghanistan and Doha. And my commanders here in Washington and in the field have been on this with great detail, and you've had a chance to speak to some, so far. The situation on the ground is still evolving, and I'm constantly being updated.</p>, <p>These American servicemembers who gave their lives—it's an overused word, but it's totally appropriate here—were heroes. Heroes who have been engaged in a dangerous, selfless mission to save the lives of others. They were part of an airlift, an evacuation effort unlike any seen in history, with more than 100,000 American citizens, American partners, Afghans who helped us, and others taken to safety in the last 11 days. Just in the last 12 hours or so, another 7,000 have gotten out.</p>, <p>They were part of the bravest, most capable, and the most selfless military on the face of the Earth. And they were part of, simply, what I call the ""backbone of America."" They're the spine of America, the best the country has to offer.</p>, <p>Jill and I—our hearts ache, like I'm sure all of you do as well, for all those Afghan families who have lost loved ones, including small children, or been wounded in this vicious attack. And we're outraged as well as heartbroken.</p>, <p>Being the father of an Army major who served for a year in Iraq and, before that, was in Kosovo as a U.S. attorney for the better part of 6 months in the middle of a war—when he came home after a year in Iraq, he was diagnosed, like many, many coming home, with an aggressive and lethal cancer of the brain—who we lost.</p>, <p>We have some sense, like many of you do, of what the families of these brave heroes are feeling today. You get this feeling like you're being sucked into a black hole in the middle of your chest; there's no way out. My heart aches for you. But I know this: We have a continuing obligation, a sacred obligation to all of you, the families of those heroes. That obligation is not temporary; it lasts forever.</p>, <p>The lives we lost today were lives given in the service of liberty, the service of security, in the service of others, in the service of America. Like their fellow brothers-and-sisters-in-arms who died defending our vision and our values in the struggle against terrorism of—the fallen this day, they're part of a great and noble company of American heroes.</p>, <p>To those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay. I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my command.</p>, <p>Over the past few weeks—I know you're—many of you are probably tired of hearing me say it—we've been made aware by our intelligence community that the ISIS-K—an archenemy of the Taliban; people who were freed when both those prisons were opened—has been planning a complex set of attacks on the United States personnel and others.</p>, <p>This is why, from the outset, I've repeatedly said this mission was extraordinarily dangerous and why I have been so determined to limit the duration of this mission. And as General McKenzie said, this is why our mission was designed—this is the way it was designed to operate: operate under severe stress and attack. We've known that from the beginning.</p>, <p>And as I've been in constant contact with our senior military leaders—and I mean constant, around the clock—and our commanders on the ground and throughout the day, they made it clear that we can and we must complete this mission, and we will. And that's what I've ordered them to do. We will not be deterred by terrorists. We will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuation.</p>, <p>I've also ordered my commanders to develop operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership, and facilities. We will respond with force and precision at our time, at the place we choose, and the moment of our choosing.</p>, <p>Here is what you need to know: These ISIS terrorists will not win. We will rescue the Americans who are there. We will get out our Afghan allies out, and our mission will go on. America will not be intimidated. And I have the utmost confidence in our brave service members who continue to execute this mission with courage and honor to save lives and get Americans, our partners, our Afghan allies out of Afghanistan.</p>, <p>Every day when I talk to our commanders, I ask them what they need, what more do they need, if anything, to get the job done. As they will tell you, I granted every request. I reiterated to them again today, on three occasions, that they should take the maximum steps necessary to protect our forces on the ground in Kabul.</p>, <p>And I also want to thank the Secretary of Defense and the military leadership at the Pentagon and all the commanders in the field. There has been complete unanimity from every commander on the objectives of this mission and the best way to achieve those objectives.</p>, <p>Those who have served through the ages have drawn inspiration from the Book of Isaiah, when the Lord says, ""Whom shall I send . . . who shall go for us?"" And the American military has been answering for a long time: ""Here am I, Lord. Send me."" Here I am. Send me.</p>, <p>Each one of these women and men of our Armed Forces are the heirs of that tradition of sacrifice of volunteering to go into harm's way, to risk everything, not for glory, not for profit, but to defend what we love and the people we love.</p>, <p>And I ask that you join me now in a moment of silence for all those in uniform and out of uniform—military and civilian—who have given the last full measure of devotion.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President observed a moment of silence.</i>]</p>, <p>Thank you, may God bless you all, and may God protect those troops and all those standing watch for America. We have so much to do. It's within our capacity to do it. We just have to remain steadfast. Steadfast.</p>, <p>We will complete our mission. And we will continue, after our troops have withdrawn, to find means by which we defined any American who wishes to get out of Afghanistan. We will find them, and we will get them out.</p>, <p>Ladies and gentlemen, they gave me a list here. The first person I was instructed to call on was Kelly O'Donnell of NBC.</p>, <p><i>Withdrawal of U.S. Military Forces From Afghanistan/Potential Additional U.S. Military Support/U.S. Counterterrorism Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, you have said leaving Afghanistan is in the national interest of the United States. After today's attack, do you believe you will authorize additional forces to respond to that attack inside Afghanistan? And are you—are you prepared to add additional forces to protect those Americans who remain on the ground carrying out the evacuation operation?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I've instructed the military, whatever they need—if they need additional force—I will grant it. But the military—from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Joint Chiefs, the commanders in the field—have all contacted me one way or another, usually by letter, saying they subscribe to the mission as designed to get as many people out as we can within the timeframe that is allotted. That is the best way, they believe, to get as many Americans out as possible, and others.</p>, <p>And with regard to finding, tracking down the ISIS leaders who ordered this, we have some reason to believe we know who they are—not certain—and we will find ways of our choosing, without large military operations, to get them.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Inside Afghanistan, Mr. President?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Wherever they are.</p>, <p>Trevor [Trevor Hunnicutt, Reuters] from Reuters.</p>, <p><i>Taliban/Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you, Mr. President. There has been some criticism, even from people in your party, about the dependence on the Taliban to secure the perimeter of the airport. Do you feel like there was a mistake made in that regard?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I don't. Look, I think General McKenzie handled this question very well. The fact is that we're in a situation—we inherited a situation, particularly since, as we all know, that the Afghan military collapsed 11 days before—in 11 days—that it is in the interest of, as Mackenzie said, in the interest of the Taliban that, in fact, ISIS-K does not metastasize beyond what it is, number one. And number two, it's in their interest that we are able to leave on time, on target.</p>, <p>As a consequence of that, the major things we've asked them—moving back the perimeter; giving more space between the wall; stopping vehicles from coming through, et cetera; searching people coming through—it is not what you'd call a tightly commanded, regimented operation like the U.S. is—the military is—but they're acting in their interest—their interest.</p>, <p>And so, by and large—and I've asked this same question to military on the ground, whether or not it's a useful exercise. No one trusts them; we're just counting on their self-interest to continue to generate their activities. And it's in their self-interest that we leave when we said and that we get as many people out as we can.</p>, <p>And like I said, even in the midst of everything that happened today, over 7,000 people have gotten out, over 5,000 Americans overall.</p>, <p>So it's not a matter of trust, it's a matter of mutual self-interest. And—but there is no evidence thus far that I've been given, as a consequence, by any of our commanders in the field, that there has been collusion between the Taliban and ISIS in carrying out what happened today both in front of the hotel and what is expected to continue for—beyond today.</p>, <p>Aamer [Aamer Madhani], Associated Press.</p>, <p><i>Withdrawal of U.S. Military Forces From Afghanistan/Evacuation of U.S. Citizens and Afghan Allies From Afghanistan/Taliban </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you, Mr. President. You have spoken again powerfully about your own son and the weight of these decisions. With that in mind—and also what you've said: that the longer we stay, the more likelihood that there would be a major attack—how do you weigh staying even 1 more day, considering what's happened?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Because I think what America says matters. What we say we're going to do and the context in which we say we're going to do it, that we do it, unless something exceptional changes.</p>, <p>There are additional American citizens, there are additional green card holders, there are additional personnel of our allies, there are additional SIV card holders, there are additional Afghans that have helped us, and there are additional groups of individuals that have contacted us from women's groups, to NGOs, and others, who have expressly indicated they want to get out and have gathered in certain circumstances in groups, on buses and other means, that still presents the opportunity for the next several days, between now and the 31st, to be able to get them out.</p>, <p>And our military—and, I believe, to the extent that we can do that knowing the threat, knowing that we may very well have another attack—the military has concluded that's what we should do. I think they're right. I think they're correct.</p>, <p>And after that, we're going to be in a circumstance where there are—will be, I believe, numerous opportunities to continue to provide access for additional persons to get out of Afghanistan, either through means that we provide and/or are provided through cooperation with the Taliban.</p>, <p>They're not good guys, the Taliban. I'm not suggesting that at all. But they have a keen interest. As many of you have been reporting, they very much would like to figure out how to keep the airport open. They don't have the capacity to do it. They very much are trying to figure out whether or not they can maintain what is the portion of an economy that has become not robust, but fundamentally different than it had been.</p>, <p>And so there's a lot of reasons why they have reached out not just to us, but to others, as to why it would be continued in their interest to get more of the personnel we want to get out. We can locate them.</p>, <p>Now, there's not many left that we can assess that are—want to come out. There's some Americans we've identified—we've contacted the vast majority of them, if not all of them—who don't want to leave because they have—they're dual nationals, they have extended families, et cetera. And there's others who are looking for the time. So that's why we continue.</p>, <p>I'll take a few more questions, and—but, you, sir.</p>, <p><i>Evacuation of U.S. Citizens and Afghan Allies From Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I didn't pick you, but that's okay. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>I wanted to ask you—you say that ""what America says matters."" What do you say to the Afghans who helped troops, who may not be able to get out by August 31? What——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I say——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>What do you say to them?</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>——we're going to continue to try to get you out. It matters.</p>, <p>Look, I know of no conflict, as a student of history—no conflict where, when a war was ending, one side was able to guarantee that everyone that wanted to be extracted from that country would get out.</p>, <p>And think about it, folks. I think it's important for—I know the American people get this in their gut. There are, I would argue, millions of Afghani citizens who are not Taliban; who did not actively cooperate with us as SIVs; who, if given a chance, they'd be onboard a plane tomorrow. It sounds ridiculous, but the vast majority of people in communities like that want to come to America, given a choice.</p>, <p>So, getting every single person out is—can't be guaranteed to anybody because there's a determination, all who wants to get out as well.</p>, <p>At any rate, it's a process.</p>, <p>I was really pointing to you, but—you, sir.</p>, <p><i>Taliban/Evacuation of U.S. Citizens and Afghan Allies From Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you, Mr. President. There are reports that U.S. officials provided the Taliban with names of Americans and Afghan officials to evacuate. Were you aware of that? Did that happen?</p>, <p>And then, sir, did you personally reject a recommendation to hold or to recapture Bagram Air Force Base?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Here's what I've done on the—ask this—I'll answer the last question, first. On the tactical questions of how to conduct an evacuation or a war, I gather up all the major military personnel that are in Afghanistan, the commanders, as well as the Pentagon. And I ask for their best military judgment: what would be the most efficient way to accomplish the mission.</p>, <p>They concluded—the military—that Bagram was not much value added, that it was much wiser to focus on Kabul. And so I followed that recommendation.</p>, <p>With regard to—there are certain circumstances where we've gotten information—and quite frankly, sometimes from some of you—saying, ""You know of such and such a group of people who are trying to get out, and they're on a bus, they're moving""—from other people—""and this is their location.""</p>, <p>And there have been occasions when our military has contacted their military counterparts in the Taliban and said, ""This""—for example: ""This bus is coming through with x number of people on it, made up of the following group of people. We want you to let that bus or that group through."" So yes, there have been occasions like that.</p>, <p>And to the best of my knowledge, in those cases, the bulk of that has occurred; they've been let through. But I can't tell you with any certitude that there's actually been a list of names. I don't—there may have been, but I know of no circumstance. It doesn't mean it's not—it didn't exist, that: ""Here's the names of 12 people; they're coming. Let them through."" It could very well have happened.</p>, <p>I'll take one more question.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, can I——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, right here. Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Let me take the one question from the most interesting guy that I know in the press.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you, Mr. President. Is that—is there—thank you.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That's you. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Taliban/Terrorist Attack at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, there had not been a U.S. servicemember killed in combat in Afghanistan since February of 2020. You set a deadline. You pulled troops out. You sent troops back in. And now 12 marines are dead. You said the buck stops with you. Do you bear any responsibility for the way that things have unfolded in the last two weeks?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I bear responsibility for, fundamentally, all that's happened of late.</p>, <p>But here's the deal: You know—I wish you'd one day say these things—you know as well as I do that the former President made a deal with the Taliban that he would get all American forces out of Afghanistan by May 1.</p>, <p>In return, the commitment was made—and that was a year before—in return, he was given a commitment that the Taliban would continue to attack others, but would not attack any American forces.</p>, <p>Remember that? I'm being serious.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I'm asking you a question. Be a—because before I——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Donald Trump is not the President right now.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, no—now wait a minute. I'm asking you a question. Is that accurate, to the best of your knowledge?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>I know what you're talking about. But, Mr. President, respectfully——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> What?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>——since—I don't think that the issue that—do you think that people have an issue with pulling out of Afghanistan or just the way that things have happened?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I think they have an issue that people are likely to get hurt—some, as we've seen, have gotten killed—and that it is messy. The reason why—whether my friend will acknowledge it, in other words, reported it—the reason why there were no attacks on Americans, as you said, from the date until I came into office, was because the commitment was made by President Trump: ""I will be out by May 1. In the meantime, you agree not to attack any Americans."" That was the deal. That's why no American was attacked.</p>, <p><i>Timeline for the Withdrawal of U.S. Military Forces From Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>And you said that you still—a few days ago, you said you squarely stand by your decision to pull out.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, I do. Because look at it this way, folks—and I'm going to—I have another meeting, for real. But imagine where we'd be if I had indicated, on May the 1st, I was not going to renegotiate an evacuation date; we were going to stay there.</p>, <p>I'd have only one alternative: Pour thousands of more troops back into Afghanistan to fight a war that we had already won, relative—is why the reason we went in the first place.</p>, <p>I have never been of the view that we should be sacrificing American lives to try to establish a democratic government in Afghanistan, a country that has never once in its entire history been a united country and is made up—and I don't mean this in a derogatory—made up of different tribes who have never, ever, ever gotten along with one another.</p>, <p>And so, as I said before—and this is the last comment I'll make, but we'll have more chance to talk about this, unfortunately, beyond, because we're not out yet—if Usama bin Laden, as well as Al Qaida, had chosen to launch an attack—when they left Saudi Arabia—out of Yemen, would we have ever gone to Afghanistan? Even though the Taliban completely controlled Afghanistan at the time, would we have ever gone?</p>, <p>I know it's not fair to ask you questions. It's rhetorical. But raise your hand if you think we should have gone and given up thousands of lives and tens of thousands of wounded.</p>, <p>Our interest in going was to prevent Al Qaida from reemerging—first to get bin Laden, wipe out Al Qaida in Afghanistan, and prevent that from happening again.</p>, <p>As I've said a hundred times: Terrorism has metastasized around the world; we have greater threats coming out of other countries a heck of a lot closer to the United States. We don't have military encampments there; we don't keep people there. We have over-the-horizon capability to keep them from going after us.</p>, <p>Ladies and gentlemen, it was time to end a 20-year war.</p>, <p>Thank you so much.</p>]"
11,8,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on Cybersecurity and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-cybersecurity-and-exchange-with-reporters,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Well, thank you all for being here to discuss the core national security challenge we're facing, the American people are facing, and our economy is facing with cybersecurity. We've seen time and again how the technologies we rely on—from our cell phones to pipelines, to the electric grid—can become targets of hackers and criminals.</p>, <p>At the same time, our skilled cybersecurity workforce has not grown fast enough to keep pace. We're about—the estimates many of you have given us and we've concluded are—on our own—about a half a million cybersecurity jobs remain unfilled. That's a challenge, but it also is a real opportunity. And I've made it—this a priority for my administration from the outset.</p>, <p>And in May, I issued an Executive order to modernize our defenses and improve our Federal Government's cybersecurity. Because of that order, Government will only buy tech products that meet certain cybersecurity standards, which will have a ripple effect across the software industry, in our view, ultimately improving security for all Americans.</p>, <p>We've launched a hundred-day initiative to improve cybersecurity across the electric sector. That initiative has already resulted in more than 150 utilities that serve 90 million Americans being deployed. And we're committing to deploy cybersecurity technologies that are extending that initiative as—to gas pipelines as well, next. That's where we're going.</p>, <p>And because the cybersecurity is a global issue, we've also rallied G-7 countries to hold nations who harbor ransomware criminals accountable. And, I might add, I had a summit with Vladimir Putin and made it clear to him that we expected him to hold them accountable as well, because they know where they are and who they are. But that's another issue we will not be discussing so much today.</p>, <p>We updated NATO cyber policy for the first time in 7 years. And today my team is hosting a meeting, bringing together 30 of the nations—30 nations to step up in their fight against ransomware.</p>, <p>But the reality is, most of our critical infrastructure owned and operated—is owned and operated by the private sector, and the Federal Government can't meet this challenge alone.</p>, <p>So I've invited you all here today because you have the power, the capacity, and the responsibility, I believe, to raise the bar on cybersecurity.</p>, <p>And so, ultimately, we got a lot of work to do. And thank you all very much. And thank the press for being here. We're going to go private now.</p>, <p><i>Withdrawal of U.S. Military Forces From Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, if Americans are still in Afghanistan after the deadline, what will you do? Sir, what will you do if Americans are still there after the deadline? No? Okay.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> You'll be the first person I'll call.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Please call them.</p>]"
11,9,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on House of Representatives Passage of a Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2022 and Voting Rights Legislation and United States Evacuation Efforts in Afghanistan,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-house-representatives-passage-budget-resolution-for-fiscal-year-2022-and-voting,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Hello, folks. The—before I update you on the meeting that I had with leaders of the G-7 earlier today, I want to say a word about the progress we're making on the Build Back Better agenda here at home.</p>, <p>I just got off the telephone with the leaders in the House. Today the House of Representatives has taken a significant step toward making a historic investment that's going to transform America, cut taxes for working families, and position the American economy for long-term, long-term growth.</p>, <p>When I became President, it was clear that we had to confront an immediate economic crisis, the most significant recession we've had since the Depression or at least since Johnson. But we weren't going to—but that wasn't going to be enough.</p>, <p>We also had to make some long-term investments in Americans and America itself. The first thing we did was to write and pass the American Rescue Plan, and it's working. Our economy has added 4 million jobs in my first 6 months in office. Economic growth is up to the fastest it's been—the fastest rate in 40 years. And unemployment is coming down.</p>, <p>Right now our economic growth is leading the world's advanced economies. But to win the future, we need to take the next step. And today the House of Representatives did just that.</p>, <p>That—today's vote in the House allowed them to consider my Build Back Better agenda, a broad framework to make housing more affordable; bring down the cost of prescription drugs by giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for drugs; make eldercare more affordable; provide 2 years of free, universal, high-quality pre-K and 2 years of free community college; provide clean energy tax credits; continue to give the middle class families the well-deserved tax cut for daycare and health care that they deserve, allowing a lot of women to get back to work, primarily; and provide significant monthly tax cuts for working families with children through the childcare tax credit.</p>, <p>These investments are going to lower out-of-pocket expenses for families and not just give them a little more breathing room. In addition, we're going to make long-overdue, much-needed investments in basic, hard infrastructure of this Nation.</p>, <p>There—this is an area where we have broad, bipartisan agreement to invest in our antiquated roads, highways, bridges, transit, drinking water systems, broadband, clean energy, environmental cleanup, and making infrastructure more resilient to climate—to the climate crisis, and so much more.</p>, <p>And this is all paid for—instead of giving every break in the world to corporations and CEOs. By the way, 55 of our largest companies in America paid zero dollars in Federal taxes on more than $40 billion in profit last year.</p>, <p>We can ask corporations and the very wealthy just to pay their fair share. They can still be very wealthy. They can still make a lot of money, but just begin to pay their fair share so we can invest in making our country stronger and more competitive, create jobs and raise wages, and lift up the standard of living for everyone.</p>, <p>The bottom line is, in my view, we're a step closer to truly investing in the American people, positioning our economy for long-term growth, and building an America that outcompetes the rest of the world. My goal is to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not just the top down. And that's what we're on our way of doing.</p>, <p>Look, I want to thank Speaker Pelosi, who was masterful in her leadership on this, and Leader Hoyer and Whip Clyburn and Chairman DeFazio—the entire House leadership team—for the hard work, dedication, and determination to bring people together so we can make a difference in people's lives.</p>, <p>I also want to thank every Democrat in the House who worked so hard over the past few weeks to reach an agreement and who supported the process for House consideration of the jobs and infrastructure plan, the Build Back Better effort.</p>, <p>There were differences, strong points of view. They're always welcome. What is important is that we came together to advance our agenda—I think everyone who did that—I think everyone. Everyone who did it was there.</p>, <p>Look, I also want to thank everyone who voted to support the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. You know, advancing—it's an act to restore and expand voting protections, to prevent voter suppression, and to secure the most sacred of American rights: the right to vote freely, the right to vote fairly, and the right to have your vote counted.</p>, <p>The House has acted. The Senate also has to join them to send this important bill to my desk. And the Senate must also move on the [For the]* People's Act, critical legislation to protect our democracy and the right to vote. We need both of those—those election bills.</p>, <p>But let me now turn to Afghanistan. I've met this morning with my counterparts in the G-7, as well as heads of the United Nations, NATO, and the European Union. I expressed my thanks for the solidarity we have seen as we've stood up an unprecedented global effort. I updated our partners on the significant progress we've made in the past 10 days.</p>, <p>As of this afternoon, we've helped evacuate 70,700 people, just since August the 14th; 75,900 people since the end of July. Just in the past 12 hours, another 19 U.S. military flights, 18 C-17s, and one C-130 carrying approximately 6,400 evacuees and 31 coalition flights carrying 5,600 people have left Kabul, just in the last 12 hours. A total of 50 more flights, 12,000 more people since we updated you this morning.</p>, <p>These numbers are a testament to the efforts of our brave service women and men, to our diplomats on the ground in Kabul, and to our allies still standing with us.</p>, <p>And we had a productive discussion, and there was strong agreement among the leaders about—both about the evacuation mission underway, as well as the need to coordinate our approach to the Afghan—to Afghanistan as we move forward.</p>, <p>First, on evacuation, we agreed that we will continue to close—our close cooperation to get people out as efficiently and safely as possible. We are currently on a pace to finish by August the 31st. The sooner we can finish, the better. Each day of operations brings added risk to our troops.</p>, <p>But the completion by August 31 depends upon the Taliban continuing to cooperate and allow access to the airport for those who were—we're transporting out and no disruptions to our operations. In addition, I've asked the Pentagon and the State Department for contingency plans to adjust the timetable should that become necessary.</p>, <p>I'm determined to ensure that we complete our mission—this mission. I'm also mindful of the increasing risks that I've been briefed on and the need to factor those risks in.</p>, <p>There are real and significant challenges that we also have to take into consideration. The longer we stay, starting with the acute and growing risk of an attack by a terrorist group known as ISIS-K, an ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan—which is the sworn enemy of the Taliban as well—every day we're on the ground is another day we know that ISIS-K is seeking to target the airport and attack both U.S. and allied forces and innocent civilians.</p>, <p>Additionally, thus far, the Taliban have been taking steps to work with us so we can get our people out, but it's a tenuous situation. We're already—had some gun fighting break out. We run a serious risk of it breaking down as time goes on.</p>, <p>Second, the G-7 leaders, and the leaders of the EU, NATO, and the U.N., all agreed that we will stand united in our approach to the Taliban. We agreed the legitimacy of any future government depends on the approach it now takes to uphold their international obligations, including to prevent Afghanistan from being used as a base for terrorism.</p>, <p>And we agreed that none of us are going to take the Taliban's word for it. We will judge them by their actions. And we will stay in close coordination on any steps that we take moving forward in response to the Taliban's behavior.</p>, <p>At the same time, we renewed our humanitarian commitment to the Afghan people and supported a proposal by the Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations-led international response with unfettered humanitarian access in Afghanistan.</p>, <p>Third, we talked about our mutual obligation to support refugees and evacuees currently fleeing Afghanistan. The United States will be a leader in these efforts and will look to the international community and to our partners to do the same.</p>, <p>We're already seeing our allies' commitment. They're bringing their—they're bringing to their countries the Afghans who served alongside their forces as translators or in their embassies, just as we're bringing to the United States those Afghans who worked alongside our forces and diplomats. We're continuing that effort.</p>, <p>We're conducting thorough security screening in the intermediate stops they're making for anyone who is not a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident of the United States. Anyone arriving in the United States will have undergone a background check.</p>, <p>And we must all work together to resettle thousands of Afghans who ultimately qualify for refugee status. The United States will do our part. And we are already working closely with refugee organizations to rebuild a system that was purposefully destroyed by my predecessor.</p>, <p>Finally, we agreed to stay vigilant against terrorist threats that have metastasized around the world.</p>, <p>We went to Afghanistan with our allies in 2001 for clear reasons: One, to get the people who attacked us on 9/11 and to get Usama bin Laden and to make sure that Afghanistan was not used again as a base from which to attack the United States or our allies. We achieved that objective. We delivered justice to bin Laden more than a decade ago.</p>, <p>But the current environment looks very different than it did in 2001, and we have to meet the challenges we face today. We run effective counterterrorism operations around the world where we know terrorism is more of a threat than it is today in Afghanistan, without any permanent military presence on the ground. And we can and will do the same thing in Afghanistan with our over-the-horizon counterterrorism capability. Cooperation with our closest partners on our enduring counterterrorism mission will continue to be an essential piece of our strategy.</p>, <p>In short, we all—all of us agreed today that we're going to stand shoulder to shoulder with our closest partners to meet the current challenges we face in Afghanistan, just as we have for the past 20 years. We're acting in consultation and cooperation with our closest friends and fellow democracies.</p>, <p>And I want to again thank all of our allies and partners around the world who have rallied in support of our shared mission. We ended the conversation today by a clear—a statement on all of our parts. We are going to stay united, locked at the hip, in terms of what we have to do. We'll get that done.</p>, <p>And tomorrow I've asked Secretary Blinken to give you an update and a detailed report on exactly how many Americans are still in Afghanistan and how many we got out and what our projection is.</p>, <p>So thank you again. And God bless you, and may God protect our diplomats and all those in harm's way.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, can you guarantee every American will be out before the troops leave? Can you guarantee?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Sanctions? Sanctions, Mr. President? Did sanctions come up at all in the G-7 meeting?</p>]"
12,0,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Honoring the Women's National Basketball Association Champion Seattle Storm,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-honoring-the-womens-national-basketball-association-champion-seattle-storm,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Please, please, be seated. Thank you. Well, I'll tell you what, the last time I was in a room with this many great athletes, I was having dinner with my granddaughters. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Look, I tell you what, it's an honor to have you here. I mean, it really is a genuine honor to have you all here. You have no idea. I don't know how these guys got in this damn picture, but—[<i>laughter</i>]—it's okay. They're all right.</p>, <p>And look, I'm honored to welcome to the White House the 2020 WNBA Champions, the Seattle Storm. You're an inspiring team, and you represent a hell of a city, a great American city, and a groundbreaking league. The only all-female ownership group in pro sports—Lisa, Ginny, and Dawn: Congratulations. Congratulations.</p>, <p>I may need work after this. I'd be a good ball boy. I can—[<i>laughter</i>]—I can—[<i>inaudible</i>].</p>, <p>Commissioner Cathy, it's great to have you here. Thank you for your leadership of the WNBA, and now celebrating 25 years of excellence.</p>, <p>And to the players, congratulations and thank you for being you. And thank you for believing in one another.</p>, <p>You know, the Bidens are a sports family. We're one of—I have—one of our granddaughters, Maisy, is a great athlete, loves to play basketball, but also is all—first team all-state in two different sports and is now at Penn playing soccer. I have—and I have a granddaughter who—another granddaughter who's a hell of a ball player as well. I have a niece—my sister's daughter—who was first team all-American and all-Ivy in lacrosse. And I can go on and on.</p>, <p>We all thought we were pretty good athletes—the men in our family. I wasn't a bad ball player. I wasn't a bad football and baseball player—my brothers. But I've got to admit, all the women are better than us. [<i>Laughter</i>] All of them. You think I'm joking, I'm not. They're first rate.</p>, <p>And our White House is full of athletes, including some of my top aides. Annie Tomasini played point guard at Boston University. Annie—where are you, Annie? I'm going to embarrass you. Stand up, Annie.</p>, <p>I'm going to divert here in just a second. Another guy, who's a great guy that was working with me when I was trying to get the nomination a hundred years ago when we were in Iowa—which was an adventure—[<i>laughter</i>]—and we were going from one county to the next. And this guy is 6'5''. I don't want to give you his name. He's a hell of an athlete. He's six-foot-five.</p>, <p>And he was the driver, and Annie was in the back making sure we knew where we were going. And we showed up to this—this high school where we were going to speak, but it turned out we were—we didn't want to ruin our reputation. We were early. And we—that ruins my reputation, because I'm usually always late.</p>, <p>And we pulled up, and we pulled into the school parking lot. And there was a basketball, underneath one of the baskets, sitting there. And we were the only one in the park—we were—it turned out we got the time wrong. We were about an hour early.</p>, <p>So I turn to this guy Mark, and I said, ""Mark, see that ball in""—and I said—I said, ""I bet you 20 bucks Annie can beat you in high heels."" [<i>Laughter</i>] And she said, ""Oh, give me a break."" I mean, I said: ""No, come on. Let's go to 10. You know, winner keeps the ball, and you keep going."" Annie is out—goes out in high heels and blew him away 10 to 3. [<i>Laughter</i>] And he wasn't a bad athlete. But anyway—anyway, Annie is good at everything she does. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And Susan Rice—Ambassador Rice, she played high school basketball, and her niece is the top of the high school players—one of the top high school players in the country and may just be in the W one day. Where—where are you, Susan—Ambassador Rice? Her expertise is foreign policy, so I asked her to take over domestic policy for me. But anyway, Susan—[<i>laughter</i>]—I'm anxious to meet your niece.</p>, <p>This is a big day for so many of us, including for two great members of Congress here today: Represent-—Representative Rick Larsen from the State of Washington's Second District. Where are you, Rick? There you are, Rick. Come on, stand up. Let me see you, Rick. And Representative Kim Schrier. Kim, thank you. And welcome, Kim. She represents Washington's Eighth District. And it's her 35th birthday today. Happy birthday.</p>, <p>And this organization is no stranger to success: four WNBA championships, tied for the most of any franchise; and five players are Olympians—two from Australia and three from the United States. You know, Breanna Stewart, Sue Bird, Jewell Loyd: Thank you for bringing the gold home. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</p>, <p>My wife Jill led our delegation to Tokyo, and it was one of the great honors of her life. And what you accomplished there was incredible, winning the seventh straight basketball gold for Team U.S.A. Let's give a round for them.</p>, <p>Jewell's first gold, Breanna's second, and Sue's fifth. But who's counting? [<i>Laughter</i>] Who's counting? The record for any basketball player that played—man or women—that she shares with Diana. And I just think it's incredible.</p>, <p>Back in March, we had the honor of welcoming Sue's fiancée and—fiancée, Megan—excuse me, Megan came, and we tried to get her outside playing soccer with us, but it didn't work quite well, but—[<i>laughter</i>]—because we couldn't keep up. And they came to the White House to mark Equal Pay Day. And it's long past due for Equal Pay Day for women in America. Between the two of them, they share Olympic medals, World Cup titles, the WNBA Championship, and above all, they define integrity and character.</p>, <p>As President, as an American, I'm proud of how they've represented us. And they represent the best of what America stands for, as does this whole team.</p>, <p>In the WNBA, amidst a year unlike any other, this team met the moment, sweeping through the playoffs and finals against Minnesota and Las Vegas, and six wins and no losses. Masterful defense, shooting, and teamwork. Breanna earning the Finals MVP that was joined by her Olympic MVP award.</p>, <p>And by the way, Breanna is from Syracuse, New York. I went to Syracuse. [<i>Laughter</i>] How come you didn't? You went to Connecticut. [<i>Laughter</i>] I remember. I remember.</p>, <p><i>Forward</i> <i>Breanna Stewart.</i> I'm sorry.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I just want you to know—just remember—what high school did you go to in Syracuse?</p>, <p><i>Ms. Stewart.</i> Cicero-North Syracuse.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, I—you know, it was a great disappointment. [<i>Laughter</i>] But you know it's true. I'm not joking. [<i>Laughter</i>] You know it's true. Everybody knew how incredible she was when she was in high school.</p>, <p>But what's even more special is, she and her wife just became moms for their new baby, Ruby. Congratulations. A WBA—a WNBA championship, Olympic gold, and a precious Ruby. And what a year, Breanna. It's a—I—it's a hell of year you've had, kid.</p>, <p>And what makes this team remarkable is, they don't just win games, they change lives: encouraging people to get vaccinated so we can beat this pandemic; speaking out and standing up for racial justice and voting rights; supporting education and membership programs for young people and—excuse me, mentorship programs for young people; and fighting to protect trans youth from an epidemic of violence and discrimination.</p>, <p>That's what winners do. They shine the light. They lift people up. They're a force for change. That's the Seattle Storm. That's the WNBA. That's what they do. For 25 years, the WNBA has been changing what's possible for millions of women and girls all across the world. You give people—you give them courage.</p>, <p>You know, I can say as much as I want—from the time my two daughters were born—that you can do anything a man can do. It's one thing for somebody to say that and keep pounding that in the head of your five granddaughters as well. But guess what? Until they see it, until they watch, it becomes real then.</p>, <p>That's why, by the way, she's—and happens to be in Asia for me right now—but that's why we have a female Vice President of United States of America who's going to be—we're going to have some Presidents pretty soon.</p>, <p>And redefining what sports can mean in the life of a community and the never-ending work of building a more just, a more equal, and a more perfect Union. That's why, as a nation, we need to support women's sports, not just during the Olympics, but during the year—during every season—by showing up in person and watching on TV, with more sponsorships and programming to help grow the business of women's sports.</p>, <p>And these women are amazing athletes. They're the best in the world. And we honor them by showing up for them. To the whole Storm family, thank you all and congratulations. And best of luck for this—the rest of the season.</p>, <p>Now, I want to ask Storm co-owner Ginny Gilder to come up and say a few words, if you will, Ginny.</p>, <p><i>Co-owner Ginny Gilder.</i> Ah, I get to take this off.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I forgot my mask. I'm going to get in trouble.</p>, <p><i>Ms. Gilder.</i> Oh, especially if you come near me.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> What did I do with my mask? There you go.</p>, <p><i>Ms. Gilder.</i> You good? [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Every championship pro sports team in reaching the pinnacle of athletic excellence is extraordinary. That's certainly the case with the 2020 WNBA champions, who pretty much ran away with the trophy. The women before you swept through the playoffs and won the last game of the finals by over 30 points.</p>, <p>[<i>Ms. Gilder continued her remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>In Seattle, inspired and informed by our players, our franchise formalized its own history of advocacy by creating a social justice platform, Force4Change. Today, Crystal Langhorne, one of our two-time WNBA champions and now retired, leads that effort as a member of our executive team. I've asked her to come up and give you just a taste of the work that she's leading.</p>, <p>Thank you, President Biden, for recognizing these women, for helping lead the way to a more equitable and just tomorrow.</p>, <p><i>Force4Change Director of Community Engagement Crystal Langhorne.</i> Mask off. Good afternoon, everyone.</p>, <p>We are truly honored to be here for our achievements on the court, but I think I can speak for all of us from the Storm organization: We are extremely proud of who we are off the court. Force4Change focuses on creating a more equitable society: on amplifying Black women, BIPOC youth, and the LGBTQ+ community. But it's not just about amplifying; it's about investing into communities that have been underserved and working with the organizations that have been leading the way in this space.</p>, <p>This summer, we worked with our community partners and together invested $100,000 in the Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle, matching what we invested to the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund last year. Social justice cannot fade into the background. We have to continue to amplify, invest, and do whatever we can to be a force for change.</p>, <p>Being the first women's team to visit this administration—an administration that aligns with so many of our values—is such an honor. So thank you. And now I'm proud to turn this over to my former teammates—our three Olympic gold medalists—Sue Bird, Jewell Loyd, and Breanna Stewart, who will present President Biden with his jersey.</p>, <p><i>Guard Sue Bird.</i> First of all, thank—I want to thank everybody here who helped put this together and bring us to the White House. It's special to be here.</p>, <p>[<i>Ms. Bird continued her remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>So thank you to you, President Biden, and your administration for all the work you're continuing to do. To the team: I mean, I rock with you guys so hard. The 2020 season was amazing, and it's just beyond to be here right now.</p>, <p>So it's my honor and privilege to present you——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Ms. Bird.</i> Do you want—Stewie to present you this jersey? And we thank you so much for having us here. It's such an honor.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you.</p>]"
12,1,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-covid-19-response-and-national-vaccination-efforts,"[<p>Good afternoon.</p>, <p>Today we've hit another milestone—a key milestone—in our Nation's fight against COVID. The Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, announced that it's fully concluded its—its now—its thorough and independent scientific review. After a strict process, the FDA has reaffirmed its findings that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective, and the FDA has given its full and final approval.</p>, <p>So let me say this loudly and clearly: If you have—if you're one of the millions of Americans who said that they will not get the shot when it's—until it has full and final approval of the FDA, it has now happened. The moment you've been waiting for is here, and it's time for you to go get your vaccination and get it today. Today. It's an important moment in our fight against the pandemic.</p>, <p>You know, I want to thank the Acting Commissioner, Janet Woodcock, and the entire team at the FDA for their hard work. Dr. Woodcock is a true professional. She's a career scientist who served under Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents. She's ensured that the team followed the science above all.</p>, <p>They've looked at the mountains of clinical data—clinical trial data and the safety and efficiency [efficacy]* data and concluded, without question, the vaccine was safe and effective for emergency use in December. That same thing—we've got those shots in arms at the time: 350 million in the United States and billions across the world. They kept pouring over this data. The FDA approval is the gold standard.</p>, <p>And as I just said, now it has been granted. Those who have been waiting for full approval should go get your shot now. Vaccination is free. It's easy, it's safe, and it's effective. And it's convenient. For 90 percent of Americans, there's a vaccination site less than 5 miles from your home, and you can get the shot without an appointment. So please, get your shot today. There is no time to waste.</p>, <p>The Delta variant is dangerous and spreading, causing a pandemic of the unvaccinated. That's the pandemic of the vaccinated. And while we're starting to see initial signs that cases may be declining in a few places, nationwide, cases are still rising, especially among the unvaccinated.</p>, <p>Across the country, virtually all of the COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths continue to be among the unvaccinated. That's worse in States where vaccination rates are overall low. But even in States where many people are vaccinated, the unvaccinated are still at risk.</p>, <p>Let me be clear: There are cases where vaccinated people do get COVID-19, but they are far less common than unvaccinated people getting COVID-19. And most importantly, their conditions are far less severe. The overwhelming majority of people in the hospital who have COVID-19 are—almost all of those dying from COVID-19 are not vaccinated. Not vaccinated. If you're fully vaccinated—both shots, plus 2 weeks—your risk of severe illness from COVID-19 is very, very, very low.</p>, <p>Now, I know that parents are concerned about COVID-19 cases among their children. I'll be addressing this soon with Secretary Cardona to discuss how to get our kids back to school safely. Cases among children are still rare, and severe cases among children are very, very rare. But I know that parents are thinking about their own kids, and it's not as reassuring as anyone would like it to be.</p>, <p>So let me say this as parents—to the parents: As you have—you have the tools. You have the tools to keep your child safer, and two of those tools, above all, are available to you. One, make sure that everyone around your child, who can be vaccinated, is vaccinated: parents, adults, teens. Two, make sure your child is masked when they leave home. That's how we can best keep our kids safe.</p>, <p>As I've said before, the pandemic of the unvaccinated is a tragedy that is preventable. People are dying, and will die, who don't have to. So please, please, if you haven't gotten your vaccination—if you haven't gotten vaccinated, do it now. It could save your life and the lives of those you love.</p>, <p>Now, the good news is that people are getting vaccinated. For the past several weeks, my administration has imposed new vaccine requirements on Federal workers, the Armed Forces, people who work in Federal medical facilities, and nursing home workers. Governors, mayors, and private sector leaders have done the same.</p>, <p>We've also encouraged new incentives. For example, in some States, you get $100 if you get vaccinated. These new requirements and incentives are accelerating vaccinations once again, giving us the hope that we can put this Delta variant behind us in the weeks ahead.</p>, <p>There are three facts everyone should know about where we are in this fight against this pandemic. First, even as the Delta variant has ravaged the unvaccinated, the deaths have climbed—and deaths have climbed, the death rate is still 70-percent lower than what it was last winter. Why? Because we did such a good job vaccinating those most at risk: senior citizens. America has about 54 million senior citizens. About 50 million have at least have gotten at least one shot. That's almost 92 percent.</p>, <p>Secondly, overall, weekly new vaccinations are up more than 56 percent from where they were a month ago. Last week, we saw a record of vaccinations, more than 1 million shots a day for 3 straight days. This is the first time this has happened since June. Six million shots in the last 7 days, the highest 7-day total in over a month and a half</p>, <p>Remember—remember when we were trying to get 70 percent of the people over 18 at least one shot? Well, we've not only gotten that done; we've gotten 71 percent of everyone age 12 and older their first shot. That's over 200 million Americans. And over 170 million are now fully vaccinated.</p>, <p>Third, States that had been lagging are seeing their vaccination rates grow faster. In fact, in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, more people got new vaccinations in the past month than in the prior 2 months combined. The progress we're making on vaccinations now is going to produce results in the weeks ahead. The sooner you get fully vaccinated, the sooner you'll be protected.</p>, <p>According to the experts from the Yale School of Public Health, the pace of our vaccination effort has saved over 100,000 lives and have prevented more than 450,000 hospitalizations. This is critical progress, but we need to move faster.</p>, <p>As I mentioned before, I've imposed vaccination requirements that will reach millions of Americans. Today I'm calling on more countries—more companies, I should say, in the private sector to step up with vaccine requirements that will reach millions more people. If you're a business leader, a nonprofit leader, a State or local leader who has been waiting for full FDA approval to require vaccinations, I call on you now to do that—require it. Do what I did last month and require your employees to get vaccinated or face strict requirements.</p>, <p>And as I said last week, vaccination requirements have been around for decades. Students, health care professionals, our troops are typically required to receive vaccination to prevent everything from polio to smallpox, measles, mumps, rubella.</p>, <p>In fact, the reason most people in America don't worry about polio, smallpox, measles, mumps, and rubella today is because of vaccines. It only makes sense to require a vaccine to stop the spread of COVID-19.</p>, <p>With today's FDA full approval, there's another good reason to get vaccinated. So please get vaccinated now. If you go to vaccines.com [vaccines.gov]*—vaccines.com [vaccines.gov]*—or text your ZIP Code to 438829—438829—you can find a number of vaccine sites near you, just minutes away, where you can get your shot without an appointment.</p>, <p>All around the world, people want these vaccines. Here in America, they're free, convenient, and waiting for you. So please go today—for yourself, for your loved ones, for your neighbors, for your country.</p>, <p>I'll close with this: We're in the midst of a wartime effort to beat this pandemic. It's one of the biggest and most complicated challenges in our history. And it's based on an unparalleled vaccination program that is saving lives and beating this virus. It's a vaccination program that's getting us back to our loved ones and a way of life we were used to. It's happening, and it's going to keep happening if you help—it helps our economy. It gets everything moving. It keeps us growing.</p>, <p>Together, we've made significant progress in just 7 months. We just have to finish the job with science, facts, and confidence, together—together—as the United States of America. So, please get vaccinated today.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.</p>]"
12,2,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks on the Flooding in Tennessee, Tropical Storm Henri, and United States Evacuation Efforts in Afghanistan and an Exchange With Reporters",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-flooding-tennessee-tropical-storm-henri-and-united-states-evacuation-efforts,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good afternoon. After a series of meetings throughout the weekend with my national security team, I want to update the American people on our ongoing evacuation operation in Afghanistan.</p>, <p>But first, I just was briefed by the FEMA Administrator, who is here with me today—Ms. Criswell—about the flash flooding in Waverly, Tennessee, and surrounding areas in Tennessee. I want to begin by expressing my deepest condolences for the sudden and tragic loss of life due to this flash flood. I know we've reached out to the community, and we stand ready to offer them support. I've asked the Administrator to speak to Governor Lee of Tennessee right away, and we'll offer any assistance they need for this terrible moment.</p>, <p>Let me also say a few words about what is now Tropical Storm—not hurricane—Henri, which made landfall at approximately 12:15 this afternoon in Rhode Island. Henri is impacting much of the Northeast right now, and I want to talk about our efforts to prepare and respond to this storm. We have been closely monitoring Henri's progress and making the necessary preparations. Fortunately, it's no longer a hurricane; it's been downgraded to a tropical storm. And we are taking it seriously though, because of the size and the storm's surge and the rainfall it's producing. It's also impacting an area of the country that has already experienced heavy rainfall over the past several days.</p>, <p>And while New Englanders are used to dealing with some tough weather, this storm has the potential for widespread consequences across the region, with significant flooding and power outages that could affect hundreds of thousands of people.</p>, <p>And so we're doing everything we can now to help these States prepare, respond, and recover. I can't think of anyone better to lead this operation than Deanne Criswell of the—of FEMA. She's—before she headed up FEMA, she led the emergency response in New York City, and she was one of the key Federal officials leading our response to Superstorm Sandy. She knows this area very, very well and knows what's needed better than anyone.</p>, <p>Yesterday I talked with the Administrator and each of the Governors in the key States most likely to be affected. I urged them to take advantage of the assistance FEMA can offer in advance and committed to doing everything we can to support their communities through the storm and afterwards.</p>, <p>FEMA has already prepositioned resources in the region to speed our ability to respond, including food, water, and lifesaving communications equipment, as well as generators. In close cooperation with the electrical sector, preparations are in place to address significant power outages. And resources and support is staged at the edge of this storm to be able to move quickly in to help.</p>, <p>Thousands of additional line crews and vegetation-clearing crews from other States and from Canada are already heading toward the impacted States in New England, ready to serve as—move in as soon as it's feasible. They'll clean up fallen trees, help local utilities repair damaged lines, and restore electrical service as fast as possible. I want to thank these crews for their commitment to helping their fellow citizens in time of need.</p>, <p>I've already approved—I've already approved—emergency declarations for Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York, which activates funds and means we can get in there and help as soon as this extreme weather has moved through.</p>, <p>We don't know the full extent of the storm's impact today, but we are acting to prepare for and prevent damage as much as possible and to speed help to affected communities so they can recover as quickly as possible. I also want to encourage everyone to do their part to prepare, follow the guidance from their local authorities. Some places have already had heavy rains and winds and dangerous storm surges.</p>, <p>Henri is going to continue to move across much of the Northeast, so it is important to monitor it closely and be prepared in your home and your community. Make sure you have the supplies for your entire household, including necessary medications and food, water, battery-powered radios in case of extended power outages. And don't forget that you may need to seek shelter while you're battling the Delta variant and the COVID-19. So wear a mask, and try to observe social distancing.</p>, <p>And to everyone across the country, don't get caught by the next storm. Get vaccinated. Get vaccinated now. Protect yourself and your family against COVID-19. It's going to be a vital part of emergency preparedness this year—for the remainder of this year.</p>, <p>Now, let me turn to Afghanistan. I've continued to make progress since I spoke to you on Friday. We have moved thousands of people each day by U.S. military aircraft and civilian charter flights. A little over 30 hours—in a little over 30 hours this weekend, we've evacuated an extraordinary number of people, as I will detail in a minute: about 11,000 individuals. That number will change day to day as the air and ground operations in Kabul vary.</p>, <p>Our first priority in Kabul is getting American citizens out of the country as quickly and as safely as possible. At my direction, the State Department continues to reach out to the remaining Americans we have identified by phone, e-mail, and other means to ascertain their whereabouts and their plans.</p>, <p>We're executing a plan to move groups of these Americans to safety and to safely and effectively move them to the airport compound. For security reasons, I'm not going to go into the detail of what these plans entail, but I will say again today that I have said before: Any American who wants to get home will get home.</p>, <p>We've also been evacuating the citizens of our NATO allies and our partners, including their diplomats, their embassy staff who remain in Afghanistan, and to get them back to their homes as well. And as we do this, we're also working to move our Afghan allies, who stood with us side by side, and other vulnerable Afghans, such as women leaders and journalists, out of the country.</p>, <p>As of this morning, we have evacuated nearly 28,000 people since August the 14th, on both U.S. and coalition aircraft, including civilian charters, bringing the total number of people we have evacuated since July to approximately 33,000 persons.</p>, <p>In one 24-hour period this weekend, 23 U.S. military flights—including 14 C-17s, 9 C-130 flights—left Kabul carrying 3,900 passengers. We see no reason why this tempo will not be kept up. During the same period, our military facilitated another 35 charter flights carrying an additional nearly 4,000 evacuees to other countries that are taking them out. Altogether, we lifted approximately 11,000 people out of Kabul in less than 36 hours. It's an incredible operation.</p>, <p>Let me be clear: The evacuation of thousands of people from Kabul is going to be hard and painful no matter when it started and when we began. It would have been true if we had started a month ago or a month from now. There is no way to evacuate this many people without pain and loss, of heartbreaking images you see on television. It's just a fact. My heart aches for those people you see.</p>, <p>We are proving that we can move, though, thousands of people a day out of Kabul. We're bringing our citizens, NATO allies, Afghanis who had helped—in fact, has helped us in the war effort. But we have a long way to go, and a lot could still go wrong.</p>, <p>But to move out 30,000 people in just over a week, that's a great testament to the men and women on the ground in Kabul and our Armed Services. It also reflects a tireless diplomatic effort. In order to keep a steady flow of planes taking off from Kabul and maximize our evacuation capacity, we have quickly stood up an unprecedented global effort and established a series of processing stations in third countries.</p>, <p>In short, we're not flying them directly to their country, we're flying to these processing stations where we're working with more than two dozen countries across four continents. I've secured agreements—we've secured agreements with the Gulf—excuse me—across the Gulf, in Central Asia, and in Europe, including processing centers in Qatar, Germany, Kuwait, Spain, and elsewhere that allows us to sort and process these evacuees.</p>, <p>This transit—these transit centers provide a safe place for the SIV applicants and other vulnerable Afghanis and their families to complete their paperwork while we conduct security screenings and background checks before they continue on to their final destination in the United States or in another country, one of our NATO allies as well.</p>, <p>And so, from Asia to Africa, from Europe to Western—to the Western Hemisphere, nations are making generous offers to support resettlements efforts. And I've been in personal contact with the leaders of many countries, including Qatar, Germany, Spain, Italy, the U.A.E., and others—they're making vital contributions—to thank them for their support and to discuss how we can continue to coordinate our efforts in Afghanistan, moving forward. It's the reason why I continue in contact with them. And I want to, again, thank all of our partners for their continued—continuing to stand together.</p>, <p>We've also activated the first stage of what's referred to as the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to help with the onward movement of evacuees from these transit centers. Our military aircraft and others will get them to these centers, but then we're going to get the Civil Reserve Fleet—it's a program that's designed—that was designed in the wake of the Berlin Airlift after World War II—to use commercial aircraft to augment our airlift capacity. This is a voluntary program for our commercial airlines, and we're grateful for those airlines and the U.S. carriers who are supporting this.</p>, <p>This effort will only use three or four planes from each of the major carriers' vast fleets of aircraft, so there should be no effect, or a minimal effect, on commercial air travel. And we'll stay in close coordination with our partners to mitigate any impact.</p>, <p>These Civil Reserve flights will be helping facilitate the safe movement of people from staging locations and transit centers, like Qatar and Germany, to the United States or to a third country. None of them will be landing in Kabul. Now, the American aircraft part of this will not be going to any country but the United States.</p>, <p>As this effort unfolds, I want to be clear about three things. One, planes taking off from Kabul are not flying directly to the United States. They're landing at U.S. military bases and transit centers around the world.</p>, <p>Number two, at these sites where they're landing, we are conducting thorough scrutiny—security screenings for everyone who is not a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident. Anyone arriving in the United States will have undergone a background check.</p>, <p>Number three, once screened and cleared, we will welcome these Afghans, who helped us in the war effort over the last 20 years, to their new home in the United States of America. Because that's who we are. That's what America is.</p>, <p>You know, I've been touched by the outpouring of support that we've seen from communities and organizations across America mobilizing to support these efforts. So many of these Afghans stood bravely by U.S. troops in Afghanistan. And now the United States, including veterans groups, refugee settlement agencies, religious organizations, and so many others, are standing with our Afghan allies. It exemplifies the best of America.</p>, <p>And I want to say, again, just how difficult this mission is and how dangerous—the dangers it poses to our troops on the ground. The security environment is changing rapidly. There are civilians crowded at the airport, although we've cleared thousands of them. We know that terrorists may seek to exploit this situation and target innocent Afghans or American troops.</p>, <p>They're maintaining constant vigilance to monitor—we're maintaining the constant vigilance to monitor and disrupt threats of—from any source, including the likely source being ISIS-K, the Afghan affiliate referred to as ISIS-K. But we are under no illusions about the threat.</p>, <p>I said on Friday, ISIS-K is a sworn enemy of the Taliban, and they have a history of fighting one another. But every day we have troops on the ground, these troops and innocent civilians at the airport face the risk of attack from ISIS-K from a distance, even though we're moving back the perimeter significantly.</p>, <p>We're working hard and as fast as we can to get people out. That's our mission. That's our goal. And our determination to get every American citizen home and to evacuate our Afghan allies is unwavering.</p>, <p>We continue to see not only enormous—the enormous scope and scale of the effort, we will see the individual lives that are affected. The families that are desperate to get home to their loved ones in America. The communities of veterans who have mobilized to try and help their former interpreters get to safety. The frightened Afghans who aren't sure what to do. To state the obvious, it's heartbreaking. We're all seeing it. We see it. We feel it. You can't look at it and not feel it.</p>, <p>Nothing about this effort is easy, but the women and men of the United States Armed Forces are acting bravely and with professionalism and with a basic human compassion. I want to offer my profound thanks to our servicemembers on the ground in Kabul and to all those at U.S. bases around the world who are welcoming and caring for these evacuees.</p>, <p>And to all the diplomats and civil servants who are working around the clock to rescue American citizens, the citizens of our allies, our Afghan partners, vulnerable Afghans—such as women leaders and journalists—what we are doing is extraordinary, and you have to think of the—of all they're doing. It's thanks to the people who, from all over the world, who are helping this effort.</p>, <p>So I want to thank you, and I'll keep you informed every day as we move forward. May God protect our troops and our diplomats and—who are serving in harm's way.</p>, <p>Now I'll take a few questions.</p>, <p>Darlene [Darlene Superville] from the Associated Press.</p>, <p><i>Timeline for the Withdrawal of U.S. Troops From Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you. We're 9 days away from the August 31 deadline. Will you extend that deadline? Or what is your thought process on extending the evacuation operations?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> There's discussions going on among us and the military about extending. Our hope is we will not have to extend, but there are going to be discussions, I suspect, on how far along we are in the process.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Mario Parker, Bloomberg.</p>, <p><i>Timeline for the Withdrawal of U.S. Troops From Afghanistan/Group of Seven (G-7) Nations/U.S. Evacuation Efforts in Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you, Mr. President. Just to piggyback off the August 31 deadline, you told the G-7 in Cornwall, you promised them support, back in June. If they ask for a larger or a longer American presence past the August 31 deadline, what will you tell them on Tuesday, sir?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I will tell them that we'll see what we can do. Look, we are working closely with the G-7. I've spoken with most of the leaders of G-7. I'll be doing a conference with them, I think, Tuesday—I'm not certain—and we'll have that discussion.</p>, <p>But we are—we already have helped get out diplomats from other countries. We've already helped get out citizens from other countries, and we'll continue to do that.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>And, Mr. President, it sounded like that the—you've extended operations into Kabul, outside of the airport. Is that correct?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> What I'm not going to do is talk about the tactical changes we're making to make sure we maintain as much security as we can.</p>, <p>We have constantly—how can I say it?—increased rational access to the airport, where more folk can get there more safely. It's still a dangerous operation.</p>, <p>But I don't want to go into the detail of how we're doing that.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>Andrew [Andrew Restuccia] from the Wall Street Journal.</p>, <p><i>U.S. Evacuation Efforts in Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thanks, Mr. President. Our reporting on the ground shows that Afghans with the proper paperwork are still having trouble getting to the airport. Some say they feel abandoned by the U.S. U.S. Embassy staff still haven't—some U.S. Embassy staff that are Afghan haven't been able to make it into the airport as well. Why isn't the U.S. doing more to allow Afghans into the airport—to ensure access to the airport? And are you still opposed to setting up an extended perimeter around the airport to help ease that access?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Number one, I think you're going to see they're going to get out. Number two, we have made a number of changes, including extending the access around the airport and the safe zone. And we've done a number of things, again, I don't want to get into detail about.</p>, <p>But the fact is that more and more of the groups we urgently want to get out of Afghanistan, starting with American citizens and the folks who worked in the embassies and personnel with our allies, as well as the Afghans who helped them and worked in those embassies, as well as those who helped them on the battlefield as well—we are working diligently to make sure we've increased the ability to get them out. We've changed the gate operations and a whole range of things. And that's why we've been able to significantly increase the number of people we're getting out.</p>, <p><i>Taliban/Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>And will the Taliban agree to an extension past August 31? Have you discussed that with them?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> We've discussed a lot with the Taliban. They've been cooperative in extending some of the perimeter. That remains to be seen whether we ask that question.</p>, <p>Ed [Ed O'Keefe, CBS News], fire away.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thanks, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I don't want you jumping over that—[<i>inaudible</i>].</p>, <p><i>Withdrawal of U.S. Troops From Afghanistan/U.S. Counterterrorism Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Just following up on Andrew's question. Because the United States is now negotiating with the Taliban over airport access and such, do you now trust them?</p>, <p>And then a question on the public response. A new poll, out today shows Americans wanted to withdraw from Afghanistan, but they disapprove of the way you've handled it. The poll also found that based in part of what transpired over the last week, a majority of Americans—and forgive me, I'm just the messenger—no longer consider you to be competent, focused, or effective at the job.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I haven't seen that poll.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>It's out there, from CBS this morning. [<i>Laughter</i>]<i> </i>What would you say to those Americans who no longer believe that you can do the job?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Look, I had a basic decision to make: I either withdraw America from a 20-year war that, depending on whose analysis you accept, cost us $150 million a day for 20 years or $300 million a day for 20 years; who—and I—you know I carry this card with me every day—and who—in fact, where we lost 2,448 Americans dead and 20,722 wounded. Either increase the number of forces we'd keep—we keep there and keep that going or I end the war. And I decided to end the war.</p>, <p>As I said the other day: You know, the only reason we were in Afghanistan is, this is the place from which bin Laden attacked the United States of America. Had this been in another Middle Eastern country where he could have easily had moved from, we would have never gone to Afghanistan. So the question is, when is the right time to leave? Where are our national interests? Where do they lie?</p>, <p>And the idea that we are in a situation where we cannot recognize that terrorism has metastasized around the world and the need for us to focus in other parts of the world which create an even greater danger of an Al Qaida-like operation beginning, it can't be ignored. And we are, as you well know—because you follow this—we are in a number of places where we're doing that without permanent basing of American forces there.</p>, <p>So I think when this is over, the American people will have a clear understanding of what I did, why we did it. And—but look, that's the job. My job is to make judgments. My job is to make judgments no one else can or will make. I made them. I'm convinced I'm absolutely correct in not deciding to send more young women and men to war, for a war that, in fact, is no longer warranted.</p>, <p><i>Taliban/Withdrawal of U.S. Troops From Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>On the question of the Taliban though, do you—are they—do you trust them now? Do you have deal with them?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I don't trust anybody, including you. I love you, but you know—[<i>laughter</i>]—there's not a lot of people I trust to—look, the Taliban has a—the Taliban has to make a fundamental decision: Is the Taliban going to attempt to be able to unite and provide for the well-being of the people of Afghanistan, which no one group has ever done since before dealing—for hundreds of years. And if it does, it's going to need everything from additional help, in terms of economic assistance, trades, and a whole range of things.</p>, <p>The Taliban has said—we'll see whether they mean it or not—they're seeking legitimacy. They're seeking legitimacy to determine whether or not they will be recognized by other countries. They have told other countries, as well as us, they don't want us to move our diplomatic presence completely. But they—so, all of this is all just talk now. All just talk now.</p>, <p>And so, so far, the Taliban has not taken action against U.S. forces. So far, they have, by and large, followed through what they said, in terms of allowing Americans to pass through and the like. And I'm sure they don't control all of their forces. It's a ragtag force. And so we'll see. We'll see whether or not what they say turns out to be true.</p>, <p>But the bottom line is this, folks: Look, at the end of the day, if we didn't leave Afghanistan now, when do we leave? Another 10 years? Another 5 years? Another year? I'm not about to send your son or your daughter to fight in Afghanistan. I don't see where that is in our overwhelming interest.</p>, <p>And the talk about how our interests are going to be impacted: Let me tell you, you're sitting in Beijing, or you're sitting in Moscow—are you happy we left? [<i>Laughter</i>] They'd love nothing better for us to continue to be bogged down there, totally occupied with what's going on.</p>, <p>So the idea, this is—I think that history is going to record this was the logical, rational, and right decision to make.</p>, <p>So thank you all so very much. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Taliban </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Do you support the sanctions against the Taliban? The British are calling for sanctions. They're going to discuss sanctions on Tuesday. Would you support sanctions against the Taliban under certain conditions? On Friday, you mentioned ""harsh conditions"" if they misbehaved.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> The answer is ""yes."" It depends on the conduct.</p>, <p>Thanks.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, what about the ISIS and the threats that Americans face now?</p>]"
12,3,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on United States Evacuation Efforts in Afghanistan and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-united-states-evacuation-efforts-afghanistan-and-exchange-with-reporters,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good afternoon. I've just met with the Vice President, Secretary Blinken, Secretary Austin, National Security Adviser Sullivan, and other members the national security leadership team in the Situation Room to discuss our ongoing efforts to evacuate American citizens, third-country civilians, Afghan allies, and vulnerable Afghans. And I want to provide the American people with a brief update and the—on the situation in Afghanistan.</p>, <p>Since I spoke to you on Monday, we've made significant progress. We have secured the airport, enabling flights to resume. Not just military flights, but civilian charters and other—from other countries and the NGOs taking out civilians and vulnerable Afghanis.</p>, <p>And now we have almost 6,000 troops on the ground, including the 82d Airborne providing runway security, the Army 10th Mountain Division standing guard around the airport, and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit assisting the civilian departure.</p>, <p>This is one of the largest, most difficult airlifts in history. And the only country in the world capable of projecting this much power on the far side of the world with this degree of precision is the United States of America.</p>, <p>We've already evacuated more than 18,000 people since July and approximately 13,000 since our military airlift began on August the 14th. Thousands more have been evacuated on private charter flights facilitated by the U.S. Government.</p>, <p>These numbers include American citizens and permanent residents, as well as their families. It includes SIV applicants and their families—those Afghans who have worked alongside us, served alongside of us, gone into combat with us, and provided invaluable assistance to us, such as translators and interpreters.</p>, <p>The United States stands by its commitment that we've made to these people, and it includes other vulnerable Afghans, such as women leaders and journalists. In fact, working in close coordination with the management of the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal, we have successfully evacuated all 204 of their employees in Afghanistan on U.S. military aircraft earlier this week.</p>, <p>We have established the flow of flights, and we've increased the number of people we are moving out of the country. We paused flights in Kabul a few hours this morning to make sure we could process the arriving evacuees at the transit points, but our commander in Kabul has already given the order for outbound flights to resume.</p>, <p>Even with the pause, we moved out 5,700 evacuees yesterday, and we're working on a variety—to verify that number of the Americans that are still in the country as we work on this because we're not—don't have the exact number of people who are—Americans who are there. And those who may have come home to the United States, we're not—we want to get a strong number as to exactly how many people are there, how many American citizens, and where they are. Just yesterday, among the many Americans we evacuated, there were 169 Americans who, over the—we got over the wall into the airport using military assets.</p>, <p>We're also facilitating flights for our allies and our partners and working in close operational coordination with NATO on this evacuation. For example, we provided overwatch for the French convoy bringing hundreds of their people from the French Embassy to the airport.</p>, <p>These operations are going to continue over the coming days before we complete our drawdown. We're going to do everything—everything—that we can to provide safe evacuation for our Afghan allies, partners, and Afghans who might be targeted if—because of their association with the United States.</p>, <p>But let me be clear, any American who wants to come home, we will get you home.</p>, <p>But make no mistake: This evacuation mission is dangerous. It involves risks to our Armed Forces, and it is being conducted under difficult circumstances.</p>, <p>I cannot promise what the final outcome will be or what it will be—that it will be without risk of loss. But as Commander in Chief, I can assure you that I will mobilize every resource necessary. And as an American, I offer my gratitude to the brave men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces who are carrying out this mission. They're incredible.</p>, <p>And as we continue to work the logistics of evacuation, we're in constant contact with the Taliban, working to ensure civilians have safe passage to the airport. We are particularly focused on our engagements on making sure every American who wants to leave can get to the airport. Where we have been—seen challenges with Americans—for Americans, we have thus far been able to resolve them.</p>, <p>We've been able—we've made—look, we've made clear to the Taliban that any attack—any attack on our forces or disruption of our operations at the airport will be met with swift and forceful response.</p>, <p>We're also keeping a close watch on any potential terrorist threat at or around the airport, including from the ISIS affiliates in Afghanistan who were released from prison when the prisons were emptied. And because they are, by the way—to make everybody understand—that the ISIS in Afghanistan are the—have been the sworn enemy of the Taliban.</p>, <p>I've said all along: We're going to retain a laser focus on our counterterrorism mission, working in close coordination with our allies and our partners and all those who have an interest in ensuring stability in the region.</p>, <p>Secretary Blinken, who is with me today, met this morning with our NATO allies in consultation about the way forward so that Afghanistan cannot be used as a—in the future as a terrorist base of attack—to attack the United States or our allies.</p>, <p>For 20 years, Afghanistan has been a joint effort with our NATO allies. We went in together, and we're leaving together, and now we're working together to bring our people and our Afghan partners to safety.</p>, <p>In the past few days, I've also spoken directly with the British Prime Minster, Mr. Johnson; Chancellor Merkel of Germany; and President Macron of France. We all agreed that we should convene and we will convene the G-7 meeting next week—a group of the world's leading democracies—so that together we can coordinate our mutual approach, our united approach on Afghanistan and moving forward. We are united with our closest partners to execute the mission at hand.</p>, <p>We've also discussed the need to work with the international community to provide humanitarian assistance, such as food, aid, and medical care for refugees who have crossed into neighboring countries to escape the Taliban; and to bring international pressure on the Taliban with respect to the treatment of Afghan—the Afghan people overall, but including Afghan, particularly, women and girls.</p>, <p>The past week has been heartbreaking. We've seen gut-wrenching images of panicked people acting out of sheer desperation. You know, it's completely understandable. They're frightened, they're sad, uncertain what happens next. I don't think anyone—I don't think any one of us—can see those pictures and not feel that pain on a human level.</p>, <p>Now we have a mission, a mission to complete in Afghanistan. It's an incredibly difficult and dangerous operation for our military. We have almost 6,000 of America's finest fighting men and women in—at the Kabul Airport. And we're putting their lives on the line—they're doing it—in a dangerous place to save other Americans, our Afghan allies, and citizens of our allies who went in with us.</p>, <p>You know, I talk to our commanders on the ground there every single day, as I just did a few hours—an hour or so ago. And I made it clear to them that we'll get them whatever they need to do the job. They're performing to the highest standard under extraordinarily difficult and dynamic circumstances. Our NATO allies are strongly standing with us, their troops keeping sentry alongside ours in Kabul.</p>, <p>As is the case whenever I deploy our troops into harm's way, I take that responsibility seriously. I carry that burden every day, just as I did when I was Vice President and my son was deployed to Iraq for a year.</p>, <p>There'll be plenty of time to criticize and second-guess when this operation is over. But now—now—I'm focused on getting this job done. I would ask every American to join me in praying for the women and men risking their lives on the ground in the service of our Nation.</p>, <p>As events evolve over the coming days, my team and I will continue to share the information and update the American people on exactly where things are. We'll use every resource necessary to carry out the mission at hand and bring to safety American citizens and our Afghan allies. This is our focus now.</p>, <p>And when this is finished, we will complete our military withdrawal and finally bring to an end 20 years of American military action in Afghanistan.</p>, <p>Thank you, and may God bless you, our troops, our diplomats, and all those serving in harm's way.</p>, <p>And now I'll take questions.</p>, <p>AP, Zeke Miller.</p>, <p><i>Withdrawal of U.S. Military Forces From Afghanistan/U.S. Counterterrorism Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you, Mr. President. You vowed that your election would usher in an era where the world could count on America to live up to its promises. You promised to leave Afghanistan, but you also promised not to—to help—to bring out those who helped America in its war effort. We've seen these heart-wrenching images at the Kabul airport of people trying to get there, to say nothing of the people who can't get to that airport.</p>, <p>You made the commitment to get American troops out, to get the American citizens out. Will you make the same commitment to those who assisted in the American war effort over the last 20 years? Number one.</p>, <p>And then, number two: What's your message to America's partners around the world who have criticized not the withdrawal, but the conduct of that withdrawal, and made it—made them question America's credibility on the world stage?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I have seen no question of our credibility from our allies around the world. I have spoken with our NATO allies. We've spoken with NATO allies—the Secretary of State. Our National Security Adviser has been in contact with his counterparts throughout the world with our allies, as has the general—or, excuse me, I keep calling him a general, but my Secretary of Defense.</p>, <p>The fact of the matter is, I have not seen that. Matter of fact, the exact opposite I've got—the exact opposite thing is, we're acting with dispatch, we're acting—committing to what we said we would do.</p>, <p>Look, let's put this thing in perspective here. What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point with Al Qaida gone? We went to Afghanistan for the express purpose of getting rid of Al Qaida in Afghanistan, as well as—as well as—getting Usama bin Laden. And we did.</p>, <p>Imagine—just imagine if that attack—if bin Laden had decided, with Al Qaida, to launch an attack from Yemen. Would we ever have gone to Afghanistan? Would there ever be any reason we'd be in Afghanistan, controlled by the Taliban? What is the national interest of United States in that circumstance? We went and did the mission. You've known my position for a long, long time. It's time to end this war.</p>, <p>The estimates of the cost of this war over the last 20 years ranged from a minimum of $1 trillion to a think tank at one of the universities saying $2 trillion. That's somewhere between $150 million a day and $300 million a day.</p>, <p>The threat from terrorism has metastasized. There's a greater danger from ISIS and Al Qaida and all these affiliates in other countries, by far, than there is from Afghanistan. And we're going to retain an over-the-horizon capability that if they were to come back, to be able to take them out, surgically move.</p>, <p>So this is where we should be. This is about America leading the world, and all our allies have agreed with that.</p>, <p>And by the way, before I made this decision, I was at the G-7, as well as—met with our NATO partners, and I told them all. Every one of them knew and agreed with the decision I made to an end—end—jointly end our involvement in Afghanistan.</p>, <p>The first part of your question was—I can't remember now.</p>, <p><i>Evacuation of Special Immigrant Visa Applicants From Afghanistan/U.S. Assistance to Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>It is: Are—would you commit to the same commitment—would you make the same commitment to bring out Afghans who assisted in the war effort?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. Yes. We're making the same commitment. There's no one more important than bringing American citizens out. I acknowledge that. But they're equally important, almost—is all those who—those ""SIVs,"" we call them, who, in fact, helped us. They were translators. They went into battle with us. They were part of the operation. As well as, we're also trying to get out as many NGOs—nongovernmental organizations—women's organizations, et cetera. We're doing all we can.</p>, <p>In the meantime, Secretary Blinken and I am going to be working with our allies to see to it that we can bring international pressure on the Taliban to be—they're looking to gain some legitimacy. They're going to have to figure out how they're going to maintain that country.</p>, <p>And there's going to be harsh conditions we're—strong condition we're going to apply. And it will depend on whether they get help—based on whether or not how and well they treat women and girls, how they treat their citizens.</p>, <p>So this is just beginning on that score.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>And are you willing to stay passed the 31st to make that happen—to bring all the Americans out, to bring those SIVs out?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I think we can get it done by then, but we're going to make that judgment as we go.</p>, <p>Now, Justin Sink of Bloomberg.</p>, <p><i>Afghan National Security Forces/U.S. Counterterrorism Efforts/U.S. Intelligence Gathering </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you, Mr. President. You just said that you would keep a laser focus on counterterrorism efforts and that you don't see as great of a threat of terrorism from Afghanistan as other parts of the world. But if you and your administration so badly misassessed how quickly the Taliban would sweep through Afghanistan and we no longer have an Embassy there from which to run intelligence operations, how can you at all be confident of your assessment of the risk of terrorism and the ability of the U.S. to conduct over-the-horizon missions to keep it in check? Can you tell Americans that they're safe and will remain safe from terror attacks in Afghanistan?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I think you're comparing apples and oranges. One question was whether or not the Afghan forces we trained up would stay and fight in their own civil war they had going on.</p>, <p>No one—I shouldn't say ""no one""—the consensus was that it was highly unlikely that in 11 days they'd collapse and fall, and the leader of Afghanistan would flee the country.</p>, <p>That's a very different question than whether or not there is the ability to observe whether or not large groups of terrorists began to accumulate in a particular area in Afghanistan to plot against the United States of America. That's why we retained an over-the-horizon capability to go in and do something about that if that occurs—if that occurs.</p>, <p>But in the meantime, we know what's happened around the world. We know what's happening in terms of what's going on in other countries, where there is the significant rise of terrorist organizations in the Middle East, in East Africa, and other places.</p>, <p>And so the bottom line is, we have to do—we're dealing with those terrorist threats from other parts of the world in failed states without permanent military presence there. We have to do the same in Afghanistan.</p>, <p><i>Timeline for the Withdrawal of U.S. Military Forces From Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>And, sir, just on that initial assessment: We've learned, over the last 24 hours, that there was a dissent cable from the State Department——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Sure.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>——saying that the Taliban would come faster through Afghanistan. Can you say why, after that cable was issued, the U.S. didn't do more to get Americans out?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> We've got all kind of cables, all kinds of advice. If you notice, it ranged from this group saying that—they didn't say it'd fall when it would fall—when it did fall—but saying that it would fall; to others saying it wouldn't happen for a long time and they'd be able to sustain themselves through the end of the year.</p>, <p>I made the decision. The buck stops with me. I took the consensus opinion. The consensus opinion was that, in fact, it would not occur, if it occurred, until later in the year. So it was my decision.</p>, <p>Now, my—I've got—my next is Stephanie Ramos, ABC.</p>, <p><i>Evacuation of U.S. Citizens From Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you, Mr. President. Two questions for you. The military has secured the airport, as you mentioned, but will you sign off on sending U.S. troops into Kabul to evacuate Americans who haven't been able to get to the airport safely?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> We have no indication that they haven't been able to get—in Kabul—through the airport. We've made an agreement with the—with the Taliban. Thus far, they've allowed them to go through. It's in their interest for them to go through. So we know of no circumstance where American citizens are—carrying an American passport—are trying to get through to the airport. But we will do whatever needs to be done to see to it they get to the airport.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Evacuation of Special Immigrant Visa Applicants From Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>And one more, Mr. President. Last month, my colleague Martha Raddatz interviewed Abdul, an interpreter who was on the frontlines with U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Overnight, we received a photo of Taliban militants coming to the door of his home, literally hunting him down. Thankfully, he was able to escape, but he is obviously still in mortal danger. What would be your message to Abdul, his wife, and his three young daughters?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> We want you to be able to get to the airport. Contact us. We'll see whatever we can do to get you there. We've got to get you out. We are committed to deal with you, your wife, and your child—to get all three of you out of Afghanistan. That's the commitment.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you, sir.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Meredith Lee of PBS NewsHour.</p>, <p><i>U.S. Evacuation Efforts From Kabul, Afghanistan/Taliban/Withdrawal of U.S. Military Forces From Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned just now using every resource available for evacuations. Why haven't you ordered the military to expand the security perimeter around the Kabul airport? Do you have any plans to do so, given that it will likely require more U.S. troops? And are you considering rescue operations to recover Americans and Afghan allies stuck behind Taliban checkpoints?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> The last answer is yes—to the last question. We're considering every opportunity and every means by which we can get folks to the airport. That's number one.</p>, <p>Number two, the reason why we have not gone out and started—and set up a perimeter way outside the airport in Kabul is that it's likely to draw an awful lot of unintended consequences in terms of people who, in fact, are not part of the Taliban.</p>, <p>We've been in constant contact with the Taliban leadership on the ground in Kabul, as well as the Taliban leadership at Daho [Doha],* and we've been coordinating what we are doing.</p>, <p>That's why we were able—for example, how we got all of our Embassy personnel out, how we got everyone out of the Embassy safely that was at distance. That's how we helped get the French out and—out of their Embassy.</p>, <p>So the question remains—there will be judgments made on the ground by the military commanders at the moment, and that—I cannot second-guess each of those judgments to be made.</p>, <p>But the idea of—again, let me get back to the fundamental point I made at the outset. When the decision was made by me that—and it was made some time ago, when I ran for President saying I wanted to get us out of Afghanistan—one of the things that is a reality is, people now say to me and to others—and many of you say it on air—that: Why did we have to move? Because no Americans are being attacked. Why did we withdraw those—why did we agree to withdraw 2,500 troops? No Americans were being attacked.</p>, <p>As I said before, the reason they weren't being attacked was part of an agreement that Trump had made a year earlier. ""We will leave by May 1,"" he said, ""as long as there's no attack on Americans in that year, period."" Number one.</p>, <p>Number two, the Taliban was taking large swaths of the countryside, north and south—none of the major areas, none of the major points of the capitals of each of these provinces, but they were all over the country.</p>, <p>And the idea that if I had said on May the 2d or 3d, ""We are not leaving; we are staying""—does anybody truly believe that I would not have had to put in significantly more American forces—send your sons, your daughters—like my son was sent to Iraq—to maybe die? And for what? For what?</p>, <p>So the only rational thing to do, in my view, was to set up and preposition American forces for the purpose of evacuation, and the aircraft—to preposition those ahead of time so that we would be able to begin the process of evacuation of American citizens, SIVs, and others who helped us.</p>, <p>The last point I'll make is this: Look, if we had decided 15 years ago to leave Afghanistan, it would have been really difficult. If we decided 5 years ago—if we start—if we continued the war for another decade and tried to leave, there's no way in which you'd be able to leave Afghanistan without there being some of what you're seeing now.</p>, <p>But what we've done so far is, we've been able to get a large number of Americans out, all our personnel at the Embassy out, and so on. And thank God, so far—knock on wood—we're in a different position.</p>, <p>Scott Detrow. Scott. NPR.</p>, <p><i>Evacuation of U.S. Citizens From Afghanistan/Taliban Cooperation </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to follow up on something you said a moment ago. You said that there's no circumstances where American citizens cannot get to the airport. That doesn't really square with the images we're seeing around the airport and with the reporting on the ground from our colleagues who are describing chaos and violence. Are you saying unequivocally that any American who wants to get to the airport is getting there and getting past the security barrier and to the planes where they want to go?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I thought the question was: How can they get through to the airport outside the airport? And the answer is: To the best of our knowledge, the Taliban checkpoints—they are letting through people showing American passports.</p>, <p>Now, that's a different question when they get into the rush and crowd of all the folks just outside the wall near the airport. That's why we had to, I guess—was it yesterday or the day before?—we went over the wall and brought in, how many?</p>, <p><i>National Security Adviser Jacob J. Sullivan.</i> A hundred and sixty-nine.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> A hundred and sixty-nine Americans. So it is a process to try to figure out how we deal with the mad rush of non-Americans—those who didn't help, those who are not on a priority list, just any Afghan—any Afghan—to be able to get out of the country.</p>, <p>And so my guess is that, no matter what, under what circumstances we—anyone—there's not a whole lot of Afghanis—there's a whole lot of Afghanis that just as soon come to America, whether there were any involvement with the United States in the past at all, rather than stay under Taliban rule or any rule.</p>, <p>So what I was saying is that we have an agreement that they will let pass through the checkpoints that they—the Taliban—control. They've let Americans through.</p>, <p><i>Taliban/Afghan National Security Forces </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>But given this—given the negotiations with the Taliban, the scenes that we're seeing, can you just fully explain why the plan wasn't to go ahead with these evacuations of both Americans and allies before the drawdowns began, before Bagram was closed, looking back several months? Because whether it was now or several months from now, there seems to be a broad consensus that the Taliban would make these gains and these would be needed at some point.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, yes, at some point. But the point was that although we were in contact with the Taliban and Doha for this whole period of time, that ""some point"" wasn't expected to be the total demise of the Afghan National Force, which was 300 [thousand]* persons.</p>, <p>Let's assume the Afghan National Force had continued to fight and had—and they were surrounding Kabul. It'd be a very different story. Very different story.</p>, <p>But the overwhelming consensus was that they—this was not—they were not going to collapse. The Afghan forces, they were not going to leave. They were not going to just abandon and then put down their arms and take off. So that's what's happened.</p>, <p>Thank you very, very much. Thank you.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, several reporters began speaking at once.</i>]</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Why do you continue to trust the Taliban?</p>]"

I'd like to make an important announcement today in our work to get every American vaccinated and protected from the Delta virus—the Delta variant of COVID-19.</p>, <p>I just got a lengthy briefing from my COVID team, and here's the latest data that confirms we're still in a pandemic of the unvaccinated. While we're starting to see initial signs that cases may be declining in a few places, cases are still rising, especially among the unvaccinated. There are still 85 million Americans who are eligible to get vaccinated who remain unvaccinated and at real risk.</p>, <p>Across the country, virtually all of the COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths continue to be among the unvaccinated. In Alabama, more than 90 percent of the current hospitalizations are among the unvaccinated. In Texas, 95 percent of those in hospitals are unvaccinated. Right now it's worse in States where overall vaccination rates are low.</p>, <p>But let me be clear: Even in States where the vaccination rate is high, the unvaccinated in those States are also at risk, and we're seeing cases rise as a result. Quite frankly, it's a tragedy. There are people who are dying and who will die who didn't have to. So please, if you haven't gotten vaccinated, do it now. Do it now. It could save your life, and it could save the lives of those you love.</p>, <p>You know, and the good news is that more people are getting vaccinated. Overall, weekly, new vaccinations are up more than 80 percent from where they were a month ago. While it can take up to 6 weeks to get fully protected after your first shot, this increased level of vaccination is going to provide results in the weeks ahead.</p>, <p>Just remember, we have two key—and two key ways of protecting ourselves against COVID-19: one: safe, free, and effective vaccines; and two, masks. Vaccines are the best defense, but masks are extremely helpful as well.</p>, <p>And for those who aren't eligible for the vaccine yet—children under the age of 12—masks are the best available protection for them and the adults around them. That's why we need to make sure children are wearing masks in school.</p>, <p>Before I talk about the news related to vaccines, let me say a few words about masks and our children. Unfortunately, as we've seen throughout this pandemic, some politicians are trying to turn public safety measures—that is, children wearing masks in school—into political disputes for their own political gain. Some are even trying to take power away from local educators by banning masks in school. They're setting a dangerous tone.</p>, <p>For example, last week, at a school board meeting in Tennessee, protesters threatened doctors and nurses who were testifying, making the case for masking children in schools. The intimidation and the threats we're seeing across the country are wrong. They're unacceptable.</p>, <p>And I've said before, this isn't about politics. It's about keeping our children safe. This is about taking on the virus together, united. I've made it clear that I'll stand with those who are trying to do the right thing.</p>, <p>Last week, I called school superintendents in Florida and Arizona to thank them for doing the right thing and requiring masks in their schools. One of them said, ""We teach science, so we follow the science."" The other said they have a guiding principle: ""Students first."" I couldn't agree with more than—I just couldn't agree more with what they both said.</p>, <p>And that's why today I am directing the Secretary of Education—an educator himself—to take additional steps to protect our children. This includes using all of his oversights authorities and legal actions, if appropriate, against Governors who are trying to block and intimidate local school officials and educators.</p>, <p>And I've said—as I've said before, if you aren't going to fight COVID-19, at least get out of the way of everyone else who is trying. You know, we're not going to sit by as Governors try to block and intimidate educators protecting our children. For example, if a Governor wants to cut the pay of a hard-working education leader who requires masks in the classroom, the money from the American Rescue Plan can be used to pay that person's salary, 100 percent.</p>, <p>I'm going to say a lot more about children and schools next week. But as we head into the school year, remember this: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, says masks are critical, especially for those who are not yet vaccinated, like our children under the age of 12.</p>, <p>So let's put politics aside. Let's follow the educators and the scientists who know a lot more about how to teach our children and keep them safe than any politician. This administration is always going to take the side of our children.</p>, <p>Next, I want to talk to those who—of you who can get vaccinated, but you haven't. The Delta variant is twice as transmissible as the Alpha variant. It's dangerous, and it continues to spread. Vaccines are the key to stopping it, and we're making progress.</p>, <p>Today, more than 90 percent of seniors have at least had one shot, and 70 percent of people over the age 12 have gotten their first shot as well. That's good news, but we need to go faster.</p>, <p>That's why I'm taking steps on vaccination requirements where I can. Already, I've outlined vaccine requirements. We're going reach millions of Americans: Federal workers and contractors; medical staff caring for our veterans at VA hospitals; and our Active Duty military, Reservists, and National Guard.</p>, <p>Today I'm announcing a new step. If you work in a nursing home and serve people on Medicare or Medicaid, you will also be required to get vaccinated. More than 130,000 residents in nursing homes have—sadly, over the period of this virus—passed away.</p>, <p>At the same time, vaccination rates among nursing home staff significantly trail the rest of the country. The studies show that highly vaccinated nursing home staffs is associated with at least 30-percent less COVID-19 cases among long-term care residents.</p>, <p>With this announcement, I'm using the power of the Federal Government, as a payer of health care costs, to ensure we reduce those risks to our most vulnerable seniors. These steps are all about keeping people safe and out of harm's way.</p>, <p>If you walk into a Government office building, you should know that Federal workers are doing everything possible to keep you safe. If you're a veteran seeking care at a VA hospital, you should not be at a greater risk walking into the hospital than you were outside the hospital. And now, if you visit, live, or work in a nursing home, you should not be at a high risk for contracting COVID from unvaccinated employees.</p>, <p>While I'm mindful that my authority at the Federal level is limited, I'm going to continue to look for ways to keep people safe and increase vaccination rates.</p>, <p>And I'm pleased to see the private sector stepping up as well. In the last week, AT&amp;T, Amtrak, McDonalds, they all announced vaccine requirements. I recently met with a group of business and education leaders—from United Airlines, to Kaiser Permanente, to Howard University—who are also doing the same thing.</p>, <p>Over 200 health systems, more than 50 in the past 2 weeks, have announced vaccine requirements. Colleges and universities are requiring more than 5 million students to be vaccinated as they return to classes this fall. All of this makes a difference.</p>, <p>The Wall Street Journal reported the share of job postings stating that new hires must be vaccinated has nearly doubled in the past month. Governors and mayors in California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, and Washington have all announced vaccination requirements.</p>, <p>So let's be clear: Vaccination requirements have been around for decades. Students, health care professionals, our troops are typically required to receive vaccines to prevent everything from polio to smallpox to measles to mumps to rubella.</p>, <p>In fact, the reason most people in America don't worry about polio, smallpox, measles, mumps, and rubella today is because of vaccines. It only makes sense to require a vaccine that stops the spread of COVID-19.</p>, <p>And it's time for others to step up. Employers have more power today to end this pandemic than they have ever had before. My message is simple: Do the right thing for your employees, consumers, and your businesses. Let's remember: The key tool to keeping our economy going strong is to get people vaccinated and at work.</p>, <p>I know that I'll have your back—they should know I'll have their back, as I have the back of the States trying to do the right thing as well. For example, yesterday I instructed the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to extend full reimbursement through the end of the year to State developments—to State deployments of National Guard in support of COVID-19 response.</p>, <p>Nearly 18,000 National Guard members are supporting our response nationwide, from caring for patients, to administering vaccines, to running testing sites, to distributing supplies. As the States continue to recover from the economic toll left by COVID-19, the full reimbursement of National Guard services during this pandemic will be another tool that will help them shore up their budgets, meet the needs of their communities, and continue our economic recovery.</p>, <p>These are the latest steps we're taking to get more people vaccinated.</p>, <p>Next, I want to speak to you all—all of you who are vaccinated. How should you be thinking about the moment we're in? First, know that you're highly protected against severe illness and death from COVID-19. Only a small fraction of people going to the hospital today are those who have been vaccinated. But we have a responsibility to give the maximum amount of protection—all of you the maximum amount.</p>, <p>Earlier today our medical experts announced a plan for booster shots to every fully vaccinated American—adult American. You know, this shot will boost your immune response. It will increase your protection from COVID-19. And it's the best way to protect ourselves from new variants that could arise.</p>, <p>The plan is for every adult to get a booster shot 8 months after you got your second shot. Pending approval from the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC's committee of outside experts, we'll be ready to start these booster—this booster program during the week of September 20, in which time anyone vaccinated on or before January 20 will be eligible to get a booster shot.</p>, <p>So that means that if you got your second shot on February 15, you're eligible to get your booster shot on October 15. If you got your second shot on March 15, go for your booster starting on November 15. And so on. Just remember, as a simple rule—rule: Eight months after your second shot, get a booster shot.</p>, <p>And these booster shots are free. We'd be able to get the booster shots at any one of the approximately 80,000 vaccination locations nationwide. It will be easy. Just show your vaccination card, and you'll get a booster. No other ID. No insurance. No State residency requirement.</p>, <p>My administration has been planning for this possibility and this scenario for months. We purchased enough vaccine and vaccine supplies so that when your 8-month mark comes up, you'll be ready to get your vaccination free—that booster shot free. And we have it available.</p>, <p>It will make you safer and for longer. And it will help us end the pandemic faster.</p>, <p>Now, I know there are some world leaders who say Americans shouldn't get a third shot until other countries got their first shot. I disagree. We can take care of America and help the world at the same time.</p>, <p>In June and July, America administered 50 million shots here in the United States, and we donated 100 million shots to other countries. That means that America has donated more vaccine to other countries than every other country in the world combined.</p>, <p>During the coming months of fall and early winter, we expect to give out another—about 100 thousand [million]* boosters, and the United States will donate more than 200 million additional doses to other countries. This will keep us on our way to meeting our pledge of more than 600 million vaccine donations—over half a billion. And I said—as I said before, we're going to be the arsenal of vaccines to beat this pandemic as we were the arsenal of democracy to win World War II.</p>, <p>So let me conclude with this: The threat of the Delta virus remains real. But we are prepared. We have the tools. We can do this. To all those of who are unvaccinated: Please get vaccinated for yourself and for your loved ones, your neighborhood and for your community.</p>, <p>And to the rest of America, this is no time to let our guard down. We just need to finish the job with science, with facts, and with confidence. And together, as the United States of America, we'll get this done.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.</p>]"
12,5,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the Situation in Afghanistan,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-situation-afghanistan,"[<p>Good afternoon.</p>, <p>I want to speak today to the unfolding situation in Afghanistan the developments that have taken place in the last week and the steps we're taking to address the rapidly evolving events.</p>, <p>My national security team and I have been closely monitoring the situation on the ground in Afghanistan and moving quickly to execute the plans we had put in place to respond to every constituency, including—and contingency—including the rapid collapse we're seeing now.</p>, <p>I'll speak more in a moment about the specific steps we're taking, but I want to remind everyone how we got here and what America's interests are in Afghanistan.</p>, <p>We went to Afghanistan almost 20 years ago with clear goals: get those who attacked us on September 11, 2001, and make sure Al Qaida could not use Afghanistan as a base from which to attack us again. We did that. We severely degraded Al Qaida in Afghanistan. We never gave up the hunt for Usama bin Laden, and we got him. That was a decade ago.</p>, <p>Our mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to have been nation building. It was never supposed to be creating a unified, centralized democracy. Our only vital national interest in Afghanistan remains today what it has always been: preventing and—a terrorist attack on American homeland.</p>, <p>I've argued for many years that our mission should be narrowly focused on counterterrorism, not counterinsurgency or nation building. That's why I opposed the surge when it was proposed in 2009 when I was Vice President.</p>, <p>And that's why, as President, I am adamant that we focus on the threats we face today in 2021, not yesterday's threats. Today, the terrorist threat has metastasized well beyond Afghanistan: al-Shabaab in Somalia, Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Nusra in Syria, ISIS attempting to create a caliphate in Syria and Iraq and establishing affiliates in multiple countries in Africa and Asia. These threats warrant our attention and our resources.</p>, <p>We conduct effective counterterrorism missions against terrorist groups in multiple countries where we don't have permanent military presence. If necessary, we'll do the same in Afghanistan. We've developed counterterrorism over-the-horizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region and to act quickly and decisively if needed.</p>, <p>When I came into office, I inherited a deal that President Trump negotiated with the Taliban. Under his agreement, U.S. forces would be out of Afghanistan by May 1, 2021, just a little over 3 months after I took office.</p>, <p>U.S. forces had already drawn down during the Trump administration from roughly 15,500 American forces to 2,500 troops in country, and the Taliban was at its strongest militarily since 2001. The choice I had to make, as your President, was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban in the middle of the spring fighting season.</p>, <p>There would have been no cease-fire after May 1. There was no agreement protecting our forces after May 1. There was no status quo of stability without American casualties after May 1.</p>, <p>There was only the cold reality of either following through on the agreement to withdraw our forces or escalating the conflict and sending thousands more American troops back into combat in Afghanistan, lurching into the third decade of conflict.</p>, <p>I stand squarely behind my decision. After 20 years, I've learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw U.S. forces. That's why we were still there. We were clear eyed about the risks. We planned for every contingency.</p>, <p>But I always promised the American people that I will be straight with you. The truth is: This did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated.</p>, <p>So what's happened? Afghanistan political leaders gave up and fled the country. The Afghan military collapsed, sometimes without trying to fight. If anything, the developments of the past week reinforced that ending U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan now was the right decision.</p>, <p>American troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves. We spent over a trillion dollars. We trained and equipped an Afghan military force of some 300,000 strong, incredibly well equipped, a force larger in size than the militaries of many of our NATO allies.</p>, <p>And we gave them every tool they could need. We paid their salaries, provided for the maintenance of their air force, something the Taliban doesn't have. Taliban does not have an air force. We've provided close air support. We gave them every chance to determine their own future. What we could not provide them was the will to fight for that future.</p>, <p>There's some very brave and capable Afghan special forces units and soldiers, but if Afghanistan is unable to mount any real resistance to the Taliban now, there is no chance that 1 year—1 more year, 5 more years, or 20 more years—of U.S. military boots on the ground would have made any difference.</p>, <p>And here's what I believe to my core: It is wrong to order American troops to step up when Afghanistan's own armed forces would not. If the political leaders of Afghanistan were unable to come together for the good of their people, unable to negotiate for the future of their country when the chips were down, they would never have done so while U.S. troops remained in Afghanistan bearing the brunt of the fighting for them.</p>, <p>And our true strategic competitors—China and Russia—would love nothing more than the United States to continue to funnel billions of dollars in resources and attention into stabilizing Afghanistan indefinitely.</p>, <p>When I hosted President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah at the White House in June and again when I spoke by phone to Ghani in July, we had very frank conversations. We talked about how Afghanistan should prepare to fight their civil wars after the U.S. military departed, to clean up the corruption in government so the government could function for the Afghan people. We talked extensively about the need for Afghan leaders to unite politically. They failed to do any of that.</p>, <p>I also urged them to engage in diplomacy, to seek a political settlement with the Taliban. This advice was flatly refused. Mr. Ghani insisted the Afghan forces would fight, but obviously, he was wrong.</p>, <p>So I am left again to ask of those who argue that we should stay: How many more generations of America's daughters and sons would you have me send to fight Afghans—Afghanistan's civil war when Afghan troops will not? How many more lives—American lives—is it worth? How many endless rows of headstones at Arlington National Cemetery?</p>, <p>I'm clear on my answer: I will not repeat the mistakes we've made in the past: the mistake of staying and fighting indefinitely in a conflict that is not in the national interest of the United States, of doubling down on a civil war in a foreign country, of attempting to remake a country through the endless military deployments of U.S. forces. Those are the mistakes we cannot continue to repeat, because we have significant vital interests in the world that we cannot afford to ignore.</p>, <p>I also want to acknowledge how painful this is to so many of us. The scenes we're seeing in Afghanistan, they're gut-wrenching, particularly for our veterans, our diplomats, humanitarian workers, for anyone who has spent time on the ground working to support the Afghan people.</p>, <p>For those who have lost loved ones in Afghanistan and for Americans who have fought and served in the country—serve our country in Afghanistan—this is deeply, deeply personal.</p>, <p>It is for me as well. I've worked on these issues as long as anyone. I've been throughout Afghanistan during this war—while the war was going on—from Kabul to Kandahar to the Kunar Valley. I've traveled there on four different occasions. I met with the people. I've spoken to the leaders. I spent time with our troops. And I came to understand firsthand what was and was not possible in Afghanistan.</p>, <p>So now we're focused on what is possible. We will continue to support the Afghan people. We will lead with our diplomacy, our international influence, and our humanitarian aid. We'll continue to push for regional diplomacy and engagement to prevent violence and instability. We'll continue to speak out for the basic rights of the Afghan people—of women and girls—just as we speak out all over the world.</p>, <p>I have been clear that human rights must be the center of our foreign policy, not the periphery. But the way to do it is not through endless military deployments, it's with our diplomacy, our economic tools, and rallying the world to join us.</p>, <p>Now, let me lay out the current mission in Afghanistan. I was asked to authorize—and I did—6,000 U.S. troops to deploy to Afghanistan for the purpose of assisting in the departure of U.S. and allied civilian personnel from Afghanistan and to evacuate our Afghan allies and vulnerable Afghans to safety outside of Afghanistan.</p>, <p>Our troops are working to secure the airfield and to ensure continued operation of both the civilian and military flights. We're taking over air traffic control. We have safely shut down our Embassy and transferred our diplomats. Our diplomatic presence is now consolidated at the airport as well.</p>, <p>Over the coming days, we intend to transport out thousands of American citizens who have been living and working in Afghanistan. We'll also continue to support the safe departure of civilian personnel—the civilian personnel of our allies—who are still serving in Afghanistan.</p>, <p>Operation Allies Refugee [Refuge],* which I announced back in July, has already moved 2,000 Afghans who are eligible for special immigration visas and their families to the United States. In the coming days, the U.S. military will provide assistance to move more SIV-eligible Afghans and their families out of Afghanistan.</p>, <p>We're also expanding refugee access to cover other vulnerable Afghans who worked for our Embassy: U.S. nongovernmental agencies—or the U.S. nongovernmental organizations; and Afghans who otherwise are at great risk; and U.S. news agencies.</p>, <p>I know that there are concerns about why we did not begin evacuating Afghans—civilians sooner. Part of the answer is, some of the Afghans did not want to leave earlier, still hopeful for their country. And part of it was because the Afghan Government and its supporters discouraged us from organizing a mass exodus to avoid triggering, as they said, ""a crisis of confidence.""</p>, <p>American troops are performing this mission as professionally and as effectively as they always do, but it is not without risks. As we carry out this departure, we have made it clear to the Taliban: If they attack our personnel or disrupt our operation, the U.S. presence will be swift and the response will be swift and forceful. We will defend our people with devastating force if necessary.</p>, <p>Our current military mission will be short in time, limited in scope, and focused in its objectives: Get our people and our allies to safety as quickly as possible. And once we have completed this mission, we will conclude our military withdrawal. We will end America's longest war after 20 long years of bloodshed.</p>, <p>The events we're seeing now are sadly proof that no amount of military force would ever deliver a stable, united, secure Afghanistan, as known in history as the ""graveyard of empires."" What is happening now could just as easily have happened 5 years ago or 15 years in the future. You have to be honest: Our mission in Afghanistan has taken many missteps—made many missteps over the past two decades.</p>, <p>I'm now the fourth American President to preside over war in Afghanistan, two Democrats and two Republicans. I will not pass this responsibly on—responsibility on to a fifth President. I will not mislead the American people by claiming that just a little more time in Afghanistan will make all the difference. Nor will I shrink from my share of responsibility for where we are today and how we must move forward from here. I am President of the United States of America, and the buck stops with me.</p>, <p>I am deeply saddened by the facts we now face. But I do not regret my decision to end America's warfighting in Afghanistan and maintain a laser focus on our counterterrorism missions there and other parts of the world.</p>, <p>Our mission to degrade the terrorist threat of Al Qaida in Afghanistan and kill Usama bin Laden was a success. Our decades-long effort to overcome centuries of history and permanently change and remake Afghanistan was not, and I wrote and believed it never could be.</p>, <p>I cannot and I will not ask our troops to fight on endlessly in another country's civil war, taking casualties, suffering life-shattering injuries, leaving families broken by grief and loss. This is not in our national security interest. It is not what the American people want. It is not what our troops, who have sacrificed so much over the past two decades, deserve.</p>, <p>I made a commitment to the American people when I ran for President that I would bring America's military involvement in Afghanistan to an end. And while it's been hard and messy—and yes, far from perfect—I've honored that commitment.</p>, <p>More importantly, I made a commitment to the brave men and women who serve this Nation that I wasn't going to ask them to continue to risk their lives in a military action that should have ended long ago. Our leaders did that in Vietnam when I got here as a young man. I will not do it in Afghanistan.</p>, <p>I know my decision will be criticized, but I would rather take all that criticism than pass this decision on to another President of the United States—yet another one—a fifth one.</p>, <p>Because it's the right one—it's the right decision for our people. The right one for our brave servicemembers who have risked their lives serving our Nation. And it's the right one for America.</p>, <p>Thank you. May God protect our troops, our diplomats, and all of the brave Americans serving in harm's way.</p>]"
12,6,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on Prescription Drug Prices,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prescription-drug-prices-1,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good afternoon.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Prevention Efforts </i></p>, <p>Before I begin, let me say a few words about the pandemic, the pandemic of the unvaccinated. I know there are lot of people out there trying to turn a public safety measure—that is, children wearing masks in school so they can be safe—into a political dispute. And this isn't about politics. This is about keeping our children safe.</p>, <p>I saw a video and reports from Tennessee of protesters threatening doctors and nurses who were before a schoolboard making the case that, to keep kids safe, there should be mandatory masks. And as they walked out, these doctors were threatened, these nurses were threatened.</p>, <p>You know, our health care workers are heroes. They were the heroes when there was no vaccine. Many of them gave their lives trying to save others. And they're heroes again with a vaccine. They're doing their best to care for the people refusing to get vaccinated—unvaccinated folks who are being hospitalized and dying as a result of not being vaccinated.</p>, <p>To the mayors, school superintendents, educators, local leaders who are standing up to the Governors politicizing mask protection for our kids—thank you, thank you as well. Thank God that we have heroes like you, and I stand with you all, and America should as well.</p>, <p><i>Prescription Drug Prices </i></p>, <p>Now, let me turn to the focus of today's remarks. There aren't a lot of things that almost every American can agree on. But I think it's safe to say that all of us—whatever our background, our age, or where we live—can agree that prescription drug prices are outrageously expensive in America.</p>, <p>Today I'd like to talk about how we're going to help millions of Americans save money and ease their burdens by lowering the cost of prescription drugs.</p>, <p>Let me start by acknowledging the groundbreaking and lifesaving work that many pharmaceutical companies are doing. Look no further than the vaccines they are manufacturing and delivering that are helping us beat this pandemic and save lives.</p>, <p>But we can make a distinction between developing these breakthroughs and jacking up prices on a range of medications for a range of everyday diseases and conditions.</p>, <p>Right now, right here in America, we pay the highest prescription drug costs of any developed nation in the world. Let me say that again: of any developed nation in the world. About two to three times what other countries pay.</p>, <p>Last week, in the Oval Office, I hosted a small-business owner named Gail from Denver. She's 60 years old. When she was 11, she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. For nearly 50 years, she's had to take insulin to stay alive.</p>, <p>But you know what she told me? She said she doesn't worry about becoming blind or her blood sugar dropping dangerously low, the natural worries of anyone with type 1 diabetes. She worries about being able to pay for her prescription drugs.</p>, <p>During our conversation, she pulled out a vial of insulin from her bag. In 2001, she said, that single vial cost $32 a bottle. Today, that exact same bottle, with the same exact formula—no changes—costs $280 per bottle.</p>, <p>Gail and her husband work hard. They spend wisely. But because of the cost of her prescription drugs, her husband may not be able to retire. They drive the same car, she said, she's had for 17 years, unable to afford repairs or a new one. And Gail is not alone.</p>, <p>It's estimated that more than 34 million Americans—10 percent of the population of the United States—have diabetes, including more than 1.5 million of those who have type 1 diabetes. And the outrageous cost, affecting everyone across the board, spanning every kind of condition and disease, is similar.</p>, <p>I remember what it was like for my mom as she got older and moved in with us. Her prescription drugs were so expensive that it took me, my two brothers, and my sister—three siblings—chipping in to cover the thousands of dollars in monthly costs that she did—that she had to exhaust, rather than exhaust the little savings she had, for her prescription drugs.</p>, <p>It's personal to so many of us and so many of you. You know, for more than 1 million Americans living with multiple sclerosis, one common drug for that disease costs $7,100 per month. The price has gone up 1,000 percent over the last 20 years without any change in the drug.</p>, <p>For more than 1 million people with rheumatoid arthritis, a common prescription drug used to cost about $1,350 per month; that was when it was introduced back in 2003. Today, the same drug costs $7,700 per month, over five times more expensive without any change.</p>, <p>For years, the price of many prescription drugs has dramatically outpaced inflation. These prices have put the squeeze on too many families and stripped them of their dignity. They've been forced—we force people into terrible choices, between maintaining their health, paying the rent or the mortgage, putting food on the table. I mean, literally. And that's the case for a lot of working families and seniors, even if you can get the care you need.</p>, <p>But today, working families and too many seniors are struggling to make it work. Today, one in four Americans who take prescription drugs struggle to afford them. Nearly 30 percent have skipped doses, cut pills in half, or—because they can't afford the cost. We have to change this, and we can.</p>, <p>My administration has already taken significant steps to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Last month, I signed an Executive order that has the effect of improving competition in the economy, which will result in lower prescription drug costs.</p>, <p>Right now, when a drug company seeks permission from the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, for a certain drug to get a patent, it's allowed—the patent—it's allowed to exclusively sell that drug without competition for up to 12 years. When that time period expires, other companies can come along, make the same exact drug, and sell it cheaper. It's called a generic drug.</p>, <p>But unfortunately, it often takes a long time—years and years—for this to happen. That's why I've instructed the Federal Drug Administration to get these genetic [generic]* drugs to consumers faster. This is going to increase competition, lower drug prices for everyone.</p>, <p>Research shows that prices could be cut by 25 to 33 percent and save $54 billion for consumers over the next 10 years. Makes a gigantic difference for an average family.</p>, <p>Secondly, I've ordered the FDA to work with States and Tribes to import prescription drugs safely from Canada. These are drugs that the FDA has determined are safe. And they're going to make sure the drugs get to the States and Tribes safely.</p>, <p>Colorado estimates that their version of the drug importation program is going to save $35 million to $60 million a year for people in Colorado, cutting the prices down by more than 60 percent for the cost of the same drug.</p>, <p>These things—and by the way, you know, the company that's making these drugs and causing—and charging exorbitant prices are selling the same drug in other countries at considerably lower prices. It's not like there's another company always making this drug—same outfit.</p>, <p>These thing by themselves will be a great help. But to really solve the problem, we need Congress to act. That's what my Build Back Better plan will do. You know, there's long been talk—I mean, a long time, since the days when I was back in the Senate—about giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices.</p>, <p>Now, Medicare takes care of millions of people. Medicare—my plan is going to allow that. Every other type of health care service—from the cost of a doctor's visit, how much a doctor can charge for a visit, hospital visits, crutches, wheelchairs—Medicare is allowed to negotiate and say, ""We'll pay no more, from the Medicare, than the following amount for those things.""</p>, <p>As I've said before, the only thing Medicare is not allowed to negotiate are prices for prescription drugs. My plan gets rid of that prohibition. The proposal I made while I was running for President is that Medicare should negotiate drug prices across the board.</p>, <p>Congress is currently debating a more narrow vision letting Medicare negotiate some of the most expensive drugs, particularly from those companies that don't face competition for that drug. We're going to provide that competition through Medicare. Medicare is going to negotiate a fair price.</p>, <p>Right now drug companies will set a price at whatever the market will bear. Some of you may remember when I had the Moonshot going as—when I was Vice President. I met with 12 drug companies. And I agreed I would not name them at the time; it was just a private discussion. I said, ""If any one of you came up with a drug that cured a particular type of cancer, what do you think you should be able to charge for it?"" They said: ""Whatever the market would bear. Whatever it will bear.""</p>, <p>But that often means a significant number of people can't afford it under any circumstance and they'll die without it. That's unacceptable.</p>, <p>What we're proposing is that we'll negotiate a base—negotiate with the company based on a fair price, one that reflects the costs of the research and development and the need for providing for a significant profit, but that's still affordable for consumers.</p>, <p>And by the way, if there was a significant amount that's invested in it and a fair price is very expensive, we're going to have to figure out how society can provide for that drug that will save lives if people who can't afford it. But that's what we are trying to get done. And it has to get done.</p>, <p>But not only that my plan caps the amount that seniors have to spend on prescription drugs each year at no more than about $3,000 a year, our plan says that drug companies can only raise prices based on the rate of inflation after it's determined how much they've invested and what a healthy profit constitutes.</p>, <p>Studies have shown that if we do this, we can save seniors thousands of dollars a year. For example, an expensive drug for a cancer called multiple myeloma can cost $20,000 a month. Twenty thousand dollars a month. People who need that drug pay an average of $1,300 a month out of pocket, even with Medicare.</p>, <p>What I'm proposing would reduce the total cost by thousands of dollars and seniors would not pay more than $250 a month on average. That'd be a game changer. And by the way, it isn't just seniors who will benefit. This would lower prescription drug prices for all Americans. And here's how: If Medicare prices are available to private insurance companies, then it would reduce the cost of employer-based health insurance coverage.</p>, <p>What that means is: Once Medicare negotiates a lower drug price for its beneficiaries, an employer-based plan shouldn't have to keep paying whatever the drug company demands. They should get access to the same drug for the same price as Medicare.</p>, <p>So, if you're not on Medicare—you get your prescription drugs through your employer-based plan—your plan should pay the same price for that drug as someone on Medicare. It means drug companies would have to sell their drugs to all distributors at the Medicare price or face up to a 95-percent excise tax. The savings for employers and employees would be billions of dollars a year.</p>, <p>We don't have to stop there. My plan expands Medicare by adding dental, vision, and hearing, which would make a world of difference for millions of people.</p>, <p>We can take some of that savings created when Medicare is no longer forced to overpay prescription drugs and use it to pay for these additional benefits and reduce premiums, improve access for people with coverage on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.</p>, <p>You know, at the same time, we can invest in medical breakthroughs that will also reduce the costs and save lives. Right now, when Americans overpay for prescription drugs, too many pharmaceutical companies don't use the profit nearly enough to innovate or research. Too many companies use it to buy back their own stock, inflate their worth, drive up CEO salaries and compensation, and find ways to box out the competition.</p>, <p>In fact, according to one study, from 2016 to 2020, pharmaceutical companies spent $577 billion in stock buybacks and dividends, $56 billion more than what they spent on all research and development over that same period of time.</p>, <p>Look, folks, they should be able to make a significant progress—profit, but why should we be paying two or three times what every other country in the world is paying for a similar drug? There's so much we can do.</p>, <p>For example, at the Defense Department—for those of you who cover the Defense area—there's something called the DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, set up exclusively within the Defense Department to seek out the cutting-edge research protects that enhance our national security. An outfit that came up with the internet, GPS, and a lot of stealth technology—a lot of things.</p>, <p>I'm proposing we do a similar thing. I propose we spend $6.5 billion for a similar agency within the National Institute of Health—the NIH—called Advanced Research Project Agency, ARPA-H—like DARPA—to help speed cutting-edge research on how to detect, treat, and cure diseases like Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cancer.</p>, <p>It's personal to so many people out there, and we can do this. I'm not criticizing companies that aren't prepared to spend billions of dollars on certain projects to research. I get it. But if they're not, we should, to make sure the American—Americans are covered.</p>, <p>And here's one other big thing that will help millions of Americans afford their prescription drugs: getting them affordable health insurance. If anyone is worried about getting health insurance during the pandemic, there's help today. For those who get their insurance through the Affordable Care Act, we're covering more people, with better benefits, and with the premiums 40-percent lower.</p>, <p>That means the average premium has been cut by—from $104 a month to $62 a month. Sixty-two dollars a month for quality health insurance that covers doctors visits, hospital care, and prescription drugs. In fact, one-third of the consumers are buying plans through the Affordable Care Act for less than $10 a month.</p>, <p>Earlier this week, I announced that more than two-million-five-hundred-thousand Americans have signed up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act since I called for the special enrollment period during this pandemic. Folks, if you don't have insurance, you can still sign up under the Affordable Care Act through Sunday, August the 15th. Just go to healthcare.gov today, and get covered.</p>, <p>To all those folks expressing concern about rising costs for families, I urge you to support these basic reforms that will allow drug companies to still make billions of dollars, as they have a right to do, but will address one of the largest out-of-pocket expenses that families face: prescription drugs. We can do this.</p>, <p>Let me close with this: I've long said health care should be a right, not a privilege in this country. With my Build Back Better Plan, we have an opportunity to come together and get us even closer to that reality.</p>, <p>And the American people support it by overwhelming bipartisan margins. This isn't a partisan issue. Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancer, they don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican. This is about whether or not you and your loved ones can afford prescription drugs you need.</p>, <p>I look forward to Congress getting this done. And there's another area—this is another area where you can come together and make a difference in people's lives.</p>, <p>Thank you, may God bless you, may God protect our troops. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President—[<i>inaudible</i>]——</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.</i>]</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, is Afghanistan lost?

12,7,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks During a Virtual Meeting With State, Tribal, and Local Officials on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and an Exchange With Reporters",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-during-virtual-meeting-with-state-tribal-and-local-officials-the-infrastructure,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Hello, folks. Sorry I'm a few minutes late. It's good to see you all. Gretchen, how are you?</p>, <p>I understand we have another 95,000 people on this Zoom, but apparently, there's a large number of folks on. I'm going to begin by thanking you all—all those of you I can't see as well—for signing on to help pass the infrastructure bill. It mattered a lot. It's the first big bipartisan thing we've done in a long while, and I think it's long overdue. And it is great to see you all.</p>, <p>Yesterday the Senate passed the bipartisan infrastructure bill, in no small part because of all of you, in a significant milestone in the road toward making what we all know are long-overdue and much-needed investments. As Gretchen, when she ran, said, ""Just fix the roads, damn it."" Right? Well, we're going to do more than that this time around.</p>, <p>I want to thank you for the work and for all of you—and my administration, with the Members of Congress, with the media—to highlight the need to make these investments in our Nation's infrastructure.</p>, <p>As mayors, Governors, Tribal and county leaders, State and local officials at every level, you know that there's no such thing as a Democratic road or a Republican bridge. But you do know what's not working, and you know what it means to be accountable to the people you serve and to focus on solving real problems people are facing in your communities.</p>, <p>But you also know that often States and cities and counties can't do it alone. They need the Federal Government to be a partner, solving problems. And being a partner is what we're supposed to be doing.</p>, <p>That's the approach we've been taking with this bipartisan infrastructure bill. It's going to create literally millions of jobs, good-paying jobs, putting America on a path to win the 21st-century global economy. And we're in a competition with many other nations.</p>, <p>And it makes key investments to put people to work in cities, small towns, and rural communities. And I believe it's a historic investment in roads and rail, in transit and bridges, in clean energy and clean water. And it's going to enable us not only to build back, but to build back better than ever before.</p>, <p>Across America, more than 45,000 bridges are structurally deficient. Let me say that again: 45,000 bridges in America are structurally deficient. One out of every five miles of highway is in disrepair. And this bill makes the largest investment in bridges since the creation of the Interstate Highway System.</p>, <p>You know, 10 million households, and 400,000 schools, daycare centers—they lack safe drinking water. This bill is going to allow us to replace 100 percent of the Nation's lead pipes and service lines so every child in America can turn on a faucet in their school or at home and drink clean water.</p>, <p>That's what this infrastructure is all about today. We're going to need to build the infrastructure for tomorrow, not just today. We've got to build back not just—well, I know you're tired of hearing me say it, but build back better that it was before we hit this God-awful circumstance we found ourselves in.</p>, <p>This bill is going to deliver high-speed internet to every American. And we'll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations.</p>, <p>And here is another important part of the bill: Nearly 90 percent of the jobs created by this bill don't require a college degree. This is the ultimate blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America.</p>, <p>And we're going to do it without raising taxes by 1 cent on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. That's why we wouldn't even support a gas—increased gas tax.</p>, <p>As we did with the transcontinental railroad and Interstate Highway System, we're going to once again transform America and propel this Nation into the future.</p>, <p>Look, I believe that passing this bill will also do something else: It will help ease the years of gridlock in Washington and show the American people that their Government can and will work for them again. We're going to still have big disagreements, but it's happening at a critical time, because now is the moment to build our—on our momentum.</p>, <p>Folks, we've added more than 4 million new jobs since my first day in office 6 months ago. The unemployment rate is the lowest since the pandemic hit. We're delivering a tax cut to families with children every single month. And those who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, we're covering more people, and we're able to do it at lower premiums by up to 40 percent.</p>, <p>And it's a battle with Delta virus. We have the tools. We have the vaccinations. We have—we need to vaccinate more Americans and the tools to keep our economy growing and growing. But we've got to get more people vaccinated. I know you all know that well.</p>, <p>We just have to act. And that's what I want to talk about today. I want to hear from you about these investments: what they're going to mean for your States and communities; what we could have done better, if there's things we could have done; and why it is so urgent.</p>, <p>And so let me start with Governor Whitmer. We all remember your campaign slogan, Gov—[<i>laughter</i>]—that you've been focused on trying to fix the roads in your State since you took office. And what will this Federal investments in Michigan roads and bridges do and mean to your State's economy and job creation?</p>, <p>So—and then I want to hear from the rest of you. But I'll go one at a time, if that's okay.</p>, <p><i>Governor Gretchen E. Whitmer of Michigan.</i> Sounds perfect.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Gretchen, fire away.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Whitmer.</i> All right. Thanks, Mr. President. I'm so glad to be here with you. It's my honor to be here as the Governor of the great State of Michigan as we come together to make the largest infrastructure investment in American history.</p>, <p>And, Mr. President, you mentioned it, but I ran on fixing the damn roads.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I remember. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Gov. Whitmer.</i> And you know, and it's fixing the dams and roads. You know, don't think I haven't noticed that so many other Governors and Cabinet Secretaries have been stealing that tagline. But, of course, it's because it is true across the Nation, right?</p>, <p>[<i>Gov. Whitmer continued her remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>So this is a much-needed investment in moving us towards an electric future, and it may be the momentum we need for bigger investments in the future.</p>, <p>Now, our Senators Stabenow and Peters spearheaded a record $1 billion investment in the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Whitmer.</i> It will help us clean up and restore the beautiful freshwater lakes and preserve our picturesque peninsulas.</p>, <p>And finally, the package includes $10 billion to help us continue cleaning up toxic chemicals and contaminants from our water supply. It includes $4 billion to help water utilities remove chemicals from their supply or to connect well owners to local systems and another $5 billion to help small or disadvantaged communities tackle PFAS in drinking water.</p>, <p>[<i>Gov. Whitmer continued her remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>And I'm so glad to be with you today.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, thank you. And by the way, you know, I think, sort of breaking through this first big barrier in a bipartisan way, I really believe—it doesn't make everything easy, but it does have a way—it has an effect on other things.</p>, <p>I noticed that you mentioned having—I had the three presidents of the three major American automobile companies, the UAW, and all of the—all the auto workers in my backyard here at the White House with their electric vehicles. The commitment is to get 40—I believe, 50 percent of all our vehicles in America be electric vehicles, with 550,000 charging stations along the highways that are being repaired and—you know, or built.</p>, <p>And you know, that means, for Michigan, if I'm looking at my notes here, you're going to receive $110 million dollars for the expansion of EV charging networks.</p>, <p>So I just think, hopefully, this makes people realize if the autoworkers and the automobile executives can get together and form this kind of alliance, I think we're making some real progress.</p>, <p>But thank you, Jennifer [Gretchen],* for what you've done and continue to do.</p>, <p>And, Mr. Mayor—Jerry, I don't want to get you in trouble out in Fresno, California, for letting you know I actually like a Republican. But you've done a hell of a job. I'm anxious to hear about your electric buses later.</p>, <p>But, anyway, the floor is yours, Jerry.</p>, <p><i>Mayor Jerry Dyer of Fresno, CA.</i> Thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership on this critical infrastructure package. You know, there are really many things to like about this infrastructure bill, beginning with bipartisan support. That always makes it easier on us at the local level, as you mentioned. And the last time I checked, both Republican and Democrats alike travel on our roadways and cross our bridges, use mass transit, and breathe the same air.</p>, <p>So, unfortunately, Fresno, along with Los Angeles, our neighbors to the south, had some of the worst air quality in the Nation——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Mayor Dyer. </i>——which is why we're focused on transitioning to clean air buses in Fresno, as you mentioned. In fact, we rolled out our first two electric buses last week——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I know.</p>, <p><i>Mayor Dyer. </i>——thanks to a Federal Transportation Administration grant. Thank you, Mr. President, to your administration. And this bill, I believe, will accelerate those efforts here in Fresno.</p>, <p>Second, as you know, Fresno is ground zero to—for California's high-speed rail efforts.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Mayor Dyer.</i> And I'm proud to say that Fresno will be host to the Nation's first high-speed rail station right here in downtown Fresno. And so Federal assistance is vital in order to complete this project. And I'm hopeful that this infrastructure bill will provide that financial support to us here in Fresno.</p>, <p>And Fresno, like many cities, is in the midst of airport expansion with the addition of a new terminal at our Fresno Yosemite International Airport this coming year. And certainly, this bill has the potential to expedite our airport expansion as well.</p>, <p>And with the changing climate and drought conditions in California, we are facing, on a weekly basis, life-threatening wildfires that not only put our power grid in danger locally, but our firefighters as well. And this bill will strengthen our power grid by investing in it, which is vital in our region. And it's very important that we do so in order to avoid some of the rolling blackouts that we experience here in Fresno as a matter of routine.</p>, <p>And lastly, unfortunately—and I'm not proud of this—but Fresno is number two in poverty in the State of California. We have a very poor valley, a very poor region. Most of our jobs historically have been agricultural-centric, although that is changing. And this infrastructure bill will create good-paying, meaningful jobs, which are desperately needed in Fresno and throughout our region, and allow us to build upon those agricultural jobs that we've been relying upon.</p>, <p>So I just want to say, on—as the mayor of Fresno and as a Republican, I am very grateful for your leadership, Mr. President on this infrastructure package—making it a priority with your administration, considering—or taking into consideration input from State and local jurisdictions, as well as working diligently to pursue that bipartisan support.</p>, <p>So thank you again, and we are here to assist and take advantage of that funding.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Jerry—thank you, Mr. Mayor. Look, I'm not being solicitous, but we kind of had Fresno in mind—I'm not joking—because the air quality, the—where you sit, how tough it is for you there. And you know, all the things you mentioned have an impact—are going to allow you to have an impact on air quality.</p>, <p>You know me, because you're aware of it, I'm a big rail guy.</p>, <p><i>Mayor Dyer.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> We have more money in this area for high-speed rail than all the money we spend on setting up Amtrak. This is a gigantic investment. And you know as well as I do, when people can take a train from point A to point B—conveniently and faster than you can drive your vehicle—they take the train.</p>, <p>We're talking about electric. We're talking about electric. We're not talking diesels. We're talking about electric. And we're talking about being able to transform and impact on the air quality in your area, because of geographic location and the spot you're in.</p>, <p>Also, with regard to the power grid: You know, you have seen more than most people—in California, you've seen the impact that weather has on not being able to sustain the security of the power grid——</p>, <p><i>Mayor Dyer.</i> Right.</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>——whether it was bad weather or fires or whatever it is. And there's a lot of money in here—a lot of money in here—for making sure we can take care of the lines that carry the electricity, the lines that move it along.</p>, <p>And one of the other pieces in here that I know you know about because you're already doing it, is that—you know, your airport—your airport, as well as the high-speed rail terminal. That also—there's money in here for airports. Republicans strongly supported it, as well as Democrats, because there's a lot that has to be done to modernize the airports. And that also has the impact of cutting down on air quality problems and the like.</p>, <p>And so there's so much. And I understand you have seven more electric buses on order or you're thinking about getting another seven. We've got some money for you.</p>, <p><i>Mayor Dyer.</i> Yes, we have——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> We've got some money for you. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Mayor Dyer.</i> Well, thank you, Mr. President. We actually have seven more that are going to be coming on line in 2022. So—and if you want to send us more, we'll take them.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, by the way, it is really a big, big deal. And one of the things we're doing is, we have provisions that we're trying to encourage the American manufacturers to actually generate and build the platforms for these electric buses.</p>, <p>I was in Carolina looking at a factory where they're making not only school buses, but also, you know, the regular transit systems that are electric-based. It's phenomenal what's going on, but we have to make sure we have all the, you know, access to the various pieces of materials and minerals we need to produce them. But it's a big deal.</p>, <p>So I'm going to be coming back to you, and all of you, to get help on making sure we continue to make these investments because I view this as just starting, not the end. But this is going to play out over the next 8 years—these investments. It's a lot of money. It's over $500 million—billion in new money over those 8 years. And it's paid for. It's paid for.</p>, <p>So thanks for what you're doing. And you know, I always joke with my friends: You know, being a mayor maybe is the toughest job in American politics; they know where you live—[<i>laughter</i>]—and you affect their everyday lives more than anybody. So I wish you the best of luck.</p>, <p><i>Mayor Dyer.</i> Thank you, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Mayor Lumumba, from Jackson, Mississippi. How you doing, pal? Good to see you again. Thanks for being so nice to my wife. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba of Jackson, MS.</i> Thank you, Mr. President. It's a pleasure to join you. It's a pleasure to join all of the amazing people on this call today.</p>, <p>I want to express my gratitude not only to your administration, but towards the bipartisan effort that has led to this bill passing the Senate.</p>, <p>I want to thank Roger—Senator Roger Wicker——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Mayor Lumumba. </i>——from Mississippi——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> He stepped up.</p>, <p><i>Mayor Lumumba. </i>——who stepped up and supported this effort.</p>, <p>Mr. President, as you are well aware, the residents of Jackson, who I have the honor to serve, are greater than the sum of their challenges. And the city of Jackson is greater than the sum of its challenges, with amazing people and with a city which is pregnant with possibilities. But we do have real challenges, which were reflected in our February storms, the consecutive storms that we faced, that completely debilitated our water distribution system. These are challenges we have seen frequently and were reflected in a different fashion most recently in February.</p>, <p>[<i>Mayor Lumumba continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>And so I want to, once again, express my gratitude for your hard work, your focus on this issue. When I met you during your campaign in Atlanta, Georgia, you stated that this would be a focus of yours, and I'm thankful for you holding true to that promise.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, Mr. Mayor, thank you. You know, I think it's important that the other sixteen- or seventeen hundred people who are on this call understand what you and others have gone through. You found yourself in a position, in terms of water, where—it's estimated by our team that over the next 20 years, Mississippi drinking water infrastructure—Mississippi drinking water infrastructure is going to require $4.8 billion in additional funding.</p>, <p>And the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act includes $55 billion in investment to ensure clean, safe drinking water. And it's a right of all communities, as you point out. And the bill would eliminate the Nation's lead-based service lines, which I know you and I talked about. And so there's a lot of good that's going on in here.</p>, <p>And I say to Mayor Dryer [Dyer]* as well that—we talk about, you know, the poverty rate of these towns—you know, we're going to be able to have—all of you have full-blown internet that's affordable and available in rural and cities across the way that's going to change the circumstance for people in those communities that—particularly, those folks—so people don't have to—when they're, God forbid, we're back to having, you know, distanced learning, where they don't have to sit in the McDonald's parking lot to get access—with their mom or dad—to get access to the internet to do their work.</p>, <p>So I just can't thank you enough. You've really gone out of the way to deal with the issues that we're talking about here. And I think—I hope you're going to see a lot of benefit flow from this. Because the idea, you know, no more Flints, no more Jacksons, in terms of water, because we're going to get this done with—as my grandfather used to say, ""with the grace of God and the good will of the neighbors.""</p>, <p>But we've got, also, the entire United States Senate supporting it by 69 votes. And we're looking forward to it happening in the House as well. So thanks a lot, pal. And let us know what you need in this if you're—if—any of you, if you, you know—if any of it comes across as confusing.</p>, <p>Now, I know Liz Hausmann of Fulton County—county commissioner—isn't going to be confused about anything. But I—you know, I—Liz, I made a mistake saying that being a mayor is the toughest; maybe being a county commissioner is. You know why? Because you knock on a door and say, ""My name is Joe Biden, candidate for the county council."" And they'll look at you and smile and say, ""Yes."" And you know what they're thinking: ""What do you do? What does a commissioner do?"" [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Anyway, you have a hell of a job, Liz, and so why don't you tell me what you—what's on your mind. And I know you take—do you take in a lot of Atlanta in your district?</p>, <p><i>Fulton County, GA, Commissioner Liz Hausmann.</i> Atlanta is in our county. Yes, sir.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Commissioner Hausmann.</i> We have 15 cities, including Atlanta.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. Well, fire away. The floor is yours.</p>, <p><i>Commissioner Hausmann.</i> Well, Mr. President, first of all, it's an honor to serve the citizens of Fulton County, but it's a true honor to be here with you today as we have this important conversation about the future and improving our Nation's infrastructure. So thank you for having me.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Commissioner Hausmann.</i> I'm coming from the State of Georgia, which provides—which prides itself in being the number-one State in the Nation to do business. Along with that, of course, comes heavy traffic and congestion.</p>, <p>[<i>Commissioner Hausmann continued her remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>So we've long suffered with local governments being the—required to fund what really is a regional problem.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Commissioner Hausmann.</i> The reality is, each county is limited to funding projects within our county borders. And our authority may stop at the county border, but our transportation needs do not.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Absolutely.</p>, <p><i>Commissioner Hausmann.</i> So we can't do it without the support and partnership of our State and Federal Government. And this bipartisan infrastructure package will help us do just that. So thank you very much.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, thank you. Look, what usually is—I know all of you understand this—and the other over a thousand people on this call understand—local officials—is that when you talk about the commute times and public transportation, you know, the—in Georgia, public transportation spends an extra—those on public transportation spend an extra 74.1 percent of their time commuting. And nonwhite households are 3.9 times more likely to commute on public transportation.</p>, <p>Seven percent of the trains and other transit vehicles in the State are past their useful life. And based on the formula funding alone, Georgia would expect to get $1.4 billion over the next 5 years—a significant portion of which would be in your county—under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to improve public transportation across the State.</p>, <p>When you spend that much time commuting—all of you know this—it costs taxpayers—it cost those commuters a lot of money. For example, the average Georgia driver, on average, spends $375 a year in costs due to driving on roads that need to be repaired.</p>, <p>You have a circumstance in your State where 374 bridges and over two thousand six—260 miles of highway are in poor condition. So it all comes down to being able to move and move without creating additional pollution and generating the ability to move safely and do it in a way that will significantly increase business opportunities and the like.</p>, <p>So I—having been a county official myself, I know that it's hard to convince people of that, because you overlap cities and towns and the like, that, you know, it all affects you; you don't have it all. So thank you for your support. And I think it's going to be very helpful, I hope.</p>, <p><i>Commissioner Hausmann.</i> Thank you. I'm glad to hear you've got Georgia on your mind, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, I do, for more than one reason. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Look, I finally want to turn to Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin, Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. Principal Chief Hoskin, your administration has invested millions of dollars to bring high-speed internet to Cherokee Nation, especially rural Cherokee communities. How will the additional Tribal broadband resources support your Tribal citizens? Or whatever else you want to talk about. But it seems to me that ought to be—that should be of significant help to you, I hope.</p>, <p><i>Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin, Jr., of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma.</i> It is. Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor to be with you and with all the leaders on this panel.</p>, <p>This bill is important for the country. But I want you to know that the bill is important to me because you didn't forget Indian Country. This bill, overall, has more than $11 billion in investment in Indian Country. That is historic, potentially transformational investment for Tribes across this country. That's very important.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Indian nations. Indian nations.</p>, <p><i>Principal Chief Hoskin.</i> Indian nations across this country, working as sovereigns with the United States.</p>, <p>[<i>Principal Chief Hoskin continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>So we are applying for the Tribal Broadband Connectivity grant through the United States Department of Commerce, the National Telecommunications——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Principal Chief Hoskin. </i>——and Information Administration. What this bill does is, it injects $2 billion—more dollars into that program. It extends the life of the program by 4 years.</p>, <p>[<i>Principal Chief Hoskin continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>We couldn't have done it without our Federal partners. We're certainly proud of our leadership. We couldn't do it without this bill, I'm confident. And you have my great appreciation and admiration for that.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, you have my appreciation. You don't owe me anything or nothing to appreciate. This is what we used to do when I first got to the Senate. We—you know, we actually worked with one another.</p>, <p>And look, one of the things that affects Tribal lands, in my experience—not just Cherokee, but across the board—is that they're significantly at risk for the effects of climate change. And infrastructure investments that we're talking about here is going to invest in everything from forest management, to helping communities build resilience, to wildfires and floods, and everything from elevating buildings to roads to bridges. Because it's—we have to build back to where we know the minimum requirements are now, and we've got to do it better.</p>, <p>You can't build back to what it used to be. You used to be able to build back a road to what it was before it got flooded out, before—you can't do that anymore because the climate has changed so significantly already, and so you have to elevate. You have to move.</p>, <p>You see what's happening on—at least in the East Coast, from Florida up to where I live in Delaware and beyond, along the coast. You see the effects of the rising seas and buildings literally sinking or tilting and losing their ability to stand.</p>, <p>I mean, it's a big deal, the things that are changing. And so—and I think it's particularly, you know, important in Tribal lands: elevating buildings, roads, bridges, winterizing the power grid, and the like. And so there's a lot to do that benefits everybody.</p>, <p>You know, one of the points I want to make—and I'll get off my soapbox here—but you know, my observation of my years in public life have been that when ordinary folks do well, everybody does well. Everybody does well. The wealthy do very well. The upper middle class do very well. The middle class—I mean it sincerely. When it works from the middle out and the bottom up, everybody does well.</p>, <p>And there's all kinds of studies from the great universities in your States demonstrating that that is the case. And so this is what this is about.</p>, <p>And I think we have a real chance to deliver everything from clean drinking water, to access to Internets, to roads that are not congested, to dealing with the—I was up in—I think it was Wisconsin, and I was talking to a group of folks in a factory. And then I spoke afterwards, and they showed me around. And there were about a couple hundred people. And in front of me, in this factory floor, were the elected officials—the Governor and other folks—and to my right were all the folks, both the hourly workers and the management.</p>, <p>And I talked about this having safety provisions in it. And they all looked at me like, ""What the hell does that mean?"" And I said, ""I'll bet every one of you can name for me the intersections in your town, in your city where the highest accident rate is, where the most pedestrians are hit, where bicyclists get killed, where there's accidents.</p>, <p>And in unison—not a joke—if there were 120 people there, 100 of them started shaking their heads, ""Yes, we know."" This does a lot of practical things—a lot of practical things—to change the environment that people live in. So I—and there's a lot more to do. I know. And we still have to get it through the House and get things moving.</p>, <p>But I want to thank you all for your time, your insight, and your continued leadership. And I want to thank you for—we're closer than we've ever been in a long time to making a once-in-a-generation investment. You know, this total investment in roads, in highways is bigger than we did in the—Eisenhower's, you know, Interstate Highway System. You know, this is—the only analogies out there and the vote to get it are similar.</p>, <p>Our—you know, we started off with, you know, the Erie Canal. We started off with moving people west. We started off the intercontinental railroad in the late 1800s. All kidding aside, we linked the coasts. Now we came along and we did—and we had the—all the way up to Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System. It has literally changed the way Americans live, changed the way we live and the way we've developed.</p>, <p>And now we're investing as much money or more money to do those kinds of things that can make us better connected and also give us more breathing room and clean the air a little bit. So I want to thank you all because almost all of you—I think all of you signed on to the bipartisan effort of mayors and—as well as other State and county officials to support this.</p>, <p>And I promise you, we're going to stay on top of making sure, as long as I'm here, that it gets out, it gets out swiftly, and it gets out economically, and it gets out in a way that builds this country.</p>, <p>And I know I got criticized when I was running. Said—I said I was running for three reasons: one, to restore the soul of the country; two, to rebuild the backbone—the middle class and working class people—of this country, and not leave them behind; and thirdly, to unite the country.</p>, <p>I know a lot of people were skeptical, but we can do this. We can do this. We're going to disagree in philosophy on some of the things, but we can do this. I'm convinced we can.</p>, <p>And by the way, I'm going to say something that has no direct bearing on—immediate bearing on what any of you are dealing with. But you know, when I was over in the NATO conference; or I was over for the G-7, with the largest industrial nations in the world; and when I was at a, you know, summit with Putin—and I'm about to go do the same thing, in terms of the G-20—you know what affects our—the attitude of the rest of the world about the United States? ""Can we still do—get things done?"" Not a joke. Not a joke.</p>, <p>When I went over, I said—with those seven leaders, I said, ""We're back."" And the response was: ""For how long? For how long? You guys can't get anything done.""</p>, <p>I'll conclude by saying that, you know, when I won—just because of my Irish background, heritage—they were ringing bells in Ireland and painting my picture on the side of buildings and the like. But the Taoiseach of Ireland—the Prime Minister of Ireland—said something just before I got sworn in that made a lot of sense. He said: ""I think I'm—I'm not sure what America can do anymore. They can't even deal with COVID. They can't lead anymore."" That's what the world is looking at us; they're wondering.</p>, <p>And you've got guys like Xi Jinping and Putin who think the answer is autocracy, because democracies can't get together. The world is changing so rapidly—so rapidly. We can't get together and answer the big, tough questions.</p>, <p>I really mean it. I'm not joking. I promise you, this is what your children and grandchildren are going to be writing about in their senior thesis and graduate school. And we've got to make sure we can demonstrate we can get things done. And it can't be done by one party.</p>, <p>So thank you all so very, very, very much. And as I said, as my grandpop would say, ""With the grace of God, the good will of the neighbors, and the creek not rising, we're going to get all this done.""</p>, <p>And I hope you all take a look at my Build Back Better plan that has to do with a lot of other pieces that are—that the Senate just agreed to move forward on. You may not agree, but take a look at it and see if any of it has a value to your communities. Okay?</p>, <p>Thanks, everybody. I really do appreciate it. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>, <p><i>Mayor Dyer.</i> Thank you, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Whitmer.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Public Debt Limit </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Are you worried about the debt ceiling, Mr. President?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Nope. They're not going to let us default.</p>]"
12,8,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation and Education and Family Assistance Legislation,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-infrastructure-and-jobs-legislation-and-education-and-family-assistance-0,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good afternoon. Last week, we had good news on job growth: 943,000 jobs created in July—the seventh largest month of job creation in U.S. history—making the administration the first ever to add 4 million jobs in the first 6 months in office.</p>, <p>And then, in the past 24 hours, we've seen the Senate advance two key pieces of my economic agenda: the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the budget resolution that is the framework for my Build Back Better plan.</p>, <p>Today I'm pleased to share more good news with the American people: The latest report on consumer price shows—prices show that we've expanded some easing—excuse me, the expected easing we thought was going to come has increased—that we are—we've seen a good monthly report.</p>, <p>The monthly core consumer price index is down by nearly two thirds from its pace over the past 3 months. And when you take out the goods directly impacted by the pandemic, like cars and airplane tickets and month—the monthly core consumer price index has—is less than two-tenths of 1 percent.</p>, <p>So here's where we stand: Jobs are up, and monthly price increases have come down. Economic growth is up to the fastest in 40 years, and unemployment is coming down. So I would argue, our—the Biden economic plan is working. And historic investments are on the way as well.</p>, <p>This isn't accidental. It is the result of our strategy to get shots in arms, grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. And it's the rest of the—the result of the American Rescue Plan and everything else that we've done. And it's a result of the grit and determination and really hard work of the American people.</p>, <p>But even with all this progress, a lot of families are still feeling the pinch. Family budgets remain tight, and paychecks don't go as far as they need to. That has been a reality in the millions of households all across America for too long.</p>, <p>That's why I want to talk today about what we're going to do to try to ease the burden on families right now and what we need to do to help them succeed over the longer term.</p>, <p>First, for millions of families, help is on the way right now, thanks to the American Rescue Plan. On Friday, about 40 million families will receive their second monthly payment as part of our tax cut for families with children: three hundred and—$300 for each child under the age of 6 and $250 for every child 6 through the age of 17. That's money for diapers, food, rent, school supplies, fees and equipment for a child to join sports teams and dance class. Most of all, as my dad used to say, it just gives a parent a little bit of breathing room.</p>, <p>The money is a game changer. And so I would argue, for some, it's literally a lifesaver. Economists also tell us that those kinds of tax cuts boost test scores, college attendance, and lifetime earnings for children, a win-win. And that's why I'm glad that, early this morning, Congress took an important step to make sure that this tax cut for families with children does not expire next year. So let's keep this tax cut going and not raise taxes on middle class families.</p>, <p>The second point I'd like to make is, we're talking about taking action that alleviates global supply chain challenges that keep prices higher than they should be. For example, we're tracking congestion at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach—the largest ports in the United States—where increased shipping traffic and the challenges of operating safely in a pandemic are creating disruptions. Those disruptions impact everything from how much our food costs to when deliveries arrive.</p>, <p>So my administration is bringing together the port operators, shipping lines, the labor unions, trucking companies, railroads, and others to speed up the ports' operations. Right now our experts believe—the major independent forecasters agree as well—that these bottlenecks and price spikes will reduce as our economy continues to heal.</p>, <p>And while today's consumer price report points in that direction, we will keep a careful eye on inflation each month, and trust the Fed to take appropriate action if and when it's needed.</p>, <p>Third, I've directed my administration to crack down on what some major players are doing in the economy that are keeping prices higher than they need be.</p>, <p>Take your groceries bill: When big agriculture operations consolidate, they put a squeeze on small and family farms, making them pay more for seed, paying them less for what they produce, and raising prices on what your groceries—what you pay for your groceries at the grocery store. My Executive order opens up competition in the agricultural business, gives more farmers a chance to compete, which will give Americans more food choices at lower cost.</p>, <p>Fourthly, we are taking action to address gas prices as well. Today, gas prices are lower than they were early in this decade. But they're still high enough to create a pinch on working families.</p>, <p>One key thing about the infrastructure bill that just passed the Senate is there are no gas tax increases. No gas tax increases. I made that absolutely clear that I would not raise gas taxes, and I'm glad everyone in the Senate seemed to agree with that. But that's not enough.</p>, <p>Recently, we've seen the price that oil companies pay for a barrel of oil begin to fall, but the cost of gasolines at the pump for more American people hasn't fallen. That's not what you'd expect in a competitive market.</p>, <p>I want to make sure that nothing stands in the way of oil price declines, leading to lower prices for consumers. So today my Director of the Economic—the National Economic Council has asked the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission to use every available tool to monitor the U.S. gasoline market and address any illegal conduct that might be conduct that might be contributing to price increases at the pump while the cost of barrel oil is going down.</p>, <p>We also made clear to OPEC—the major oil-exporting nations of the world—that the production cuts made during the pandemic should be reversed as the global economic—there as the global economy recovers, in order to lower the prices for consumers.</p>, <p>The child tax credit, stepping in to address the supply chain challenges, my competition order, the FTC investigation into price gouging—these are some of the immediate steps we are taking to put more money in your pocket and make that money go further.</p>, <p>But we also need to do more to bring down the costs that are squeezing families month after month and year after year. We need to make this economy work better for working families in the long run.</p>, <p>These challenges were with us long before the pandemic and before I took office. But as we recover from this crisis, now is the moment to put in place the long-term plan to build back America better, a plan that will increase opportunities with better jobs and with higher wages, a plan that will lower the everyday costs that strain our budgets and our Nation's families today and long into the future.</p>, <p>It starts with making investments that we know will make the economy more productive and lead to more growth over the long run.</p>, <p>Bringing down the costs—everyday costs that have been taking a bigger and bigger bite out of middle class families' incomes—the expenses that parents—that keep parents up at night and rob seniors of their dignity: health care, prescription drug costs, childcare, education, housing, or caring for an elderly relative or a loved one.</p>, <p>For those who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, the American Rescue Plan allowed us to cover more people at lower premiums and lower premiums by an average of 40 percent. In my Build Back Better plan, we want to build on that progress.</p>, <p>Or prescription drugs. Right now we pay the highest prescription drug cost prices of any developed nation in the world—the highest. My Build Back Better plan is going to lower prescription drug costs by finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate the prices of drug they purchase for the American people, saving Americans hundreds of billions of dollars. On top of that, my plan would add hearing, dental, and vision benefits to Medicare.</p>, <p>Right now there are hundreds of thousands of Americans who need home- and community-based care services. My plan expands homecare for older Americans and people with disabilities while improving jobs and the pay for the workers who care for them.</p>, <p>My plan will also provide access to quality, affordable childcare, with new and upgraded childcare facilities all across the country. Middle class families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for highly qualified care for children up to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families will not pay a dime.</p>, <p>Today my Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of Management and Budget released a report showing clearly how my Build Back Better plan will lower out-of-pocket expenses for families.</p>, <p>For example, a family with two parents who together earn $85,000 per year. They have an adult daughter who lives with them and attends a community college. They care for an elderly parent who needs arthritis medicine, which costs $5,500 out-of-pocket each year, an eye exam to get a new pair of glasses.</p>, <p>Under our Build Back Better plan, their daughter would be eligible for 2 years of community college free. That will save them $2,400 a year. That's like a $2,400 tax credit. In addition—and I should say ""tax cut,"" not just ""credit."" In addition, my plan would cap out-of-pocket expenses and costs for their mom's and dad's prescription drugs, saving that family another $2,400 a year.</p>, <p>And this new vision—and the new vision benefit under Medicare would pay for that eye exam and new glasses and lenses, saving $450 a year. All told, my plan would save that family making $85,000 a year $5,250.</p>, <p>And the Build Back Better plan is going to save your family a lot as well.</p>, <p>Now, there are a number of—there's been a lot of misleading talk—which is no surprise, I guess—about what I'm proposing in my Build Back Better agenda. It's not a short-term stimulus, it's a long-term investment in American families.</p>, <p>My Republican colleagues have argued that long-term investments in physical infrastructure will grow the economy and reduce inflationary pressures. And I thank them for that. They're exactly right. We agree on that.</p>, <p>And the same time, it's true that long-term investments that bring down the biggest costs that families face—housing, childcare, education, and health care—these investments will lower out-of-pocket expenses, not raise them. They will spur more people to work by helping ease the burdens of childcare and senior care that parents, especially mothers, bear, keeping them out of the job market.</p>, <p>And they'll spread out over the decade. They'll make a huge difference for families, but they'll only make up around 1 percent of our economy's each—of our economy each year over the next decade. And they're going to be fully paid for.</p>, <p>This isn't going to be anything like my predecessor, whose unpaid tax cuts and other spending added nearly $8 trillion in his 4 years to the national debt. Eight trillion dollars. They didn't even purport to try to pay for their tax cuts, which went straight to the largest corporations and the wealthiest Americans.</p>, <p>The investments I am proposing will be fully paid for over the long term by having the largest corporations, including the 55 corporations that paid zero Federal tax last year, and the superwealthy begin to pay their fair share. They'll still make a lot of money, but pay their fair share. That means it will actually reduce the national debt, improve our fiscal position over the long run.</p>, <p>My Build Back Better agenda is fiscally responsible—the fiscally responsible way to reduce the costs for families. In fact, you're hearing economists across the board confirm this. Moody's has said that, quote, ""worries that the plan will ignite""—and this is Moody's now—""will ignite undesirably high inflation and an overheating economy [is] overdone.""</p>, <p>Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said of my plan, and I quote, ""There is no conceivable way that they [will] have any significant effect on inflation."" Jason Furman of Harvard University has said, quote, ""I don't think the infrastructure bill or reconciliation plan would materially impact inflation over the next decade.""</p>, <p>So, if your primary concern right now is the cost of living, you should support this plan, not oppose it. Because a vote against this plan is a vote against lowering the cost of health care, housing, childcare, eldercare, and prescription drugs for American families.</p>, <p>So let me close with this: We've brought this economy back from a cold start. And there is going to be—there are going to be some ups and downs. But I am committed to making sure that our historic economic recovery reaches everyone—this time, it reaches everyone—and eases the burden on working families not just this year, but for the years to come.</p>, <p>So thank you, God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, one on Afghanistan, sir?</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, are you calling on companies to mandate vaccines?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Is the CPI report so good, do you think—[<i>inaudible</i>]?</p>]"
12,9,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks Prior to a Briefing From Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Bennett Criswell, Homeland Security, and COVID-19 Response Teams",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-briefing-from-federal-emergency-management-agency-administrator-deanne,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Hey, folks. I'll make a brief opening statement here. I want to thank you, Administrator Criswell, for the job you've been doing and outstanding work helping our country navigate what is overlapping challenges we've been facing. And you've been very busy.</p>, <p>We've got wildfires in the West. We've got—approaching the peak of Atlantic hurricane season. All across the country, the Delta variant is spreading, as Dr. Fauci and others can tell you, and it's spreading rapidly—rapidly among the unvaccinated. When these crises intersect, they compound one another—natural disasters and the Delta variant.</p>, <p>And that's what we're going to be discussing today with the group I've assembled here. We need to be ready to manage our natural disasters caused by hurricanes hitting the Southeast and the environment and with a broad community spread of COVID-19. And the best thing we can do is—to prepare for that is to—for everyone who is not vaccinated—I know it's a broken record, and I keep saying it—but to get vaccinated.</p>, <p>With the Delta variant, we're seeing a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Cases and hospitalizations are rising faster in States with low vaccination rates, such as Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi, which are the States that—from a hurricane-prone—they're the States that are most at risk.</p>, <p>And so we don't wait until it's too late. And if God forbid, a natural disaster strikes, we have to make sure we're ready to be protected against COVID-19 as well.</p>, <p>Let me be clear: If you're in a State where hurricanes often strike—like Florida or the Gulf Coast or into Texas—a vital part of preparing for hurricane season is to get vaccinated now. Everything is more complicated if you're not vaccinated and a hurricane or a natural disaster hits.</p>, <p>If you wind up having to evacuate, if you wind up having to stay in a shelter, you don't want to add COVID-19 to the list of dangers that you're going to be confronting. Get vaccinated now so you're ready for whatever may come this month. And it's likely some serious hurricanes are going to come this month.</p>, <p>So go to ready.gov to make sure that you're prepared with the hurricane—with a hurricane plan. Know your evacuation zones. Have a plan with your family. And get your emergency supplies and a go-bag ready, and don't forget to pack one for your pets as well. I mean that seriously.</p>, <p>And if you've got older neighbors or people in your community who might need your help, check in to see if you can help them make a plan as well.</p>, <p>And the bottom line is this: The more we do to prepare, the better off we are when disaster strikes. We can't prevent hurricanes making landfall, but we can prevent people from getting seriously sick and dying from COVID-19. Get vaccinated and make a plan.</p>, <p>Thank you all. That's what we're going to discuss in some detail today with my team. Thank you all very much.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Sir, your message to—[<i>inaudible</i>]?</p>]"
13,0,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on Senate Passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-senate-passage-the-infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-and-exchange-with,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Well, thank you, Madam Vice President. First of all, I want to thank the group of Senators—Democrats and Republicans—for doing what they told me they would do. The death of this legislation was mildly premature, as reported. They said they were willing to work in a bipartisan manner, and I want to thank them for keeping their word. That's just what they did.</p>, <p>After years and years and years of ""Infrastructure Week,"" we're on the cusp of an infrastructure decade that I truly believe will transform America. As you all know, just a short while ago, the United States Senate passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act—the very legislation I ran on when I announced my candidacy for the nomination for President—a historic investment in the Nation's roads and highways, bridges and transit; in our drinking water systems; in broadband, clean energy, environmental cleanup; and making infrastructure more resilient and the climate crisis much more in our minds as to how do we deal with it.</p>, <p>You know, we're poised once again—and I mean this in a literal sense—to make the same kind of historic investments that have so often made possible—made it possible for America to build the future and allow us to outcompete the rest of the world.</p>, <p>From building the Erie Canal in the early 1800s—a bipartisan effort; to the transcontinental railroad, to construction—that was constructed during the Civil War; to Dwight Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System in 1950s—the investments that literally connected our entire Nation and fundamentally changed the pattern of life in America.</p>, <p>To the public investments that took us to the Moon and the discovery of lifesaving medicines and vaccines and gave us the internet, America has often had the greatest prosperity and made the most progress when we invest in America itself.</p>, <p>And that's what this infrastructure bill does with overwhelming support from the United States Senate—69 votes in the Senate—a vote margin bigger than when the Interstate Highway System passed in the Senate in 1956. It makes key investments that will, one, create millions of good union jobs all across the country in cities, small towns, rural and Tribal communities.</p>, <p>America—America—this is how we truly Build Back Better. This bill is going to put people to work modernizing our roads and our highways and our bridges so commuters and truckers don't lose time in traffic, saving billions of dollars nationally.</p>, <p>Today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and schools—and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them, including for drinking water. This is a clear and present danger to the health of America, particularly to our children's health. This bill is going to put plumbers and pipefitters to work replacing all of the Nation's lead pipes so every child, every American can turn on a faucet at home or in school and know they're drinking clean water.</p>, <p>During remote learning in the—during the pandemic last year, we saw too many families forced to sit—literally sit—in their vehicles in a fast food parking lot so their children could get on the internet they couldn't afford and didn't have access to at home. This bill will deliver affordable, high-speed internet to every American, a necessity for the 21st century.</p>, <p>We'll also see in the last—we've seen in the last couple of years the damage done in Texas and other places when transmission lines carrying power were taken down by extreme and unanticipated weather, leaving millions of folks without electricity for weeks and weeks and costing our economy billions and billions of dollars. This bill provides upgrades to our power grid so that more secure and resilient and cleaner energy can be transferred across those wires.</p>, <p>Down in New Orleans, I met with the incredible women and men who are in charge of the water system, some of it running on technology that is literally 100 years old. This bill is going to provide opportunities to upgrade their system.</p>, <p>It also allows American workers to strengthen our national—our natural infrastructure, like our levees. These are at risk of catastrophic collapse in the face of extreme weather like superstorms, wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, and heat waves.</p>, <p>Last week, I stood—and many of you were with me—on the South Lawn of the White House with the United Auto Workers and with leaders from the Big Three automobile companies in America, surrounded by iconic American vehicles that will all be electric and made right here in America in the not-too-distant future.</p>, <p>This bill is also going to put IBEW workers—electrical workers—to work installing a truly national network of electric vehicle charging stations that will transform the way we travel and move commerce. And by the way, around those charging stations, you'll see—just like around—we put in gas stations in our State highways—you'll see other industries build up. We have the benefit of significantly reducing pollution from vehicles on our roads.</p>, <p>Look, this bill, I believe, will make the most important investment in public transit in American history. When I went to Philadelphia not too long ago for Amtrak's 50th anniversary, I was proud to be able to say that this bill was in the works and that it would be the most important investment in rail since the creation of Amtrak itself. This bill will upgrade railroad tracks so people can get to work and their destinations faster, and it will build new lines to get people to more places faster, reducing, I might add, pollution, as well.</p>, <p>And here's another critical part of the bill: 90 percent of the jobs created don't require a college degree. You're tired of hearing me saying it, I know, but this is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America.</p>, <p>We're going to do all of this by keeping my commitment. We will not raise taxes by one cent on people making less than $400,000 a year.</p>, <p>Everyone from union to business leaders to economists—left, right, and center—believe the public investments contained in this bill will generate more jobs, higher productivity, higher growth for our economy over the long term.</p>, <p>Forecasters on Wall Street project that over the next 10 years our economy will expand by trillions of dollars, and it will create an additional 2 million jobs a year beyond what was already projected, good-paying jobs all around the country.</p>, <p>Experts believe that the majority of the bill's benefits will flow to working families: faster commutes, cleaner water, less expense, available and affordable internet. These are the things that working families needs—that they need.</p>, <p>As last week's jobs report shows, our economy is recovering at a record rate, 934,000 new jobs created in July. It's going to go up and down, but 4 million jobs created since I took office. This bill is going to help make a historic recovery a long-term boom.</p>, <p>Folks, above all, this historic investment in infrastructure is what I believe you, the American people, want, what you've been asking for for a long, long time. This bill shows that we can work together.</p>, <p>I know a lot of people—some sitting in the audience here—didn't think this could happen. This bill was declared dead more often than—anyway. That bipartisanship was a thing of the past. From the time I announced my candidacy—[<i>inaudible</i>]—bringing the country together and doing things in a bipartisan way, it was characterized as a relic of an earlier age. As you may well remember, I never believed that. I still don't.</p>, <p>So I want to thank those Senators who worked so hard to bring this agreement together. I know it wasn't easy. For the Republicans who supported this bill, you showed a lot of courage. And I want to personally thank you for that, and I've called most of you on the phone to do just that.</p>, <p>You have—and no doubt, you will—disagree with me on many issues. But where we can agree, we should. And here, on this bill, we proved that we can still come together to do big things, important things for the American people.</p>, <p>For the Democrats who supported this bill, we can be proud of this, unprecedented investments that are going to transform this Nation and change millions of lives for the better.</p>, <p>Think about what's going to happen, in a practical sense. Clogged arteries at the heart of our economy—they're going to be opened up. That will reduce transportation costs, reduce commuting costs, and as a result, reduce costs overall for families and businesses.</p>, <p>And there's safety provisions being—as I said not long ago, everyone can tell you what the most dangerous intersections in their communities are. There's money in there to deal with those specific needs. Thousands of bridges will be safer and more accessible.</p>, <p>And by the way, as you've heard me say before, some bridges are so weak that they couldn't have a firetruck go across it, requiring the fire department to go 10, 12 miles out of the way to get just, literally, a mile away to put out a fire.</p>, <p>Millions of lead pipes carrying drinking water to our homes and schools and daycare centers—they're finally going to replaced—be replaced. Never again can we allow what happened in Flint, Michigan; and Jackson, Mississippi. Can never let it happen again.</p>, <p>High-speed internet, going to be available and affordable everywhere, to everyone, so farmers nationwide can get the best prices for their products at home and abroad by knowing when to sell and children in Chicago or Philadelphia never have to again sit in a McDonald's parking lot to do their homework.</p>, <p>This is transformational. I know compromise is hard for both sides, but it's important—it's important, it's necessary—for a democracy to be able to function. So I want to thank everyone on both sides of the aisle for supporting this bill. Today we proved that democracy can still work. A lot more work to do. But I want to thank the Republican—Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell for supporting this bill. And I want to give special thanks to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Your leadership, Chuck, in the Senate was masterful.</p>, <p>But look, let's be clear: The work is far from done. The bill now has to go the House of Representatives, where I look forward to winning its approval.</p>, <p>And we have to get to work on the next critical piece of my agenda, my Build Back Better plan: making housing more affordable—it's so unaffordable to so many Americans; providing clean energy tax cuts, including homeowners to make energy efficiency improvements in their homes; bringing down the cost of prescription drugs; making eldercare more affordable; and continuing to give middle class families with children a tax break—a tax cut—the one they're receiving now, well-deserved childcare and health care that gives them just a little bit of breathing room.</p>, <p>This is a plan that invests in the American people—in their future and their success. And it will be paid for by having the largest corporations—including 55 of them who didn't pay a single penny in Federal income tax—and the superwealthy to begin to pay their fair share.</p>, <p>I want you to be able to be millionaires and corporations to do incredibly well, but this isn't going to change anything for you. You'll still have your three homes. You'll still have whatever you need. And corporations will continue to do well.</p>, <p>I'll have more to say about this later as the Senate continues its work. But today I'm happy to mark this significant milestone on the road toward making what we all know are long-overdue, much-needed investments in basic, hard infrastructure of this Nation.</p>, <p>I truly believe that this bill proves the voice of the people will be heard and that we can all come together to make a difference in people's lives. As you heard me say it before and I apologize for repeating it, but there are no Republican bridges or Democratic roads.</p>, <p>This is a moment that lives beyond the headlines, beyond partisan soundbites, beyond the culture of instant outrage, disinformation, and conflict-as-entertainment. This is about us doing the real, hard work of governing. This is about democracy delivering for the people. This is about winning the future. It's about doing our job. This is about building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, giving everyone a decent chance at a decent life.</p>, <p>And by the way, when the bottom and middle do well, the wealthy do very, very well. Nobody, nobody, nobody gets hurt. This is what I call governing and government doing its job, ensuring everybody is better off.</p>, <p>As I've said many times, and I'll say it again today: We are the United States of America. And there is nothing—nothing—we can't do if we do it together.</p>, <p>So thank you, God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, Mr. President, your reaction to——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, what is your reaction to Governor Cuomo——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Darlene at AP. Darlene [Darlene Superville, Associated Press] at AP.</p>, <p><i>Governor Andrew M. Cuomo of New York </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Yes, thank you. What is your reaction to Governor Cuomo's—his announcement that he is stepping down? You called on him to resign. Did you think he would?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I respect the Governor's decision, and I respect the decision he made.</p>, <p><i>School Reopening Efforts/Coronavirus Transmission Among Children/Vaccination Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, how concerned are you right now about children in schools, given that 94 percent of children, many of them unable to get vaccinated because they're too young, have now tested positive? What are your concerns, and how concerned are you that schools will not be able to stay open as you've asked for?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> My concerns are deep, and I'm very concerned, and we all know why.</p>, <p>Look, I understand that there are millions of people who decided—adults—who decided not to get vaccinated. And I understand that to badger those folks is not likely to get them to move and get vaccinated. But I also understand that the reason children are becoming infected is because, in most cases, they live in low-vaccination-rate States and communities, and they're getting it from unvaccinated adults. That's what's happening.</p>, <p>And so my plea is that for those who are not vaccinated: Think about it. God willing, the FDA is going to be coming out in a reasonable timeframe to say this vaccine is totally safe. We've seen millions of doses around the world—a billion doses already—and we know how it's transmitted.</p>, <p>And one of the things that I find a little disingenuous: When I suggest that people in zones where there is a high risk wear the masks like you all are doing, I'm told that government should get out of the way and not do that; they don't have the authority to do that.</p>, <p>And I find it interesting that some of the very people who are saying that, who are—hold government positions, are people who are threatening that if a schoolteacher asks a student if they've been vaccinated or if a principal says that, ""Everyone in my school should wear a mask,"" or the schoolboard votes for it, that Governor will nullify that. That Governor has the authority to say, ""You can't do that."" I find that totally counterintuitive and, quite frankly, disingenuous.</p>, <p><i>Presidential Authority/Coronavirus Transmission Among Children </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Do you have the Presidential powers to intervene in States like Texas and Florida where they are banning mask mandates?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I don't believe that I do thus far. We're checking that. We—but there are on—Federal workforce, I can.</p>, <p>And I think that people should understand, seeing little kids—I mean, 4, 5, 6 years old—in hospitals, on ventilators, and some of them passing—not many, but some of them passing—it's almost, I mean, it's just—well, I should not characterize it beyond that.</p>, <p><i>Governor Andrew M. Cuomo of New York </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>On Andrew Cuomo, his resignation: What impact—as the head of the Party, what impact does his resignation have on the Democratic Party?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I think the impact is all on Andrew Cuomo and his decision to make that judgement, and I respect his decision.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Sir, on Afghanistan: In just the last few days, multiple cities in Afghanistan have fallen to the Taliban. There's irrefutable evidence that a vast majority of those Afghan forces cannot hold ground there. Has your current plan to withdraw U.S. troops changed at all?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No. Look, we spent over a trillion dollars over 20 years. We trained and equipped with modern equipment over 300,000 Afghan forces. And Afghan leaders have to come together. We lost thousands—lost to death and injury—thousands of American personnel. They've got to fight for themselves, fight for their nation.</p>, <p>The United States, I'll insist we continue to keep the commitments we made of providing close air support, making sure that their air force functions and is operable, resupplying their forces with food and equipment and paying all their salaries. But they've got to want to fight. They have outnumbered the Taliban.</p>, <p>And I'm getting daily briefings. I think there's still a possibility—you have a significant new Secretary of Defense—our equivalent of a Secretary of Defense in Afghanistan, Bismillah Khan, who is a serious fighter. I think they're beginning to realize they've got to come together politically at the top and—but we're going to continue to keep our commitment. But I do not regret my decision.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> To this side. Yes, ma'am.</p>, <p><i>Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act/Budget Reconciliation Process </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, on the issue of the infrastructure bill and the work that you have ahead of you now, are you concerned that you—are you confident that you have the support of all the Democrats on board to get this $3.5 trillion package through? I keep asking you that.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I know you do. As my mother would say, ""God love you, dear.""</p>, <p>Look, I have, as I said—and I'm not referring to you, in particular, just overall. I was going over some of the quotes from the moment that I got elected how my plan was ""dead."" This is the exact same plan I ran on.</p>, <p>We'll see. I continue to be an optimist. As I told you, I was once referred to by a doctor as a ""congenital optimist."" I think that we can get a significant portion of the—if not all—of the reconciliation bill, the budget—they're doing—they're having the vote-a-thon now.</p>, <p>I think, over the next month, which is the way it's going to work, they vote on all of these amendments, and then they get to the business of seeing how they can make it work and then come back—I know you understand this well, but the public wonders what we're talking about sometimes—and decide exactly what's in that reconciliation bill and how much is going to be spent.</p>, <p>I think we will get enough Democrats to vote for it, and I think that the House will eventually put two bills on my desk: one on infrastructure, and one on reconciliation.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Can I ask you——</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Delta Variant/Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President—thank you so much, Mr. President. Just sort of turning to the Delta——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, sorry. Go ahead.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Just sort of turning to the Delta variant for a moment, I wanted to see if, in retrospect, you think your administration put enough mitigation measures in place early enough, and whether or not you should've, perhaps, heeded some of the lessons from other countries that had data as early as May and June about how the variant spread?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, we knew how the variant spread, and we know the vaccines prevent the spread. So—[<i>laughter</i>]—it's like—you know, a lot of countries didn't have the vaccines we were able to put together to make sure every single American—we have over 300 million doses—600 million doses of vaccine for Americans. And we've exported over a half a billion—we will over a half a billion.</p>, <p>So we knew—what is disappointing is that more people were not willing to take the vaccine. We've done everything in our power—well, I shouldn't say—there's probably more—we will do more. But we continue to try to make the case to the American people who haven't taken the vaccine that it's in your interest, can save your life, and can fundamentally impact on the lives of your children or people you love.</p>, <p>Now, one of the things that's happening, as bad as things have gotten, the death rate is one-fiftieth—or I don't—don't hold me to the number, but significantly, significantly lower than when the—when I inherited this job—inherited the job—[<i>laughter</i>]—when I inherited the coronavirus pandemic when I first got elected.</p>, <p>So the thing that I—I continue to hope that people will overcome their fears because their fears are based on—some are just as a political statement, but very few. I think most people are worried. And that's why I'm hoping that the FDA will say that we permanently approve of these vaccines, because we have enough for everyone.</p>, <p>And I am hoping that, as people realize—and it is picking up. Vaccines are picking up, but not at the rate they were before. Remember, I was setting up, you know, stadiums—sports stadiums, and we were doing thousands of vaccines a day. And I wish I could have thought of something beyond what we've thought of that would make everybody want to get the vaccine, but that hasn't been the case.</p>, <p>Now, at a Federal level, what I'm going to be doing is more—is making sure that they understand that I do have authority to say, ""If you're going to come into this building—into a Federal building that you have to have been vaccinated or show that, or be wearing a mask.""</p>, <p>And I think that I'm going to use—and I anticipate that it's probable that the Defense Department will—as they put in place all the mechanisms needed to be able to, in fact, impose or initiate a mandate for all the regular forces and reserves to get vaccinated.</p>, <p>But I continue to be hopeful. You see, I had a long talk—not a long—I had a talk with Governor Asa Hutchinson, who said he made a mistake. And he is working really hard, going around. And he told me that he's doing a lot of town meetings, not all of which are being embraced, but he's making the case. We're going to continue to make the case.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>If I may, ironically, one of the——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, I do have a question.</p>, <p><i>Governor Andrew M. Cuomo of New York </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>——one of the Democrats, through the years, that you spoke with about infrastructure the most was Andrew Cuomo, who is resigning—who announced he's resigning today. You had traveled New York with him when you were Vice President to the launch of the reconstruction on LaGuardia. He was someone who supported your campaign early on.</p>, <p>I know you called on him to resign. I know you condemned the alleged behavior. But you're someone who spends a lot of time with mayors and Governors. How would you assess his 10½ years as Governor of the State?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> In terms of his personal behavior or what he's done as a Governor?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>What he's done as a Governor.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, he's done a hell of job. I thought he's done a hell of a job. And, I mean, both on—everything from access to voting, to infrastructure, to a whole range of things. That's why it's so sad.</p>, <p>Okay. Last question. Right here.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Bipartisanship </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Sure. Mr. President, I have a question about the significance of the bipartisan nature of the infrastructure agreement. Are there lessons learned from that agreement that can be applied to voting reform, police reform, or LGBTQ civil rights?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> By you guys or by me? [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>By anyone. By—and——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm sorry, I shouldn't kid, because I was just reading about 50 statements from very serious press people about how I—my whole plan was ""dead"" from the beginning.</p>, <p>Look, the lesson learned is being willing to talk and listen. Listen. Call people in.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, no, let me finish it. And I think the lesson learned is exposing people to other views. And so that's why, from the beginning, on all the subjects you raised, I've sat with people and listened to their positions, some in agreement with where I am and some in disagreement. And so I think it's a matter of listening. It's part of democracy.</p>, <p>Thank you all so very much. Thank you. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Sir, why have you not named an FDA Commissioner, sir, to this point?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Governor Andrew M.

Why have you not yet named an FDA Commissioner, sir?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Say again.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>You haven't named an FDA commissioner yet. I was wondering why you haven't found or named a permanent FDA Commissioner yet.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> We're working on that very hard to make sure we can get it passed.</p>, <p>Yes.</p>, <p><i>Governor Andrew M.

Can you really say that he has done a, quote, ""hell of a job"" if he's accused of sexually harassing women——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Now, look, you asked two different questions.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>——on the job?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> You asked the substantive ""Should he remain as Governor"" as one question.</p>, <p>And you—women should be believed when they make accusations that are able to—on the face of them, makes sense—and investigated—they're investigated and the judgement was made and what they said was correct. That's one thing.</p>, <p>The question is, ""Did he do a good job on infrastructure?"" That was the question. He did.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Well, the question was, ""How did he do as a Governor?"" He was accused of——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, the question was——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>——sexually harassing women.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Correct me if I'm wrong.</p>, <p><i>Governor Andrew M. Cuomo of New York </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>About how was he as a Governor, generally——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, as a Governor, generally, obviously——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>——outside of his personal behavior.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Outside of his personal behavior. Okay. Well——</p>, <p><i>Governor Andrew M. Cuomo of New York </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>But can you separate the two since he was in office—[<i>inaudible</i>]——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I'm not. I was asked a specific question.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Okay, how——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm trying to answer it specifically. What do you want to ask me, specifically?</p>, <p><i>Infrastructure Investment Jobs Act </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Well, I'd like to ask you about infrastructure as well. Given that you have said this is such an urgent bill that needs to be passed, why not have the House take it up immediately for a vote?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] We'll get it done.

13,1,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks Honoring the 2020 United States Olympic Team in Greenville, Delaware",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-honoring-the-2020-united-states-olympic-team-greenville-delaware,"[<p>[<i>The 2020 Summer Olympic Games, originally scheduled to take place in Tokyo, Japan, from July 22 through August 9, 2020, were postponed until July 23, 2021, due to the COVID-19 global pandemic.</i> <i>The President and First Lady spoke via video conference from their residence in Greenville, DE.</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, thank you so very, very much. You know, I know you have a sense of it, but I don't think you'll appreciate until you get home how proud you made America—not just the winning more medals than anyone, and you may end up with as many gold before this is over, as China.</p>, <p>But here's the deal: You really represented America. You represented the soul of the country, whether it was was—I mean, I thought when you were getting knocked down by an—an opponent on track and you back—you stop and then go back and pick him up and walk through the finish line with him—come on. That's what America is supposed to be about. And you represented every single thing that we stand for. You really did.</p>, <p>And I just think that—you know, look, it wasn't just—for a lot of the athletes—a lot of you, it wasn't just your athletic ability; it was your moral courage—the courage you showed, the courage of those who were under real pressure and intellectual—and pressure—psychological pressure and being able to, like what Katie Ledecky—what Ledecky did. She wasn't under the pressure; she just went out and won. She just won everything that was in front of her. And I don't know if she's online—I can't see her—but, Katie, if you're on here, I realize that you can probably swim a mile quicker than most people could run a mile. It's just amazing all—just all you've done.</p>, <p>And you know, when we talk about—all of us—like Simone Biles. I mean, the courage you had to get back up on that beam after—at the very end and still win the bronze. I mean, you showed everything about who we are as a people.</p>, <p>And watching your families—watching your families was as exciting almost as watching you guys. I mean, they were overjoyed. And they were—I mean—and I don't think there's harder Olympics to get ready for. You guys are—you know, you're—you practiced for 4 years. You got ready, and then COVID hit, and you had to wait another year.</p>, <p>And I just think you're—I just can't tell you how—you know, you remind us of what an amazing country we are, and you make us look so good as a country. These are the things that people look at around the world, more than anything that I do as your President or other people do in public life. They get the impression of who we are as Americans—who we are. And you're—and you handled yourself with such grace and such decency. It just—you made me so damn proud.</p>, <p><i>The First Lady.</i> And I wanted to just say thank you for the warm welcome that I received when I went to Tokyo. And so I saw a first: I saw the three-on-three basketball game. Everything I saw, we won. I was so happy. And I saw the soccer game, and I saw the swimming, and I saw softball. And it was just—I mean, it was so exciting just to watch—just to watch you compete.</p>, <p>And like Joe said, you did it with such dignity and grace, with all that you've been through these past few years, you know, the training and waiting and waiting.</p>, <p>And we just—you know, as the President and First Lady, I mean, we just could not feel more proud of all of you and everything you did in representing our country. And the—and all Americans feel the exact same way.</p>, <p>When you come home, you'll see everybody is glued to their TVs to see what's going to happen next. And you made us proud, and I want to thank you so much.</p>, <p>And it was just great. I couldn't talk to a lot of you, but at least I could wave from the sidelines and represent our country.</p>, <p>So thank you for the opportunity, for allowing me to be there to represent you.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And by the way, the Japanese Prime Minister is a very smart guy. And he's a friend. I know him. But he asked Jill to come and represent the country, not me. [<i>Laughter</i>]So, you know, he really knows what he's doing. He knows how to get things done.</p>, <p>But just can't tell you, you all—you just made our hearts swell. Not a joke. You restored the soul of America in so many ways. You really, really did. That's not hyperbole; that's a fact.</p>, <p>But I need a promise from all of you: You'll all come see us in the White House in the fall. We'll set a date you—and I'd love to have you all come to the White House if you're willing to do that so the Nation can see and I can brag more on you.</p>, <p>And the —you know, our Ambassador to the United Nations is Linda Thomas-Greenfield—was there. But I just want you to know she's going to—I don't know—you're just incredible. I mean——</p>, <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Can't wait to see you.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] That's a fact. We're probably keeping you too long already. But there's about 10 events I'd like to talk about, but I'll wait until you get to the White House.</p>, <p><i>U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee Chief Executive Officer Sarah Hirshland.</i> Well, thank you President Biden and First Lady Dr. Biden. And I'd love—I know we have so many of Team U.S.A. athletes on the line, but I'd love to take just a moment and introduce you to three special athletes.</p>, <p>The first is track and field star, and four-time Olympian Kara Winger, who will serve as our closing ceremony flag bearer, carrying our flag as they march this evening to close the ceremony. So, Kara, can I ask you—tell us how it feels to walk with the flag tonight, to know that's what's coming up for you today.</p>, <p><i>Javelin thrower Kara E. Winger.</i> I really—thank you, Sarah. First of all, happy to be here. I really can't even imagine still what it's going to be like to walk into that stadium with the flag.</p>, <p>I've had more disappointment in my career than victory, and to be voted on by this incredible Team U.S.A. for this honor is more amazing than I can put into words.</p>, <p>So, just incredibly honored, very excited, really amazed that I get to have this closure moment because these teammates voted for me in my last Olympic Games since I've never been on that podium. But I'm so proud to represent them because it's such an honor that they chose me.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> They picked you because of your character, kid.</p>, <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Ms. Winger.</i> It's wild. It's the biggest honor of my life. I'm so, so proud. Yes. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Ms. Hirshland.</i> Wow, terrific. Congratulations. And—and, Mr. President, I can vouch for her character. You're exactly right, she's an amazing woman.</p>, <p>Let's talk about someone else whose character is pretty extraordinary and move to track and field athlete Isaiah Jewett. Isaiah caught our attention from his act of sportsmanship after being tripped in the qualifying round of his 800-meter heat. His moment of kindness is one we will all remember.</p>, <p>Isaiah, can you take us through a little bit about what happened?</p>, <p><i>Runner Isaiah C. Jewett.</i> Hi, yes, of course. First, I would love to—I just want to address—love you guys. Big fan. Love what you're doing. I'd love to come to the White House too. Just want to throw that out there.</p>, <p>But—[<i>laughter</i>]—in the—in terms of the race: I don't know, I was really feeling pretty good about the race and how I was executing, and I felt like I was really into the zone.</p>, <p>And then, as soon as I came into the turn, I felt a knee hit my foot, and it made me trip over my leg. And then, when I tried to recover, I felt another foot hit me again. And I knew, like, as soon as I got onto the ground, like my dreams of getting to the final and placing were done.</p>, <p>And I felt kind of hurt for a second while I was laying down. And I actually looked at the other runner, and I saw how defeated he looked. And, for some reason, I just felt like: ""In some way, I want to help out. In some way, like, this is—this is bigger than me. Like, I know that he's been here a couple of times, and this is probably a couple of his last ones.""</p>, <p>But I just wanted to do whatever I could to say, like: ""Hey, man, it's okay. Let's finish this race together."" Like, I wanted to be some type of hero and show that, you know—just some good sportsmanship at the end of the day, because I felt like that's what's important—like not dwelling on these things—not dwelling on these problems that happen, but finishing what we started and making sure everybody is okay.</p>, <p>Because at the end of the day, we're all people, and we all go through the same nervousness and we all go through the same pains. So might as well finish what we started and just be happy that we're actually here in the moment, because not a lot of people made it here.</p>, <p>So I was just so happy in the fact that I was able to be a hero to a lot of people and even just be at the Olympic Games. It's just such a blessing, even to be here talking to you guys. It's just such a blessing meeting all you guys. And sorry if I'm rambling on. It's just so crazy being in the present——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Come on.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Jewett. </i>——in the present moment of, like, this Olympics, like just seeing different people and competing and being noticed. And that's what I really loved about being heard and being shown, like, your true character.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Isaiah, let me say something.</p>, <p><i>The First Lady.</i> He's our—you are our hero.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And by the way, Isaiah—all kidding aside—America, when it leads the world leads not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. That's the God's truth, and you are an epitome of that. And we thank you for it. We thank you for it.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Jewett.</i> Oh, man—[<i>inaudible</i>].</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> On the power of our example. I really mean it. It had profound impact around the world. It really did. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Jewett.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Ms. Hirshland.</i> Speaking of profound impact, our last athlete really needs no introduction. Simone Biles exemplifies what it means to be a true Olympic champion.</p>, <p>We have been blown away by Simone's accomplishments in the gym, and are now forever inspired and grateful to her for prioritizing mental health and well-being, and continuing to serve as a role model for Team U.S.A. and for the country.</p>, <p>Simone, thank you for being here. How does it feel to be home?</p>, <p><i>Gymnast Simone A. Biles.</i> Yes, hi. [<i>Laughter</i>] It feels amazing to be home. It's been a long journey. The Olympics was not how I expected it to go, but putting my mental and my physical health first will probably be one of my greatest accomplishments.</p>, <p>If you would have asked me in my younger years, I would have probably been too stubborn. But at that point, I knew that I just had to take a step back, let the other girls go up and do their job. And I'm very proud of the way they handled everything, especially last minute with me having to step back. But to have mental health be talked about more in sports is really nice, because, at the end of the day, we are humans before athletes.</p>, <p>So it is nice to be back home, though, yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, you've set an example. I really mean it, Simone. I mean—you know, one of the things that Mrs. Biden—Jill and I have worked on is, we work with a lot of soldiers who are coming home with posttraumatic stress. And they're like you athletes. They're—you—you never say no, you never give up, you never say you can't do it, you just keep going.</p>, <p><i>Ms. Biles.</i> Right.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> But—and so for a military person to say ""I need help"" is incredibly, incredibly difficult, but it shouldn't be. It's just—it's no different than if you broke your finger or broke your arm or had a physical injury.</p>, <p>And you're one of the greatest athletes in the world. You had the courage—no, I really mean it. I'm not playing games. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Ms. Biles.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> You had the courage to say, ""I need some help. We need some help. I need some time."" And you gave an example to everybody. And guess what? You got back up on that damn beam. [<i>Laughter</i>] And by the way, you know, what frightens me the most is the beam.</p>, <p><i>Ms. Biles.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I always thought I was a pretty good athlete. I was a pretty good baseball and football player, and I—you know, in high school. My Walter Mitty dream was playing in the pros. You think I'm kidding. I'm not. I had to give it up because I—you know, I become President. What the hell? I had to settle. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But all kidding aside—all kidding aside, it was—it's just amazing to watch you all, and just to watch even those of you who did not get involved in a particularly focused, you know, dilemma. But just the way you treated one another. Just the way you could see it.</p>, <p>I guess you knew the cameras were on you in all the events that are watching you get in and out of the pool, on and off the track, on and off the high—the parallel bar—the uneven parallel bar. I mean, all of it.</p>, <p>But I'll tell you what, doing a flip on a 4-inch beam is my idea of going to purgatory, I'll tell you. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'll try almost anything else before I try that. Anyway.</p>, <p><i>The First Lady.</i> So you brought us joy, and I think this country has really been through just—you know, has needed healing. And I think that all the athletes in the games really brought Americans together and brought us joy again. And for that, I thank you.</p>, <p>And I have to mention, I love that we have so many moms on the screen, you know—[<i>laughter</i>]—holding their babies. So that's so great to see that too, that—I think there are 10 moms who competed, so good for you. Good for you. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> God love you all.</p>, <p>David, you could smile, man. It's okay. David Hughes, I see you on the—how come you haven't smiled yet? [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>The First Lady.</i> There you go.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> There you go. [<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you, man. You're a hell of an athlete. You're one hell of an athlete.</p>, <p>Anyway, I shouldn't get going. I can get myself in trouble here. But I<i> </i>am—get in trouble for things I say, I know. No one ever doubts I mean what I say; the problem is, I sometimes say all that I mean.</p>, <p>Well, anyway. But thank you, thank you for the joy, the pride, the hope—the hope you gave us all. That's what you did, you gave people so much hope. Thank you.</p>, <p>See you in the White House.</p>, <p><i>The First Lady.</i> See you in the White House.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thanks.</p>, <p><i>Ms. Hirshland.</i> Thank you so much for being with us.</p>, <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Thanks. Thanks, Sarah.</p>, <p><i>Ms. Hirshland.</i> We'll see you soon in the White House.</p>, <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> We're counting on it.</p>]"
13,2,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation and the National Economy,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-infrastructure-and-jobs-legislation-and-the-national-economy,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good morning. What a good morning.</p>, <p>Yesterday the United States Senate took the additional step toward passing the bipartisan infrastructure bill. It's a bill that would end years of gridlock in Washington, and create millions of good-paying jobs, and put America on a new path to win the race for the economy in the 21st century; a historic investment in roads and rail, in transit and bridges, in clean energy and clean water. It will enable us to not only build back, but build back better than before the economic crisis hit.</p>, <p>I want to thank the bipartisan group of Senators for working together and the committee chairs for raising their ideas and concerns with me and Vice President Harris and members of our Cabinet.</p>, <p>As we did with the transcontinental railroad and the Interstate Highway System, we'll soon, once again, transform America and propel us into the future.</p>, <p>This bill makes key investments to put people to work all across the country: in cities, in towns, in rural communities, small towns, big towns, coastal—along the coastlines, out on the plains. It covers the Nation. And it's going to put America to work in good-paying union jobs, building and repairing our roads, bridges, ports, airports.</p>, <p>And you know, once this bill passes the Senate, I know that body will move toward establishing a framework for the remainder of my Build Back Better agenda—in giving tax cuts to the middle class by investing in childcare and home care for seniors, critical investments to combat climate change and to build a clean energy future—vital steps needed to bring down the cost of health care and so much more.</p>, <p>And we're going to do it without raising taxes by even 1 cent on people making less than $400,000 a year.</p>, <p>And here's another important part of the bill: Ninety percent of the jobs created by this legislation will not require a college degree. Ninety percent. It's a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America.</p>, <p>Which brings me to another piece of good news this morning: We learned that the economy created 943,000 new jobs in July—943,000. And the unemployment rate fell by a half a percent to 5.4 percent.</p>, <p>Now, while our economy is far from complete and while we have—doubtlessly, we'll have ups and downs along the way as we continue to battle the Delta surge of COVID, what is indisputable now is this: The Biden plan is working, the Biden plan produces results, and the Biden plan is moving the country forward.</p>, <p>We're now the first administration in history to add jobs every single month in our first 6 months in office and the only one in history to add more than 4 million jobs during the first 6 months. Economic growth is the fastest in 40 years. Jobs are up. The unemployment rate is the lowest since the pandemic hit. Black unemployment is down as well.</p>, <p>Why? Because we put in place the necessary tools early in my Presidency—the COVID vaccine—the COVID-19 vaccine plan, the American Rescue Plan—to fight the virus and fight the economic mess we inherited. As a result, we've been able to make progress on both fronts against grave challenges. And we have—we put in place the tools to prevent this Delta variant wave of COVID-19 from shutting down our small businesses, our schools, and our society.</p>, <p>You know, when we first got to office, the COVID-19 crisis and economic crisis were unrelenting and devastating for people. And as a nation, we didn't have to the tools to deal with either. Nearly 4,000 Americans were dying each and every day to the virus. Four thousand a day. The economy had been wiped out. We were down 10 million jobs from where we were before the pandemic. We were in a dark winter with real concerns about what spring would bring.</p>, <p>But then, we got to work. We passed the American Rescue Plan shortly after I was sworn in. That gave us the tools to fight the pandemic and rebuild our economy, and it produced results.</p>, <p>To beat the pandemic, we ramped up testing and protective equipment. And we bought it—we brought—we actually went out and bought enough vaccine so that every single, solitary American could be vaccinated.</p>, <p>And because of the help of everyone, from the military to civilian efforts, we carried out one of the most difficult logistical challenges in our Nation's history: to get 220 million shots into people's arms in first 100 days in office. Two hundred and twenty million.</p>, <p>Over the past 7 months, we've cut COVID-19 deaths by 90 percent. As of today, 193 million Americans have gotten at least one vaccination shot, including over 70 percent of adults over the age of 18. A hundred and sixty-five million Americans are now fully vaccinated.</p>, <p>Because of our success with the vaccination effort, this new Delta variant wave of COVID-19 will be very different—be able to deal with than the one that under—that we under—was underway when I took office.</p>, <p>And yes, cases are going to go up before they come back down. It's a pandemic of the unvaccinated. I know I've said that constantly, and others have as well. The vaccination of the unvaccinated. You know, and it's needless—taking a needless toll on our country.</p>, <p>You know, we have, roughly, 350 million people vaccinated [doses administered]* in the United States and billions around the world, and virtually no one has died because of that vaccinations. But even so, the impact is going to be very different than what happened last January.</p>, <p>Today about 400 people will die because of the Delta variant in this country, a tragedy because virtually all of these deaths were preventable if people had gotten vaccinated.</p>, <p>But 7 months ago today, almost 4,000 people died on that very day from COVID-19. Four thousand versus four hundred. That shows how much our vaccination progress has already done to protect us from the worst of the new Delta COVID-19 wave.</p>, <p>Likewise, the American Rescue Plan has given us the economic tools we need to protect our recovery against the worst impacts of the Delta virus: 1,400 checks into the pockets—$1,400 checks into the pockets of millions of American; help to keep the folks in their homes; help to put food on the table.</p>, <p>Remember those long lines we used to talk about? People lined up in their cars for hours just to get a box of food put in their trunk.</p>, <p>Help to small businesses so they could keep the lights on, their doors open, and their employees on the job. Because States were losing revenue. They were having to lay off essential workers. Well, the aid to States and cities and counties and Tribes, it kept essential workers going—police officers, firefighters, educators on the job.</p>, <p>Funding for schools to reopen, and ventilation systems, sanitation services, protective equipment to keep students and staff safe.</p>, <p>And as we vaccinated America, we developed our economic tools to help our economy recover. As a result, in the past 3 months, we've created, on average, 832,000 new jobs per month since sworn in. That's compared to five thousand—50,000 jobs in the last 3 months of the previous administration.</p>, <p>Look, even so, my message today is not one of celebration. It's one to remind us we've got a lot of hard work left to be done, both to beat the Delta variant and to continue our advance of economic recovery. We all know what it starts with. As I've said again and again, this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. So we have to get more people vaccinated.</p>, <p>I said well over—what's the number again? I have to remind myself—350 million Americans have already been vaccinated [doses have been administered].* They're doing fine.</p>, <p>I'm pleased to report that, the past week, we've seen the first-time vaccinations in America go up by 4 million people getting—4 million shots. That's more than we've seen in a long time.</p>, <p>I want to thank the Governors. I listened to the Governor of Maryland today on the television. He's doing a heck of a job. Democratic Governors as well, Republican Governors, they're getting the word out.</p>, <p>Look, as you all know, I've put in place new incentives and requirements to encourage vaccinations. For example, Federal workers will be asked to attest to their vaccination status. Anyone who does not attest or is not vaccinated will be required to wear a mask no matter where they work, test one or two times a week, socially distance, and generally will not be allowed to travel for work.</p>, <p>There will be more to come in the days ahead. And once again, I want to thank the local leaders and the private-sector leaders who are imposing vaccine requirements.</p>, <p>America can beat the Delta variant, just as we beat the original COVID-19. We can do this. So wear a mask where recommended. Get vaccinated today. All of that will save lives, and it means we're not going to have the same kind of economic damage we've seen when COVID-19 began.</p>, <p>But we aren't stopping there. The American Rescue Plan was built knowing the recovery would take time and that there'd be ups and downs.</p>, <p>So let me outline today six specific actions people will see over the next few weeks to make sure that we fight the Delta variant and wait for new vaccinations to be finished and keep our economy strong.</p>, <p>First, thanks to the latest middle class tax cut in a long time, the next monthly check—that is the child tax credit—in the next month—next 9 days, checks are going—all going out to almost 40 million families with children—in 9 days, beginning next month—the middle of this month, I should say.</p>, <p>On August 15, for example, a family with two young kids under the age of 7 is going to get a check for $600 paid immediately. And they'll get a check next week—next month for $600, et cetera. If you're a family with two kids between the ages of 7 and 17, you're getting a check for $500, $250 per child. And that will continue month after month.</p>, <p>Second, I've looked ahead—we've looked ahead, and now schools have the resources they need to safely reopen as schoolyear starts again so that every child can be in school full time, safe, and this year.</p>, <p>Third, we provided, months ago, States and localities with $45 billion in their coffers—the State and localities—to help renters and landlords to keep people in their homes and keep their local economy strong. That money has to get out now. I'm urging all local officials to get that money out.</p>, <p>And we're going to send more help to small businesses on Main Street so the Delta variant doesn't cause them to lay off employees and shutter their doors. There's something called the Paycheck Protection Program. It's a loan program, forgivable if a small business kept their employees on the job and their doors open. We're now in the process to forgive those loans for small businesses who are doing the right thing, putting them in a better position to keep their businesses going.</p>, <p>Fifth, if anyone is worried about getting health insurance during the pandemic, there's help today. For those who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, we're covering more people with more extensive benefits, with premiums that average 40-percent lower. If you don't have insurance, you can still sign up under the Affordable Care Act through August the 15th. Just go to healthcare.gov today.</p>, <p>And sixth, we're going to lower the prices on everything from prescription drugs to hearing aids by allowing businesses to compete, which will give them more choices at lower cost. For example: You're not going to have to go to a doctor to get a prescription to get a hearing aid. You're going to go right to the counter of the store and buy it over the counter.</p>, <p>The bottom line is this: What we are doing is working. But don't take my word for it. Forecasters on Wall Street project, over the next 10 years, our economy will expand by trillions of dollars and will create 2 million more jobs a year, good-paying jobs.</p>, <p>But we just have to keep going. And it's simple. That means: Get vaccinated, please. It's safe. It works. It will save lives and maybe save your life. As I've said before, this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. So, please, get vaccinated.</p>, <p>We can get this done. We just have to stay the course. And we just have to remember who we are. You've heard me say it before: We're the United States of America. There's not a single thing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we do it together.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. And have a good weekend. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, would you take a few questions?</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President—[<i>inaudible</i>]—Federal staffs to increase vaccinations?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, to what extent is the economic recovery at risk if the Delta variant continues to spread?</p>]"
13,3,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on Signing Legislation Awarding Congressional Gold Medals to the United States Capitol Police and Those Who Protected the U.S. Capitol on January Sixth,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-legislation-awarding-congressional-gold-medals-the-united-states-capitol,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good afternoon. Thank you, Vice President Harris.</p>, <p>Folks, not even during the Civil War did insurrectionists breach the Capitol of the United States of America, the citadel of our democracy—not even then. But on January the 6th, 2021, they did. They did. A mob of extremists and terrorists launched a violent and deadly assault on the people's house and the sacred ritual to certify a free and fair election.</p>, <p>It wasn't dissent. It wasn't debate. It wasn't democracy. It was insurrection. It was riot and mayhem. It was radical and chaotic. And it was unconstitutional. And maybe most important, it was fundamentally un-American, an existential threat and a test of whether our democracy could survive, whether it could overcome lies and overcome the fury of a few who were seeking to thwart the will of the many.</p>, <p>But while the attack on our values and our votes shocked and saddened the Nation, our democracy did survive. It did. Truth defeated lies. We did overcome.</p>, <p>And that's because of the women and men of the U.S. Capitol Police, the Washington DC Metropolitan Police Department, and other law enforcement officials who we honor today.</p>, <p>Speaker Pelosi, who led the effort in the House; Senators Klobuchar and Blunt, the co-sponsors of the legislation in the Senate; and to all my colleagues—Pat Leahy and House Members as well that are here: Thank you. Thank you.</p>, <p>Today I'm going to sign into law the bill you sent me that awards the Congressional Gold Medal to the United States Capitol Police, the Washington DC Metropolitan Police Department, and other law enforcement for their service in defense of our democracy on January the 6th.</p>, <p>To all of them, on behalf of a grateful nation, thank you, thank you, thank you for protecting our Capitol, maybe even more importantly, for protecting our Constitution and saving the lives of duly elected Members of the Senate and the House and their staffs.</p>, <p>In these moments when we're still debating—these were tragic hours back then—you stood in the breach. You did your duty, a duty to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. The events that transpired were surprising, but not your character or your courage, Chief, and all your men and women.</p>, <p>I didn't grow up with any of you, but I know you. You're just like all the women and men I grew up with—particularly, at that time, it was men—in Scranton and Claymont, places where—the neighborhood I lived in—you became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest. [<i>Laughter</i>] I wasn't qualified for any of them—[<i>laughter</i>]—so here I am. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But look, all kidding aside, I got to know you. You're the same ones, after a ballgame in a visiting field, come walking out of the gym if you won, and you may get jumped by the other team or their supporters. You may be all by yourself—the only one standing there when you watch six people jump one of our teammates. What the hell would you do? You'd jump in. You'd jump in, knowing you're going to get the hell beat of you too.</p>, <p>Police officers are not what you do, it's who you are. I got to know you after 36 years in the Senate, 8 years as Vice President. You're always there. It's not a joke. It's not some hyperbole to suggest ""duty, honor, service."" That's who you are. That's who your dad was. It's who your dad was. And America owes you a debt we can never fully repay.</p>, <p>But I know receiving this award is bittersweet. On that day, more than 140 law enforcement officers suffered physical injuries, an untold number suffering emotional toll. Fifteen of you were hospitalized, and others were lost forever. May their souls rest in peace and rise in glory.</p>, <p>I know each time you put on that shield in the morning or whenever you show for work, your families wonder whether they're going to get a call that day—a call they don't want to receive—hoping you come home safely.</p>, <p>And it breaks my heart—it breaks the heart of the Nation—to remember that you were assaulted by thousands of violent insurrectionists at the Capitol of the United States of America. Jill and I would never have thought we'd have to join you in the Capitol Rotunda not once, but twice. Once to honor Officer Brian Sicknick, who lost his life. And a second time to honor Officer Billy Evans, who lost his defending the Capitol as well. Both gave the full measure of their devotion to the country at the United States Capitol.</p>, <p>Their families are here today. I know from similar—yes, we should clap for the families. [<i>Applause</i>] I know, like others may know, from personal experience, getting that phone call. It's nice to be honored and have those who you lost remembered, but it's tough to be here because it brings back everything like it happened 10 minutes ago.</p>, <p>So I offer you not only our condolences, but recognize your courage, the courage of your children. And you have our most profound gratitude.</p>, <p>You know, the fallen, in my view, are casualties of a struggle, literally, for the soul of America, a struggle that they didn't start, a struggle we didn't seek, and a struggle that, by the grace of God, we'll win. As I said, I know this is a bittersweet moment. As proud of Brian and Billy as you are, it still brings back pain, the moment it happened.</p>, <p>And also, we also offer our prayers to the families of the Capitol Police officer, Howard Liebengood. Those who have been around a while, we knew his dad. We knew his dad well. He was Secretary of the United States—Sergeant at Arms of the United States Senate. We also pray for the families of the Metro Police officer, Jeffrey Smith. For anyone out there facing trauma, for anyone still struggling, please know there is help available.</p>, <p>My fellow Americans, the tragedy of that day deserves the truth above all else. We cannot allow history to be rewritten. We cannot allow the heroism of these officers to be forgotten. We have to understand what happened, the honest and unvarnished truth. We have to face it. That's what great nations do, and we are a great nation.</p>, <p>In the past weeks and months, we've heard the officers themselves—some of whom are here today—describe what happened: the threats, the violence, the savageness. When asked what he was fighting for, Officer Hodges, who is here today, stated it eloquently, one word: ""Democracy.""</p>, <p>My fellow Americans, let's remember what this was all about. It was a violent attempt to overturn the will of the American people; to seek power at all costs; to replace the ballot with brute force; to destroy, not to build. Without democracy, nothing is possible. With it, everything is.</p>, <p>So, my fellow Americans, we must all do our part to perfect and to preserve our democracy. It requires people of good will and courage to stand up to the hate, the lies, the extremism that led to this vicious attack. It requires all of us working together—Democrats, Republicans, Independents—on behalf of the common good to restore decency, honor, and respect for our system of government.</p>, <p>And above all, it requires all of us to remember who we are at our best as a nation, as we see in the law enforcement officers who are here today, the best of our Nation.</p>, <p>The Congressional Gold Medal awards today will be housed in four locations. Two medals will be displayed at the U.S. Capitol Police Department in Washington—and the Washington DC Metropolitan Police Departments so that every morning, as you officers walk by, seeing those medals, they'll remember the heroism of their colleagues and the importance of their work.</p>, <p>The third medal will be displayed at the Smithsonian Museum with a plaque honoring all law enforcement that protected the Capitol on January 6, so all visitors can understand what happened that day.</p>, <p>And the fourth one will be displayed at the Capitol itself, to remind all who served and currently serve there and all who visit the honor and the service of those who protect and preserve all of us.</p>, <p>I will now ask Speaker Pelosi, if she's able—not able, willing—[<i>laughter</i>]—and Senator Klobuchar and Senator Blunt, Chief Contee and Chief Manger, and the other officers here today to join me as I sign this bill into law.</p>, <p>May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops and all those who serve watch over our democracy.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the bill and distributed pens.</i>]</p>]"
13,4,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on Signing the Executive Order on Strengthening American Leadership on Clean Cars and Trucks and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-the-executive-order-strengthening-american-leadership-clean-cars-and,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Please, everybody, sit down—please, please, please. Good afternoon.</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Good afternoon.</p>, <p><i>Death of AFL-CIO President Richard L. Trumka, Sr. </i></p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I—before I begin, let me start with something—I apologize—more somber. I learned a couple of hours ago, when my staff came in, that a close friend of mine—and I think of many of you as well—Rich Trumka died today from a heart attack.</p>, <p>The reason I was a few minutes late coming out—and I apologize for that—I was talking to his wife and to his son, who called.</p>, <p>He wasn't just a great labor leader, he was a friend. And he was a friend of yours too, Debbie, I think. And he was someone I could confide in. And you knew whatever he said he'd do, he would do. It was simple, Tommy; you knew him well as well. He was always there.</p>, <p>He was an American worker. Always fighting for working people, protecting their wages, their safety, their pensions, and their ability to build a middle class life.</p>, <p>I've also believed that the middle class built America, but I know who built the middle class: unions. Unions built the middle class. There is no doubt that Rich Trumka helped build unions all across this country.</p>, <p>My heart goes out to Barbara and Rich Jr. and the grandkids. And I might point out that, you know, I used to always kid him—he was from soft coal country; I was from hard coal country. [<i>Laughter</i>] We used to have this thing about—you know, he used to be president of the United Mine Workers, and that's how he got started.</p>, <p><i>Executive Order on Strengthening American Leadership on Clean Cars and Trucks </i></p>, <p>Folks, let's—let me now turn to today's events—event. I want to thank Bernie for the introduction and for being part of the best autoworkers in the world. Thank you, Ray Curry, president of the UAW. If you're here, Ray, I was in with you—it's good to see you, pal.</p>, <p>And I also want to thank the leaders of the Big Three companies for being here today. Mary Barra, she's with General Motors. She—I want to tell you—I think she's one of the reasons we're here today. We had a long discussion on a Zoom call with a bunch of labor leaders and other—other major business leaders, and she made a commitment, and she's keeping it. Thank you very much, Madam Chair.</p>, <p>Jim Farley of Ford. And by the way, my dad was in the automobile business. He sold Fords for a while, but mostly General Motors projects for—products. But you see that sucker over there? Zero to sixty in 4.1 seconds. It's all electric, I tell you what.</p>, <p>And I want to say publicly, I have a commitment from Mary when they make the first electric Corvette, I get to drive it. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right, Mary? [<i>Laughter</i>] You think I'm kidding. I'm not kidding. And my entire Secret Service detail went: ""Oh my God. Let's go.""</p>, <p>And Mark Stewart of Stellantis. I—you know, I—Mark, we used to have one of your big plants in my State. And as the man I'm about to recognize—you know, a special thanks to all the Members of Congress are here, but I want to pay particular recognition to my chairman, my buddy—we served together for years—Tommy Carper. Tom.</p>, <p>And I know that—I kid my Michigan friends, but you know, I just want you to know—say to Senators Heinrich and Markey and Whitehouse and Padilla and, you know, Duckworth—and I'm leaving some folks out, I'm sure. Representative Kathy Castor. You know, and the Michigan delegation that's here today: Debbie Stabenow; Senator Gary Peters; Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, who is automobiles—[<i>laughter</i>]—and Dan Kildee.</p>, <p>But I want you all to know—I remind the Michigan delegation of this: It used to be, when I was—first got elected, Deb—and I used to tell your husband this well—we had a higher percentage of autoworkers in Delaware than any State in the Union, including—including—Michigan. Now, the fact we that we had a very small population and we—[<i>laughter</i>]—and we had almost 100,000 autoworkers in our States, counting the Autolite and others, had something to do with it. But I just want to be very straightforward. You know, UAW ""brung me to the dance,"" as they say.</p>, <p>And I also know we're missing someone truly special and a dear friend of all of us—Senator Carl Levin, who passed away last week. Carl and I served together for 30 years in the United States Senate together. He was one of the most—and I think all my colleagues who knew him will attest to this—one of the most honorable people, most decent people I've not only served with, but I've ever known.</p>, <p>He was a tireless champion of the American worker and the iconic American automobile industry. And so he embodied everything that his beloved Michigan and his—our country represents: respect, dignity, pride—pride in the Nation and pride in what we built.</p>, <p>And so today, labor and industry, State and local leaders are all working together to write the next chapter of the American story. As I've said before, we're in competition with China and many other nations for the 21st century. To win, we're going to have to make sure the future will be made in America.</p>, <p>You know, back in May, I toured the Ford plant, as I mentioned—a state-of-the-art facility in Dearborn—where the UAW workers like Bernie are building the first-ever all-electric Ford 150 [F-150].* And as I said, the best part is, I got to drive it. It's incredible, just like the other vehicles that are behind me today. They're a vision of the future that is now beginning to happen, a future of the automobile industry that is electric: battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, fuel cell electric. It's electric, and there's no turning back.</p>, <p>The question is whether we'll lead or fall behind in the race for the future. It's whether we'll build these vehicles and the batteries that got them to where they are in the United States—here in the United States, or we're going to have to rely on other countries for those batteries. Whether or not the jobs to build these vehicles and batteries are good-paying union jobs, jobs with benefits, jobs that's going to sustain continued growth of the middle class. They have to be. They have to be made here in America.</p>, <p>Right now China is leading the race, and is one of the largest and fastest growing electric vehicle markets in the world. And a key part of the electric vehicle—to state the obvious—is the battery. And right now 80 percent of the manufacturing capacity for these batteries is done in China.</p>, <p>And here's the deal: It's not that China battery—it's not China's battery technology that's much more innovative than anyone else's. Remember, our national labs in America, our universities, our automakers led in the development of this technology. We led in the development of this technology. And there's no reason why we can't reclaim that leadership and lead again. But we just have to move, and we have to move fast.</p>, <p>You know, when Barack and I were in office—President Obama and I were in office—that's what we were doing. In 2009, the automobile industry was flat on its back. We were told that we'd never be able to sell American-made cars at the same rate as we did before. But we didn't listen to the naysayers. We even had some—in all—in both parties who didn't think we should, quote, ""bail out"" the industry, if you remember.</p>, <p>Well, we bet on the American worker. And we extended a lifeline. And they stepped up and made sacrifices to do it, and they saved more than—we saved more than a million jobs in the process. Working with the auto industry, we set fuel efficiency standards and provided incentives for folks to buy fuel-efficient vehicles.</p>, <p>Through the Recovery Act, we made the largest investment in clean energy and battery technology ever made. And then, the previous administration came along into office, and they rolled back the standards we set.</p>, <p>Despite bipartisan support for consumer incentives, they also let the Federal tax credit expire, penalizing autoworkers who were, at the time, selling the most electric vehicles in the world—in the United States. They announced infrastructure—when we—they announced infrastructure week, they did it for every week for 4 years, and not once got anything done. Not once.</p>, <p>Folks, the rest of the world is moving ahead, and we've just got to step up: government, labor, and industry working together—what you're seeing here today. We have a playbook, and it's going to work.</p>, <p>Today I'm announcing steps we're taking to set a new pace for electric vehicles. First, I'm following through on the campaign commitment to reverse the previous administration's short-sighted rollback of vehicle emissions and efficiency standards. And I'm doing so and—with the support of the auto industry—the automobile industry.</p>, <p>Today the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation are unveiling proposals to do just that. These agencies are beginning to work on the next round of standards for a broad class of vehicles: for cars, SUVs, pickup trucks, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.</p>, <p>Importantly, we have announcements today from automakers representing nearly the entire auto industry market who have positioned around the ambition that of 40 to 50 percent of all vehicles sold by 2030 in America being electric. This is a big deal.</p>, <p>But to unlock the full potential, we have to keep investing in our workers and our manufacturing capacity. And that's what our Build Back Better plan is all about. It's about leveraging once-in-a-generation investments and a whole-of-Government effort to lift up American autoworkers and strengthen the American leadership in the world in the clean car technology—trucks—not just cars, but trucks as well, and buses.</p>, <p>You know, that's why today I'm signing an Executive order setting out a target of 50 percent of all passenger vehicles sold by 2030 will be electric and set into motion an all-out effort. That's why, along with the Members of Congress here today, we're working around the clock on the Build Back Better plan, which does three critical things.</p>, <p>One, it transforms our infrastructure. We're going to put Americans to work modernizing our roads, our highways, our ports, our airports, rail, and transit systems.</p>, <p>You know, that included putting IBEW members and other union workers to work installing a national network of 500,000 charging stations along our roads and highways and at our homes and our apartments.</p>, <p>Two, we're going to boost our manufacturing capacity. The Build Back Better plan invests in new rooted facilities—excuse me, new and retooled facilities; and employs workers with good-paying wages, good jobs; and grants—the grants that kickstart new battery and parts production; loans and tax credits to boost manufacturing of these clean vehicles.</p>, <p>And our Build Back Better plan makes the largest investment in research and development in generations. This will help innovate, manufacture, and build the supply chains for batteries, semiconductors, and those small computer chips that electric trucks and cars that are going to be even more reliant upon as we move forward.</p>, <p>Never again should we be in the situation we face today with a semiconductor shortage. And we know these kinds of Federal investments—we know that they work. It was the Defense Department and NASA that got the modern semiconductor industry on its feet decades ago. Our own Department of Energy pioneered and transformed the battery industry where Barack and I—when we went into office—when we were in office.</p>, <p>And with the help of the Recovery Act grants and loans, battery prices dropped 85 percent because we were forward looking. We need that same mindset today.</p>, <p>Thirdly, support of consumers and fleets. That means purchasing incentives for consumers to buy clean vehicles, union-made right here in America, like the ones championed by Debbie Stabenow and Ron Wyden in the Senate, which provides $7,500 basic credit, $2,500 credit for vehicles made in America, and an additional $2,500 credit for union-made vehicles.</p>, <p>That means spurring demand by converting the Federal Government's enormous fleet of vehicles—we have over 600,000 vehicles—we have a lot of vehicles—60,000 of them, I should say—into an all American-made clean vehicles.</p>, <p>So that's what we're going to do. As we roll out and get rid of the existing fleet, we're going to support the electric transit system as well and the electric school buses.</p>, <p>Look, and there's one other thing we have in our playbook that will help us outcompete other nations: The American worker. The American worker. I really believe this, and I know you guys do too. American workers are our ace in the deck.</p>, <p>Now, I know many of you watching at home are like the folks I grew up with in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware. They feel left out, left behind in an economy and in an industry that's rapidly changing. I get it. I understand it.</p>, <p>But we're going to leave no one behind. Nearly 90 percent of the jobs created in our infrastructure plan do not require a bachelor's degree. And when we invest in our infrastructure, we're going to buy American products, American materials, and services from American businesses made in America, by American workers.</p>, <p>And we're going to do everything in our power to encourage and protect the right of workers to unionize and collectively bargain. The bottom line is, we are proposing a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America.</p>, <p>That's what it's going to be. And we need automakers and other companies to keep investing in America. We need them not to take the benefits of our public investments and expand electric vehicles and battery manufacturing production abroad. We need you to deepen your partnership with the UAW, continue to pay good wages, support local communities across the country.</p>, <p>That's why I'm so proud the UAW is standing here today as well. It's why I am proud that the three largest employers are sitting here and their sights are set not only on electric vehicles, but on expansion: expanding union jobs, expanding the middle class. It matters.</p>, <p>You know, in the spring, I kept my commitment to convene leaders of all the major economies in the world on—it was not in person, but we did it on a Zoom call with a whole bunch of folks—including the heads of state of China, India, Japan, the European Union—for a meeting hosted in the White House on the most consequential issues facing the world, and the agreement was, it's the climate crisis.</p>, <p>And I made clear—I made clear—what I've long believed when I think of—when I think of the climate crisis: Beyond the devastation to the lives and livelihoods and the health of our very planet, when I hear ""climate,"" I think ""jobs""—good-paying union jobs.</p>, <p>I wanted the world to see there was a consensus that all—that we're at an inflection point in world history. If we act to save the planet, we can also come out of it better. We can create millions of good-paying jobs that generate significant economic growth and opportunity and raise the standard of living for people not only here, but around the world.</p>, <p>But I also wanted to put the world on notice: America is back. America is back. We're in the competition for the 21st century—the future that will be built right here in America.</p>, <p>Let me close with this: Our economy is recovering. In 6 months, we're seeing the fastest job growth on record at this point in any administration in history, the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years. And we've shown each other and the world that there's no quit in America. None. None. None. And that it's never, ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America.</p>, <p>We are the United States of America. There is not a single, solitary thing—nothing—beyond our capacity to get done, if we and when we do it together. But we have to act. And that's what we are doing today.</p>, <p>And again, I want to thank the CEOs of the automobile companies, and I also want to thank all the autoworkers. Thank you all for being here today.</p>, <p>And now I am going to sign the Executive order, but I'd like to invite my congressional colleagues to come up—if they're willing to stand behind me here when we do this—and others who know they're supposed to come on up.</p>, <p>Thank you all very much.</p>, <p>Now, when I sign—it's so bright—when I sign this Executive order, usually I am able to give a pen to all the folks who are a part of it. I've got one pen, but I'm going to make sure you each—</p>, <p><i>Senator Deborah A. Stabenow.</i> Uh-oh. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Representative Daniel T. Kildee.</i> We're going to fight for it.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> You each are going to get a pen, I promise you.</p>, <p>This is an Executive order ""Strengthening America's Leadership in Clean Cars and Trucks."" And again, let me start off by thanking the CEOs, as well as the UAW. You all—all you elected are the reason why it's happening, man. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the Executive order.</i>]</p>, <p>All right.</p>, <p>Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>, <p>[<i>The President greeted participants, then left the signing desk and walked across the lawn, entering a parked vehicle. He then drove around the South Lawn driveway in a hybrid Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 4xe. As he exited the vehicle, reporters approached him on the lawn, and he answered questions as follows.</i>]</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>When was the last time you drove?</p>, <p><i>The President's Test-Drive of the Hybrid Jeep Rubicon Wrangler 4xe </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>How did it feel, Mr. President?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Do you like it better than the Lightning, Mr. President?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> It feels great, because, you know, you sit there, first of all, you don't hear a thing. [<i>Laughter</i>] Number one.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Can I try?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> It's not mine yet. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> What do you think about the future, Mr. President, the future of electric vehicles, with your proposal?</p>, <p><i>Vehicular Breathalyzer Technology Requirement </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>What do you think about these breathalyzers that are going in the cars—[<i>inaudible</i>]?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Pardon me?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>The bill that's coming up, making breathalyzers for vehicles in a couple of years mandatory?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That's a good idea, by the way. I think. I think that's a good idea.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Tell me why.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> President Biden, are you going to——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Because in large part it just helps the driver, because lots of times, people have a couple of drinks and don't realize—[<i>inaudible</i>].</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> President Biden——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> You still don't think tests should be mandatory?</p>, <p><i>Supply Chain Issues for Automobile Components/Manufacturing Strengthening Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>There's thousands of cars in lots around the country lacking chips, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I know they are. That's why we're going to invest billions of dollars in bringing chip manufacturing to the United States, a bipartisan effort that we've gotten done. It's going to work. Because we can't afford—we—for example, we've got the chairman of the board of Ford here somewhere—they had to slow down production because of the lack of chips. It's a gigantic, gigantic issue.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> How much did California's—[<i>inaudible</i>]——</p>, <p><i>Governor Ronald D. DeSantis of Florida </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Do you have a response to Governor DeSantis who is using your words about ""don't be in the way,"" and he's saying, ""I am in the way"" to block too much interference from the Federal Government? Your response, Mr. President?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Governor who? [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>DeSantis. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That's my response.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Vehicle Emission and Efficiency Standards/Research and Development </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>How did California's 2019 framework influence the Executive order that you signed today?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I think the framework was really helpful. And the reason I say that is that, you know, initially, the industry was opposed to it. And we literally sat over in the EEOB and I had five of the largest corporations in America, with Mary Barra representing General Motors down the street. And you've been there with me when I've done this. And five major labor unions.</p>, <p>And when it was all over, Mary Barra called and said, ""I'm going to withdraw the suit against California."" They were suing California. To say, ""You can't have a higher standard than the rest of the Nation,"" which was what, you know, the last President did. He lowered the—[<i>inaudible</i>]—standard.</p>, <p>And she said, ""I'm going to get—I'm going to drop the suit, and I'm going to go electric."" And we got the IBEW involved.</p>, <p>And the biggest thing that's happening here is, there's a realization, on the part of both labor and business now, that this is the future. We can't sit by.</p>, <p>Think about the battery technology. Most of that research and development occurred with United States taxpayers' dollars from the Department of Energy, the DOD, here in the United States. And we didn't take advantage of it. We didn't move on it. China moved, and China now owns the market. So we've just got to get back in the game.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Why is the vaccine not mandatory, sir?</p>, <p><i>Legal Restrictions on the Eviction Moratorium/Federal Assistance to State and Local Governments </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>How is the eviction moratorium constitutional, sir? How is it constitutional?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm sorry?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>How is the eviction moratorium constitutional, sir?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I think it is. But there's a call—there are a number of constitutional scholars—I spoke to a lot of constitutional scholars. Let me explain the last—the last time why I did what I did.</p>, <p>My greatest concern is—I have three concerns. One, we have $45 billion sitting in State treasuries right now that were designed specifically to help landlords be able to not have to go bankrupt so that the—and keep those renters who couldn't afford to pay their rent because of the pandemic, because of unemployment being as bad as it was since the Great Depression.</p>, <p>We gave it to the States and localities to be able to keep renters in their homes, as well as—as well as—being able to continue to keep their business going. The Court ruled by—and made it very clear—the Supreme Court said: ""You can't do that. You don't have the authority to do that."" And—although it was a 5-to-4 decision.</p>, <p>I got on the phone and contacted a number of constitutional scholars I've relied on for years, beyond my own team, and there was a split. And the consensus of the folks that I have used the most said, ""We think it is—you have the authority to do it, but, in this Court, who knows.""</p>, <p>Last point I'll make: So what I decided to do, I did not tell the CDC. I told—I made a commitment to you all, I would not tell the CDC what they should do, and I would not tell the Justice Department who they should prosecute. And I've kept that commitment.</p>, <p>So I asked the CDC to go back and take another look at was there anything possible and check with the legal scholars as well.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>The——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Now, wait a minute. They went back, and they concluded that if we had a completely different chain—we did not try to continue the existing moratorium; it was a different moratorium with another rationale. The rationale was that because of the COVID—spread of the virus so rapidly, that—and the Delta COVID—what happened was, they said: All those counties that, in fact, are in a situation where they are in that red zone, that they—we should hold for another month—or I think it said 2 months—the ability to evict people from those facilities. And I said, ""Okay, thank you.""</p>, <p>And I went ahead and did it, but here's the deal: I can't guarantee you the Court won't rule if we don't have that authority, but at least, we'll have the ability, if we have to appeal, to keep this going for a month at least—I hope longer than that. And in the process, by that time, we'll get a lot of—[<i>inaudible</i>].</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>]"

And we were on—dealing with the 10 people shot in a hateful act of bigotry at the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. Seven people lost their lives that day.</p>, <p>Today we honor everyone impacted by this tragedy. And we think about all the pain during this pandemic, with the rise of hate crimes, harassment, bullying, and other forms of bias against Asian Americans. It seems not to stop.</p>, <p>And after the shooting in the Atlanta area, Kamala and I traveled to Atlanta, met with a group—some of whom are here—of Asian American leaders. The discussion was very raw. It was powerful. And a common theme was that Asian Americans feeling unsafe, unwanted, and some of you indicated feeling invisible sometimes. Our message back to you was, at that moment: We see you. We see you.</p>, <p>A few months later, we stood here in the White House, and we signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law. It also was a powerful moment showing that we can come together—Democrat and Republican—we can come together as a nation and truly look out for one another. You know, that's why we wanted to convene this meeting to continue to strengthen our efforts because more must be done, in my view—our view.</p>, <p>A pandemic the AH—the AANI—NH and PI community—I stumbled over myself here—but has been on the frontlines from the beginning and is critical to helping us vaccinate America—not just get vaccinated but to vaccinate America.</p>, <p>The community is also critical in keeping the U.S. economy strong. In 6 months, we're seeing the fastest growth at this point in any administration's history, in no small part because of this community. The fastest growing economic growth in nearly 40 years.</p>, <p>And now we have an opportunity to make historic investments in our infrastructure and in our families and finally build an economy that deals everybody in, just doesn't come from top down, but from the middle and the bottom up. And creating millions of good-paying jobs in every community, including the AANHPI communities and delivering affordable childcare, paid leave, universal pre-K, as well as community college.</p>, <p>There is work to do on immigration; there's work to do on voting rights and so much more.</p>, <p>On my first day in office, I signed an Executive order to advance racial equity and a whole-of-Government approach to address inequities and injustice in America from every agency. And this group's input has been critical and continues to be critical to that approach.</p>, <p>And I look forward to the discussion that we're about to have and the actions that, God willing, we'll be able to follow.</p>, <p>So I want to thank you all again for being here, and we'll get to our meeting.

Biden,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-covid-19-response-and-national-vaccination-efforts-and-exchange-with-8,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good afternoon.</p>, <p>Last week, I laid out what we need to do to beat the COVID-19 virus—pandemic and the challenges posed by the Delta variant.</p>, <p>This is a very different variant than what we've dealt with previously. It's highly transmissible, and it's causing a new wave of cases. It accounts for over 80 percent of all COVID-19 cases in the United States today. Experts tell us that we're going to see these cases rise in the weeks ahead, a largely preventable tragedy that will get worse before it gets better.</p>, <p>What's different about this surge from previous ones is, we have the tools to prevent this rise in cases from shutting down our businesses, our schools, our society as we saw—what happened last year. And while cases are on the rise, it's important to note we've not seen a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most areas of the country.</p>, <p>That's because 165 million Americans are fully vaccinated, including 80 percent of the most vulnerable Americans—our seniors. The best line of defense against the Delta—the virus is the vaccine. It's as simple as that. Period. The vaccine. I want to be crystal clear about what's happening in the country today: We have a pandemic of the unvaccinated.</p>, <p>Now, I know there's a lot of misinformation out there, so here are the facts: If you're vaccinated, you are highly unlikely to get COVID-19. And even if you do, the chances are you won't show any symptoms; and if you do, they'll most likely be very mild.</p>, <p>Vaccinated people almost never are hospitalized with COVID-19. In fact, according to one recent study, 95 percent of overall COVID-19 hospitalizations are among those not fully vaccinated. And the data shows that virtually all the cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19 are from the unvaccinated population.</p>, <p>Last month, a study showed that over 99 percent of COVID-19 deaths have among—have been among the unvaccinated people. Ninety-nine percent. That means, if you're unvaccinated, you are much more likely to, one, get COVID-19; two, get hospitalized; and, three, die if you get it.</p>, <p>This is a tragedy. People are dying and will die who don't have to die. The data is absolutely clear: As I've said, we have a pandemic of the unvaccinated.</p>, <p>Think of it this way: A hundred and ninety-one million Americans have gotten at least one shot, including 70 percent of adults over the age of 18. A hundred and sixty-five million Americans are fully vaccinated, but about ninety million Americans are eligible for vaccines and still haven't gotten their first shot.</p>, <p>You know, I think there's a clear link between the lowest vaccinated—I know—I don't think, actually—the lowest vaccinated States and the States with the highest case rates.</p>, <p>This past week, the most vaccinated State in America, Vermont, has seen just five new cases—five—per day of COVID-19 for every 100,000 people who live in that State. That means, on any given day, only 30 people in the entire State of Vermont got COVID-19. Nearby Maine, which has vaccinated almost 80 percent of their adults, has seen just six new cases per 100,000.</p>, <p>But the States with the lowest vaccination rates are seeing 10 to 20 times as many new cases per 100,000 people. It's moving like wildfire through the unvaccinated community. And it's heartbreaking, particularly because it's preventable.</p>, <p>That's why we're doing everything we can to get more people vaccinated. And we're seeing real results. In the past 2 weeks, we have seen a 55-percent increase in the average number of new people getting vaccinated every day. In the last 7 days alone, nearly 3 million Americans have gotten their first shot. That's the highest 7-day total in a month.</p>, <p>Importantly, over the past 2 weeks, the eight States with the highest current case rates have seen a doubling of the number of people newly vaccinated each day. The message is getting through, apparently.</p>, <p>Louisiana has seen a 212 percent increase in the average number of newly vaccinated people in that State per day, going from 3,600 to over 11,000 people vaccinated per day. Arkansas is up 99 percent. Mississippi is up 125 percent. Alabama is up 186 percent, going from 3,200 to 9,150 people vaccinated per day. This will make a big difference.</p>, <p>These are encouraging signs. We have to continue our aggressive efforts to vaccinate the unvaccinated. Last week, I announced additional steps to incentivize Americans to get vaccinated, including calling on States to offer $100 for anyone willing to step up and get a vaccination shot. You know, and already Minnesota and New Mexico have done that. And North Carolina announced its hundred-day incentive—its $100 incentive today.</p>, <p>Places that have offered the hundred thousand—the hundred thousand dollars—[<i>laughter</i>]—the hundred dollars—that'd be really good. I'd go back and get vaccinated three times. [<i>Laughter</i>] But all kidding aside, offered the $100 to get vaccination have seen an uptick of 25 percent of daily vaccination rates.</p>, <p>We also announced that small and medium-sized businesses will be fully reimbursed for offering paid time off for their employees to get vaccinated and for them to take a child or a parent to get vaccinated.</p>, <p>And I announced some tough, sometimes unpopular steps to keep people safe and our economy strong. All Federal workers must report their vaccination status or be subject to strict requirements. Any Federal worker who does not attest to their vaccination status or is not vaccinated will be required to mask no matter where they work, test once to twice a week, socially distance, and generally will not be allowed to travel for work.</p>, <p>I directed my administration to take steps to apply similar standards to all Federal contractors. If you want to do business with the Federal Government, get your workers vaccinated.</p>, <p>And I also directed the Pentagon to look at adding COVID-19 to the list of vaccinations that are required for our troops, because others are required. I approved the Department of Veterans Affairs to require doctors, nurses, and other health care workers who care for our veterans to be vaccinated.</p>, <p>And the good news is that now many are following the Federal Government's lead. In the past several days, States and local officials have come out to impose similar vaccination mandates.</p>, <p>And the private sector is stepping up as well. Even Fox has vaccination requirements. I want to thank Walmart, Google, Netflix, Disney, Tyson Foods for their recent actions requiring vaccination for employees. Look, I know this isn't easy, but I will have their backs and the backs of other private and public sector leaders if they take such steps.</p>, <p>But others have declined to step up. I find it disappointing. And worst of all, some State officials are passing laws or signing orders that forbid people from doing the right thing. As of now, seven States not only ban mask mandates, but also ban them in their school districts, even for young children who cannot get vaccinated. Some States have even banned businesses and universities from requiring workers and students to be masked or vaccinated.</p>, <p>And the most extreme of those measures is like the one in Texas that say State universities or community colleges could be fined if it allows a teacher to ask her unvaccinated students to wear a mask.</p>, <p>What are we doing? COVID-19 is a national challenge, and we must come together—we have to come together—all of us together, as a country, to solve it.</p>, <p>Make no mistake: The—the excuse me—the escalation of cases is particularly concentrated in States with low vaccination rates. Just two States, Florida and Texas, account for one third of all new COVID-19 cases in the entire country. Just two States.</p>, <p>Look, we need leadership from everyone. And if some Governors aren't willing to do the right thing to beat this pandemic, then they should allow businesses and universities who want to do the right thing to be able to do it. I say to these Governors, ""Please, help."" But if you aren't going to help, at least get out of the way of the people who are trying to do the right thing. Use your power to save lives.</p>, <p>I've made it our first and top priority to have a vaccine available for every single American from the day I got elected. That was my priority. And let me be clear: We have a supply for every single American, and that will never change.</p>, <p>At the same time, it's also in our national interest to share some of our vaccines with the world, which gets me to the second thing I want to discuss today. From the beginning of my Presidency, I've been very clear eyed that we need to attack this virus globally, not just at home, because it's in America's self-interest to do so.</p>, <p>The virus knows no boundaries. You can't build a wall high enough to keep it out. There is no wall high enough or ocean wide enough to keep us safe from a vaccination in other—from the COVID-19 in other countries.</p>, <p>In fact, just like the original virus that caused COVID-19, the Delta variant came from abroad. As long as the virus continues to rage outside the United States, potentially more dangerous variants could arrive at our shores again.</p>, <p>And we know that COVID-19 in other countries stifles economic growth, disrupts supply chains, risks instability and weakness of governments. And as we've seen in the United States, the key to growing economies is to vaccinate people. So just as the American economy is recovering, it's in all of our interests to have global—the global economy begin to recover as well.</p>, <p>This is about our values. We value inherent dignity of all people—the inherent dignity of everyone. In times of trouble, Americans reach out to offer a helping hand. That's who we are. And I've said before: In this fight against COVID-19, the United States is committed to be the arsenal of vaccines, just as we were the arsenal of democracy during World War II.</p>, <p>And we're backing up that commitment. We have contributed more than any other nation to COVAX, the collective global efforts delivering COVID-19 vaccines across the world. We have supported manufacturing efforts abroad through our partnerships with Japan, India, Australia, known as ""the Quad.""</p>, <p>During my trip to Europe in June, I announced that the United States would purchase a groundbreaking 500 million doses of Pfizer and then donate them—those doses—nearly—to nearly a hundred low- and middle-income countries who don't have the vaccine. Those doses will start to ship at the end of this month. We also announced that we'd donate 80 million doses of our own vaccine to supply the world, which has already begun.</p>, <p>And today I have an important update. We've already exceeded 80 million doses that have been—gone out. As of today, the United States has shipped over 110 million doses of U.S. vaccines to 65 countries that are among the hardest hit in the world. Let me say it again: As of today, we have shipped over 110 million doses to 65 nations.</p>, <p>According to the United Nations, this is more than the donations of all 24 countries that have donated any vaccine to other countries, including China and Russia—all those nations combined. These vaccine donations from America are free. We're not selling them.</p>, <p>There are no demands, no conditions, no coercion attached. And there is no favoritism and no strings attached. We're doing this to save lives and to end this pandemic. That's it. In fact, we're donating vaccines to countries that have real issues—we have real issues with.</p>, <p>And we'll continue to give tens of millions of the doses away across the summer and work to increase U.S. manufacturing and manufacturing of vaccines around the world as well.</p>, <p>And it's not just vaccines. We are continuing to provide countries with—in need—with more testing, protective equipment, and personnel to stem the surge of the virus. We've done it in India and elsewhere.</p>, <p>Let me close with this. I've said before: In the race for the 21st century between democracies and autocracies, we need to prove that democracies can deliver.</p>, <p>And the democracies of the world are looking to America to lead again in two ways: first, to demonstrate we can control this virus at home; and second, to show we can help address it around the world.</p>, <p>Vaccinate America and help vaccinate the world, that's how we're about to beat this thing. We're always going to have enough doses for every American who wants one. Our work in donating vaccines to the world is about America following through on our promises and delivering what we say we'll deliver.</p>, <p>It's showing how American science and technology, American businesses and academia, and our Government can all work together. Above all, it's proving democracies can deliver and, yet again, that America is back leading the world—not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.</p>, <p>We still have a lot of work to do. So if you're unvaccinated, please, please, please get the shot.</p>, <p>But just don't take it from me. Just read the news. Listen to the voices of the unvaccinated patients in the hospital. They are spending [sending]* the most powerful message to their families and everyone around the world—a powerful message to everybody. As they're lying in bed, many dying from COVID-19, they're asking, ""Doc, can I get the vaccine?"" The doctors have to look them in the eye and say: ""No, sorry. It's too late.""</p>, <p>Right now too many people are dying or watching a loved one dying and saying, ""If I just got vaccinated. If I just""—folks, this is isn't about politics. The virus doesn't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican. This is about life and death. Life and death.</p>, <p>I can't say it any more plainly than this: The vaccine saves lives, and it could save yours or your child's.</p>, <p>You know, I know we can do this. We're the United States of America. We're prepared like never before. We have the tools and the resources to save lives at home and around the world.</p>, <p>This is who we are. This is what we do. This is why there's no nation like us on Earth.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.</p>, <p>And I'll take a few questions.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Governor Andrew M. Cuomo of New York </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, I have a question for you on coronavirus, but first I'd like to start with the news of the day, given, back in March, you said that if the investigation confirmed the allegations against Governor Cuomo, then he should resign. So will you now call on him to resign, given the investigators said the 11 women were credible?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I stand by that statement.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Are you now calling on him to resign?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>And if he doesn't resign, do you believe he should be impeached and removed from office?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Let's take one thing at a time here. I think he should resign.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Do you think——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I understand that the State legislature may decide to impeach. I don't know that for a fact; I've not read all that data.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>And he's using a photo of you embracing him in his self-defense to say that these are commonplace kind of embraces that he made in the allegations against him. Do you condone that?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Look, I'm not going to flyspeck this. I'm sure there are some embraces that were totally innocent, but apparently, the attorney general decided there were things that weren't.</p>, <p><i>Eviction Moratorium/Centers of Disease Control and Prevention </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>And on coronavirus, if I could ask you a question about the evictions.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] Why don't you come up and take the platform?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>[<i>Laughter</i>] No, thank you. On the evictions and the moratorium that lapsed on Saturday night: What is your strategy to prevent potentially millions of people from being evicted from their homes, given what we are told your administration is considering—a targeted moratorium—is likely to face legal challenges?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Any call for a moratorium based on the Supreme Court recent decision is likely to face obstacles. I've indicated to the CDC I'd like them to look at other alternatives than the one that is in power—in existence, which the Court has declared they're not going to allow to continue. And the CDC will have something to announce to you in the next hour to 2 hours.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Global Coronavirus Vaccine Distribution/U.S. Contribution to Global Vaccination Effort </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>President Biden, on overseas coronavirus vaccines: Should other high-income countries follow the lead of the United States and increase donations to low- and middle-income countries?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I think those countries that have been able to cover their population and have the ability to provide either dollars and/or vaccine for the 100 or so poor nations that need help should do so. We had that discussion at the G-7. A number of those countries said they were going to do that. Some have followed through.</p>, <p>The point I was making is, though, I've kept the commitment—we've kept the commitment—that we would do what we said, which is more than all the rest of the countries combined thus far.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Prevention Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, do you believe that Governor DeSantis and Governor Abbott are personally making decisions that are harming their own citizens?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I believe the results of their decisions are not good for their constituents. And it's clear to me and to most of the medical experts that the decisions being made, like not allowing mask mandates in school and the like, are bad health policy—bad health policy.</p>, <p><i>Mexico-U.S. Border Security/Unaccompanied Minors at the Southern Border </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, I have a question about something that you just said.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm sure you do.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>[<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you. You just said there is no wall high enough and no ocean wide enough to protect us from the virus. So what is the thinking behind letting untested and unvaccinated migrants cross the southern border into U.S. cities in record numbers?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> There is—what we're doing—we have not withdrawn the order that is sometimes critical—criticized—saying that unvaccinated people should be—go back across the border.</p>, <p>But unaccompanied children is a different story, because there's—that's the most humane thing to do is to test them and to treat them and not send them back alone.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>And the follow-up would be that——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Governor Andrew M. Cuomo of New York </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, have you spoken with Governor Cuomo today?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I have not.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Vaccine Verification Requirements </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>And then, one other question on the virus. You just said we have to continue our aggressive efforts to get the unvaccinated vaccinated. Other countries have found a lot of success in requiring vaccines in public places. New York City just announced today that they'll require vaccines for restaurants and gyms. Do you think more cities and States should institute rules like that?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I do.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>And are you going to publicly call on them? Should they institute a vaccine passport-type system, or it's up to each city and State to figure that out on their own?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm sorry. What did you say?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Do you think that they should institute a vaccine passport-type system or some sort of verification to use public spaces?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I don't think they need to do that. I think they just need to give the authority of those restaurants or businesses to say, ""In order to come in, you have to give proof that you've been vaccinated or you can't come in.""</p>, <p>I'll take a couple more questions.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Governor Andrew M. Cuomo of New York </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President can I ask you about news of the day, one more on Governor Cuomo? You're calling for him to resign now. My question is: Do you think he should be prosecuted? And what is your message to the women who have now accused him of sexually harassing them and abusing them?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Look, what I said was: If the investigation of the attorney general concluded that the allegations were correct, that—back in March—that I would recommend he resign. That's what I'm doing today. I've not read the report. I don't know the detail of it. All I know is the end result.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> So, Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>A follow-up on COVID, sir——</p>, <p><i>Legal Restrictions on the Eviction Moratorium/Federal Assistance to State and Local Governments </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, a question on COVID, if I could, really quickly. It's the eviction moratorium. Can you explain a little bit more why it took so long to have a possible eviction moratorium be put into place? There was—there are people—this expired on Saturday. I'm wondering—there are folks who are saying it took too long for this to happen.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, look, the Court's made it clear that the existing moratorium was not constitutional; it wouldn't stand. And they made that clear back in, I guess, July 15 or July 18.</p>, <p>In the meantime, what I've been pushing for and calling for is we have billions of dollars that were given to States to provide for rent and utilities for those people who can't afford to stay in their homes because they can't—an apartment—they can't pay their rent. And so we're urging them to distribute those funds to the landlords. I believe that would take care of the vast majority of what needs to be done to keep people in their—in their home—in their apartments now.</p>, <p>And so that's what we're working on. Some States have done it, and some communities have, but they have not. The money is there. It's not—we don't have to send it out. It's been sent out to the States and counties—billions of dollars—for the express purpose of providing for back-rent and rent for the people who are in the middle of this crisis. And that's there; that's what we're pushing now. And we've been pushing that. That's the immediate thing to do.</p>, <p>I'll take one more question.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>U.S. Delegation to Brazil/Global Coronavirus Vaccine Distribution/U.S. Contribution to Global Vaccination Effort </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, thank you so much. There was an expectation that you would be announcing new vaccines to the world today—a new—other than the ones you promised. Are you ready to send more vaccines to the world?</p>, <p>And there is a delegation from the White House going to Brazil tomorrow. Are they bringing more vaccines? Are they announcing more vaccines to Brazil?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No—are they announcing more vaccines overall?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Overall. And then, to Brazil—for the delegation coming to Brazil tomorrow—will you be bringing vaccines?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> The answer is: I don't know whether the delegation going physically has vaccines with them. We have provided vaccines to——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Well, no. Are they bringing the announcement? Are they announcing there?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, no, there's a need for several billion doses around the world. We have committed to over a half a billion doses. And we're trying to provide for more and provide for the capacity of countries like India to be able to produce the vaccine themselves. And we're helping them do that. That's what we're doing now.</p>, <p>And we're trying to—we're—and by the way, it's free. We're not charging anybody anything. And we're trying to do as much as we possibly can.</p>, <p>Thank you all very much.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Sir, a quick one on COVID, sir, what else is on the table——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>[<i>Inaudible</i>]—on the Government?</p>, <p><i>Legal Restrictions on the Eviction Moratorium/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Federal Assistance to State and Local Governments </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, we're learning that your administration is about to announce a new partial eviction moratorium, COVID related. Can you tell us any more about that? And are you sure it's going to pass Supreme Court muster?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> The answer is twofold. One, I've sought out constitutional scholars to determine what is the best possibility that would come from executive action, or the CDC's judgment, what could they do that was most likely to pass muster, constitutionally.</p>, <p>The bulk of the constitutional scholarship says that it's not likely to pass constitutional muster. Number one. But there are several key scholars who think that it may and it's worth the effort. But the present—you could not—the Court has already ruled on the present eviction moratorium.</p>, <p>So I think what you're going to see, and I—look, I want to make it clear: I told you I would not tell the Justice Department or the medical experts, the scientists what they should say or do. So I don't want to get ahead.</p>, <p>The CDC has to make the—I asked the CDC to go back and consider other options that may be available to them. You're going to hear from them what those other options are.</p>, <p>I have been informed they're about to make a judgment as to potential other options. Whether that option will pass constitutional measure with this administration, I can't tell you. I don't know. There are a few scholars who say it will, and others who say it's not likely to.</p>, <p>But, at a minimum, by the time it gets litigated, it will probably give some additional time while we're getting that $45 billion out to people who are, in fact, behind in the rent and don't have the money. That's why it was passed in the act that we passed in the beginning of my administration, and it went to the States.</p>, <p>We were under the impression that the States were moving this money out relatively rapidly. So, for example, if I'm in an apartment—if you're in an apartment, and you're behind on 4 or 5 months' rent, and let's say your rent is $2,000 a month—I'm just making this up out of the blue—and you're behind, you need $10,000 to catch up. Hardly anybody has that $10,000. But there is money that the States have that can give to the landlord that $10,000, to the back-rent.</p>, <p>The future rent, it's unlikely—at least the hope is, since they have been made whole to that point—that they'd be inclined—because the economy is growing—inclined not to throw someone out in the street; keep that person—no guarantee—keep that person in the apartment, keep these kids in the same school district, and count on being able to have the opportunity for that person to be able, who may now be employed, to pay their rent.</p>, <p>But, in the meantime, I've asked, isn't there any safety valve we can put in? And it's the one I explained to you. Again, CDC will announce that and the details of exactly how it works. I'm not telling—I told them I want them to take a look. I didn't tell them what they had to do.</p>, <p>And my hope is, it's going to be a new moratorium that in some way—and I'm not going to announce it now; I'll let them announce it—in some way covers close to 90 percent of the American people who are renters. And so that's all I can tell you now.</p>, <p>Thank you very much.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Why not a hundred percent? What's the difference?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Because it's a—[<i>laughter</i>]. Let them explain that to you. Okay? I don't want to get too far ahead.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, is COVAX doing enough to get shots in arms?</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Prevention Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Why not call Governor DeSantis, Mr. President?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] To say ""happy birthday""? What? I mean——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>To deliver the message that you seem to be delivering today about ""get out of the way.""</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> He knows the message. He knows the message. We had a little discussion when I was down there. He knows the message.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>What did he say to you in that discussion?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] See you all later.</p>]"
13,7,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks During a Meeting With Latino Community Leaders and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-during-meeting-with-latino-community-leaders-and-exchange-with-reporters,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Okay. Well, everybody, welcome. Today I have the privilege of meeting with Latino leaders to discuss a bunch of key issues that affect the community; the progress we're making against the pandemic; historic and economic recovery we're under—that's undergoing—we're undergoing; and immigration and voting rights, which are critical.</p>, <p>Latino leaders have been essential to helping us get the country vaccinated, with 70 percent of all adult Americans receiving at least one shot. The vaccines work. Even as cases go up due to the highly transmissible disease, the Delta variant, we're not seeing a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most of the country because of the vaccinations. This is an epidemic of the unvaccinated—a pandemic of the unvaccinated.</p>, <p>But we need everyone to get vaccinated in this pandemic. And it's critical to keeping the economy strong. And in 6 months, we're seeing the fastest job growth of any point in any administration in history from the beginning of their administration and the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years.</p>, <p>And we have an opportunity to make historic investments in infrastructure and in American families and finally to build an economy that deals everybody in. I've been saying from the beginning when I announced that I'm tired of trickle down. It doesn't work very well. But when you build from the bottom up and the middle out, everybody does well, including the wealthy. That's what this is all about.</p>, <p>And so creating millions of good-paying jobs in every community and—including Latino neighborhoods—delivering affordable child and—care and paid leave and universal pre-K, 2 years of community college.</p>, <p>You know, today marks, as we all know—no one knows this better than this community—2-year—2 years of—since the shooting in El Paso. And all of us have, in our personal lives, lost people unexpectedly. Most of us have. We know how devastating it is, particularly one that was born out of such hatred.</p>, <p>But you know, I did a piece—Jill and I did a piece for the El Paso Times, but I realized after it was published that I didn't talk about an aspect that is really important: There were 236 people who were wounded. How are they doing? The trauma. The equivalent of posttraumatic stress that comes from these kinds of things. I—and the need for—and I hope we'll—we can talk about it a little bit later as well—is their need for mental health services and a whole range of things that affect not only them but their families when they've survived.</p>, <p>But, to the families who have lost loved ones, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, Jill and send our love, as all of you do, I know. But I know, you know, these anniversaries are—should be celebrated in a sense of recognize—so we see things don't happen again. But, you know, they're terrible for the victims and the survivors because it brings back everything like it happened the very moment ago. And I—it takes enormous courage for people to respond that way.</p>, <p>You know, and I know how hard these anniversaries are. As I said, no matter how much time has passed, it brings it all back like it happened that second. And the El Paso community—you know, they continue to show their courage and the resilience. But to all Americans, this tragedy reminds us of the unfinished work to heal—and I know I got criticized for running on it, but I really mean it—heal the soul of this country. We have to return to some decency and honor, and I just—anyway.</p>, <p>The gunman targeted people and the diversity of El Paso and our most deeply held American values. And you know, we all act together to counter what is basically domestic terrorism, domestic violence, domestic extremism, and end the scourge of gun violence in America. We can't end it, but we sure can make a big difference than what it is now. And so I continue to do everything in my power to do that.</p>, <p>The most lethal terrorist threat to our homeland in recent years is domestic terrorism—domestic terrorism rooted in White supremacy. We're going to have to stand united against this violence because it just spills over to all communities.</p>, <p>And my administration is carrying out the country's first-ever comprehensive effort to tackle the threat of domestic terrorism, from reducing online radicalization to disrupting networks that inspire violence and providing resources to communities to build up some resilience.</p>, <p>And I'm going to continue to fight this for more commonsense gun laws. And we're going to continue to call on Congress to take action, which they've been reluctant to do. That includes a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines like the one used in El Paso. The idea anybody needs, for a pistol and/or a rifle—anyone needs 10, 12, 20, 30, 100 rounds in a rifle is just—it just makes no sense at all. Zero. Doesn't violate anybody's Second Amendment rights to say, ""You can't do that."" But it just has to stop.</p>, <p>And that includes using my existing authority, which I have, to—from reining in ""ghost guns"" and—to investing in community policing and community violence intervention, to having—bringing in psychologists and social workers into the police forces to help.</p>, <p>And you know, I look forward to hearing from this group about all of these issues and a lot more. And—but, with that, we're going to discuss a wide range of issues, all of us here tonight—today. And I'm looking forward to it.</p>, <p>So thank you all. Thank you, press, for being here.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Containment Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, should Andrew Cuomo resign, sir?

13,8,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks at a Democratic National Committee Virtual Fundraiser,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-democratic-national-committee-virtual-fundraiser-0,"[<p>Thank you, Tom. Thanks for that introduction and for your generous support. And I want to thank you all. And, Jamie, for your support as well and being willing to take on the chairmanship.</p>, <p>You know, I didn't have it like you did, but I remember when my dad—when things died up in Scranton; the coal dried up. He wasn't a coalminer; my great grandfather was. But he wasn't a coalminer, but everything else dried up. And he said—I remember him going home to my grandpop, who had four sons and a daughter, and asking him is it okay if his wife—my mother, Jean—and the three kids move in with him for a year or so until he got straightened away down in Northern Delaware, a little town called Claymont.</p>, <p>And so that—and he said—I'll never forget it. He said: ""I'll come home every weekend, Joey. Every weekend. There's only 147—157 miles."" And I thought, ""My God, that's a million miles."" I was going—I was in third grade, going into fourth. And you know, it's a—they used to have an expression—and that's never—and this is the God's truth. We got down to Delaware, as he worked his way through, after 5 years, being able to buy a small three-bedroom home. He used to say: ""Joey, a job is a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your pride. It's about your place in the community. It's about your ability to look your kids in the eye. It's about your dignity."" And so it's much—so much more.</p>, <p>And so, you know, when I ran with your help—and I couldn't have made it, with all the help of people on this line—you know, we are part of something special because you allowed me to compete. We—I think we put together one of the most consequential campaigns in modern history. Because it really was, in my view, a battle for the soul of the Nation: basic decency, building the middle class from the bottom up and the middle out, rather than waiting for everything to trickle down.</p>, <p>And a lot of you are very successful people on the line, but you shared that view and you gave me the money and contributions to be able to complete—I say—I should say ""compete."" And so we're bound together in one of the most consequential first 6 months in the history of this country. Not because of me, it's about the country; it's about people stepping up.</p>, <p>Think about the last 6 months. The American Rescue Plan. We delivered shots in arms of millions and millions of people. Checks in pockets to hundreds of millions of Americans. And maybe the thing that I'm proudest of: We got the biggest middle class tax cut of all time with the help of the—cutting the child poverty in half through the childcare—the child tax credit.</p>, <p>And 165 million Americans are fully vaccinated. You've got over 190 that have at least one shot—one shot. It's the fastest job growth in the first 4 months of any previous Presidency. Period. And a projected economic growth at nearly 7 percent, the highest in four decades.</p>, <p>And last week, they—the infrastructure plan that I introduced when I was running and put together with a bipartisan group—I had to make some compromises, but it's going to make a gigantic difference.</p>, <p>For example, it's going to transform the economy. It's over a trillion dollars. It's going to eliminate all lead pipes in America so people have decent drinking water. Build roads up to—up to snuff so we build them back to, you know, making sure that they are where the environment is now—not—we have to build them back better. Childcare. The caring economy. The eldercare. The things that the American public wants most.</p>, <p>And look—and delivering high-speed internet to every American. Delivering clean water, as I said, to every American. Building more resilient power grids. Installing electric vehicle charging stations, over 500,000 of them. The largest investment in public transit in rail since the creation of Amtrak 50 years ago.</p>, <p>What it's all about is my dad's notion; it's about creating good-paying American jobs for millions of middle class people and the working class people. And it's about our economic competitiveness.</p>, <p>You know, as a—as the Democratic Party, I think we're going to be able to say, going into these off-year elections, as the chairman said, that we can deliver. We can deliver for the American people. We can bring the country together. We can make a difference in their lives.</p>, <p>And you know, it's about including everyone this time around—Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American communities—because I said the administration and our efforts would reflect what the country looked like. And as I said, we're in the race for the 21st-century economy and the rest of the world is not hanging around and waiting. We have to move fast.</p>, <p>And the bottom line, for me, is this: that we're signaling to the rest of the world and to ourselves that we can function, we can deliver, we can do significant things. And we've got a lot more to do as we invest in physical infrastructure, also invest in human infrastructure, childcare, paid leave, universal pre-K through 2 years of—and 2 years of community college.</p>, <p>When I hear about, ""Well, you know, that's not investing""—well, let me tell you, when I was Vice President, I was asked to do a survey along the Secretary of Commerce of the 500 CEOs of the five—Fortune 500 to see what their greatest needs are. We got to 340-some. You know what they said, almost to a person? They said, ""We need a better educated public."" Well, they're not educating the public. And so what are we going to do?</p>, <p>If I said to you tomorrow, ""We can maintain exorbitant tax cuts for the superwealthy""—and many of you are—""or we can make sure that every kid, starting at age 3, 4, and 5, is in preschool, not daycare, and they have access to community college so we're the best educated public in the world,"" which do you think is going to best promote the country's growth? You know what it is.</p>, <p>So look, let me conclude. I'm taking too much time. I want to meet each one of you. But look, we need—the single most important thing that we have to do is we have to protect the voting system, protect the sacred right to vote. It's under assault in ways I haven't seen in my entire career. And I was the guy who was able to get the Voting Rights extended—Act extended 25 years before, when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. And it wasn't until the Supreme Court came along and said, ""No, no, don't need it anymore.""</p>, <p>It's about who gets to vote and whether the vote counts and who gets to count that vote. We have a system that does both those things with independence and integrity. But what Republicans want to do is say a political party gets to decide if a vote counts. It's outrageous. We're going to fight like hell so that doesn't happen. That's one of the most important things we can do.</p>, <p>There's a lot of work ahead. It's not going to be easy. But I'm going to need you to do it. The DNC is going to need you. And because—here's the deal: We won in 2020 as a unified party. And as we look to 2022, we need to stay unified. The question the American people are going to be asking is whether we're helping them and their families? And do we understand what they're going through, understand their problem? Can we deliver for them?</p>, <p>You know, as Democrats, we have to show that we understand, number one; we're delivering, number two; and we're keeping our promise. We just have to keep making our case—just as the Republican Party today offers nothing but fear, lies, and broken promises. We have to keep cutting through the Republican fog—that the government isn't the problem, and show that we, the people—we, the people, are always the solution.</p>, <p>We're the most unique country in the history of the world. You've heard me say this before. We're the only country that's organized based on an idea—on an idea, not religion, ethnicity, geography—on an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are critical equal, endowed—you know the rest.</p>, <p>But you have to be able to vote. It's the single most important thing we could do. And we're going to have to win races up and down the ticket. You know, in 2018, I was out of office, but I campaigned in 58 districts—congressional districts—they said we couldn't win. We won back the United States Congress.</p>, <p>And look, if we make the right decision in the next few years, in 50 years people are going to look back and say, ""This was the moment that America won the 21st century."" I really believe that. But we can't do it without you. You know, we have to prove that democracies can work.</p>, <p>I'll conclude by saying—and the press on the line has heard me say this before—that Xi Jinping, and—who I've met hours and hours with—over 25 hours—24 hours alone. When I won, he called me to congratulate me. We spent 2 hours and, I think, almost 25 minutes on the phone.</p>, <p>He believes, along with other autocrats, that in the modern world, things are changing so rapidly, so quickly that democracies can't get their acts together and unite to compete with autocratic governments. He truly believes that. And he's decided that they're going to be the most powerful military force in the world and the largest economy and the most organized economy in the world by 2045.</p>, <p>We have got to demonstrate that democracies can work and protect them. And I think it's going to impact on our influence around the world more than anything.</p>, <p>That's why we have to do some of this stuff together with others to get it done—get it done. And I'm convinced there's not much we can't do. I think the country is ready. And because of you, I think we're going to be able to get it done.</p>, <p>But I want to thank you all. Thank you for everything you've done. And you know, we've got to prove we can make democracy work again. That's what it's about.</p>, <p>So God bless you all for what you've done and going to do, and may God protect our troops.</p>]"

14,0,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks During a Meeting With Cuban American Leaders and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-during-meeting-with-cuban-american-leaders-and-exchange-with-reporters,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Well, I'm honored to welcome members of the Cuban American community and Senator Menendez, Senator [Congressman]* Meeks to discuss how the United States is going to continue to stand with the Cuban people, who have suffered decades, decades under a failed communist regime.</p>, <p>Earlier this month, Cubans took to the street in a historic demonstration of the will of the people of Cuba. The regime responded with violence and repression, mass detentions, sham trials, and people disappearing who—for—have spoken out. Just disappearing. Family members, I'm told, are not able—have no idea where their family members are back in Cuba. And in a brazen violation of the rights of the Cuban people.</p>, <p>The Cuban Americans are hurting. They're hurting because their loved ones are suffering. And it's, quite frankly, intolerable. So I want the Cuban Americans to know that we—all around this table and myself included—see your pain, we hear your voices, and we hear the cries of freedom coming from the island.</p>, <p>The United States is taking a concerted action to bolster the cause of the Cuban people. We've brought to bear the strength of our diplomacy, rallying nations to speak out and increase pressure on the regime. And we're holding the regime accountable.</p>, <p>Last week, we sanctioned the head of Cuban Armed Forces and the Government—a Government entity called the ""Black Berets"" for their involvement in suppressing protesters. And today we are adding sanctions against the Revolutionary National Police, as well as individual sanctions against the chief and deputy chief—the chief and deputy chief. And we're going to continue to add sanctions on individuals that carry out the regime's abuses.</p>, <p>At the same time, we're increasing direct support for the Cuban people by pursuing every option available to provide internet access to help the Cuban bypass—the Cuban people bypass the censorship that's being mandatorily imposed. You always know something is not going well when the—a country will not allow—will not allow—their people to be engaged in—be on the internet and being able to make their case known around the world.</p>, <p>And we're expanding our assistance to political prisoners and dissidents.</p>, <p>And the direct State—and I've directed the State Department and the Treasury Department to provide me, within 1 month, recommendations of how to maximize the flow of remittances to the Cuban people, without the Cuban military taking their cut.</p>, <p>And we're working to increase U.S. staffing at our Embassy while prioritizing the safety of our personnel.</p>, <p>So we've got a lot to discuss with this group. So we've got—and mostly, I'm here to listen. I want to know what their ideas are. And you are some of the best experts on the issue.</p>, <p>The first person to bring this to my attention and to make sure that we were on top of this was Senator Menendez. And we think that—you know, the American—the Cuban American people are actually the best ambassadors for the Cuban people.</p>, <p>And so my administration is going to make sure that their voices are included and uplifted at every step of the way. And we're going to get down to business.</p>, <p>So thank you all for bothering to come in. I appreciate it.</p>, <p><i>U.S. Sanctions Against Cuba </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Will there be more sanctions coming out, Mr. President? Or is that it today?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I beg your pardon?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>I said: Will there be more sanctions against Cuba coming up, or are you stopping with what you did today?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> We are—there will be more, unless there's some drastic change in Cuba, which I don't anticipate.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>]"
14,1,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks During a Virtual Meeting With Governors on Wildfire Prevention and Response Efforts,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-during-virtual-meeting-with-governors-wildfire-prevention-and-response-efforts,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Jay, you're beginning to convince the American people there is a thing called ""climate crisis."" About time. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Governor Jay R. Inslee of Washington.</i> Indeed. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, thank you all for being here. I'm going to make a brief statement here, and then we'll get to ask the Vice President to say a few words, get to some questions, and we'll get down to business, if that's okay with you all.</p>, <p>You know, 1 month ago, we convened the first of what will be a regular Presidential briefing on wildfire preparedness. And we're joined by many of the Governors who—we were joined by many of the Governors who are with us today, as well as experts from across the administration and leaders from the electric utility sector.</p>, <p>I said then that the threat of Western wildfires this year was as severe as it's ever been. And in the past month, we've sadly seen the truth of that being played out. Since our last meeting, the number of large, uncontained wildfires has nearly doubled to 66—66 of those fires. And the number of firefighters on the job to battle them has tripled. Over 3.4 million acres have already burned.</p>, <p>In Oregon, the Bootleg Fire has destroyed more than 400 structures, including more than 160 homes. In California, the Dixie Fire has grown to over 220,000 acres and our firefighters are working in really rugged and dangerous conditions and terrain. The number of States are experiencing the impacts of smoke from these fires, degrading their air quality, not just where the fires are burning, but all the States moving east—not all, but most.</p>, <p>In short, we've got big, complex wildfires burning across multiple areas. And despite the incredible—and I'm not—this is not being solicitous—the incredible bravery and heroism of our firefighters, our resources are already being stretched to keep up. We need more help, particularly when we also factor in the additional nationwide challenges of pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and our ongoing efforts to fight COVID.</p>, <p>We've had a few COVID clusters at our fire camps, which further limits resources. It's just one more reason why it's so darn important that everyone get vaccinated, I might add.</p>, <p>Sadly, we've also lost two brave firefighters in the last month in a plane crash in Arizona, and five were seriously injured last week battling Devil's Creek Fire in Montana.</p>, <p>It's—to state the obvious, and you Governors know it better than anybody—it is really, really dangerous work, and it takes incredible bravery to do it. And these heroes deserve to be paid—and paid well—for their work. That's why, last month, I was able to announce—and it's not paying that well, in my view, to be honest with you—immediate action to make all Federal firefighters making at least $15 an hour. I think they deserve more than that.</p>, <p>We're also working with Congress to make sure that our firefighters are paid better permanently. Permanently. So far, FEMA has approved 20 Fire Management Assistance Grants totaling up to $100 million to help States pay for the cost of fighting these fires.</p>, <p>We're also working with FEMA and the Defense Logistical Agency to get ahead of this emergency supply chain challenges. And we still have some supply chain challenges relating to hoses and a number of other things.</p>, <p>We're trapped—we've tapped additional aircraft from the Department of Defense to aid in the fire detection and firefighting. We also welcome the support of our allies, from Australia, for example, sending a large air tanker to—which it's going to begin flying missions this week.</p>, <p>And last month, I also noted that the EPA would be launching an upgrade app for mobile phones to easily share location-specific information with the public about the effects of fire and smoke on air quality for them. It's now even more important, because smoke from many of these fires burning in the West and along the Canadian border is affecting air quality in States across the country.</p>, <p>As of today, the upgrade app—the upgrade AirNow app is live and ready for use. Folks in affected areas should download this important tool as quickly as possible.</p>, <p>I also encourage our States and county leaders to continue partnering with FEMA, as many of the leaders on the scene today are leveraging our public alert and warning systems to communicate information directly and quickly about—to the public about wildfires, evacuations, power outages, and more.</p>, <p>I know several of the Governors' States have used this system recently and send—to send warnings of evacuation orders, and it has undoubtedly helped people and, we don't know for certain, but likely saved some lives.</p>, <p>But we're in for a long fight yet this year, and the only way we're going to meet those challenges is by working together. Wildfires are a problem for all of us, and we have to stay closely coordinated in doing everything we can for our people.</p>, <p>That's why I asked the Governors to join us—Democrats and Republicans alike—so they can update me and the Vice President directly on what they need and what we can possibly do more of. And so we can discuss what's needed today—we have to meet an urgent danger at hand—a plan for what we can do to make sure we're better prepared next time.</p>, <p>One of the important aspects of the bipartisan infrastructure deal that is before the Senate now is it includes billions of dollars—billions of dollars—to strengthen wildfire preparedness, resilience, and response.</p>, <p>It includes funding for prevention efforts, like forest management, and to restore millions of acres of high-risk areas to protect homes and public water sources for drinking. And you know, and overlaying all of this is the necessity to successfully confront climate change.</p>, <p>We may—we have some significant changes we're making in these two pieces of legislation that, God willing, will pass in the next month or so. But we can't ignore how the overlapping and intertwined factors—extreme heat, prolonged drought, and supercharged wildfire conditions are affecting the country.</p>, <p>And so this is a challenge that demands our urgent, urgent action, both today and, as you all know better than anyone else in the country, not just today, but tomorrow, next year, and the year after.</p>, <p>And so I want to thank you, Governors, for your leadership during what is an incredibly challenging period for all of you. God, love you. You're going through—anyway. It's—and I'd like to ask, now, the Vice President to make a few comments. And then, I have some questions for all, and we get in a discussion, with your permission. Thank you.</p>, <p>Vice President.</p>, <p><i>Vice President Kamala D. Harris.</i> Thank you, Mr. President.</p>, <p>We stand with you. We stand with you, and this is a commitment from our administration that we will not only stand with you, but stay in touch with you, mostly to hear from you. We know that the way that we can help you manage and expand your capacity is through the partnership that we have—the Federal and State Government, along with local governments.</p>, <p>This—this issue is ongoing. Each year, as we have discussed, it gets worse. It affects real people—everything from children who are breathing the smoke to parents who are up at night, concerned that they may get an evacuation order at any—at any moment. So, know that we are here to maximize the federal capacity to support the States.</p>, <p>I'm in DC, but, of course, I'm a California girl, and I care deeply about this. We—as I think I've shared with many of you, our family has been under evacuation orders in the last couple of years. And our folks should not have to fear that they are going to lose their home, everything they have, much less risk their lives in these moments.</p>, <p>So thank you all for your courage, for your leadership, and I look forward to staying in touch with you.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p>Folks, I asked the staff—because I think it's—I've had the great honor of being, over the last 15 years, in your States and in the wilderness areas and the national parks. And I asked my staff to put together maps where exactly where the fires are and the areas they're in and what they're affecting.</p>, <p>And so I want to start off with you, Governor Gianforte, up in Montana. You have your hands full, man. And I—looking at—at the map, all away from, you know, Poverty Flats and Crooked Creek, all the way up into Ruby and Hay Creek, and the other end of the State. But the big fires look like they're in Trail Creek and Alder Creek—in those areas that are significant.</p>, <p>And I've got—I have a simple question, and it's a complicated one, but what can we do for you that—that we're just not getting done now? What additional help can we give you now that—that is not there yet?</p>, <p>I mean, cut through all the—all the jargon about, you know, all that—we policy wonks are talking about various programs. Bottom line: What do you need? And can we help—you know, that we haven't?</p>, <p><i>Governor Gregory R. Gianforte of Montana.</i> Good morning, Mr. President, Madam Vice President. I want to thank you for the opportunity to join you, and I want to answer your question because there are some things we can do to collaborate and work closer together.</p>, <p>Just to give a moment of background: As we meet this morning, our heroic firefighters are confronting 19 large-scale fires in Montana alone. And to put that in perspective: Just since January 1, we've had 1,600 fires start in Montana. We've burned about 220,000 acres. These wildfires threaten the safety of our communities.</p>, <p>That Poverty Flats fire that you mentioned, in the last week, burned from initial start to 65,000 acres currently threatening 1,200 households out in the Big Horn County area, our first responders. These devastate our local communities, and the costs keep mounting. We've spent—the State has spent $13 million since July 1 alone.</p>, <p>It could have been much worse. And this gets to your question, Mr. President. Without our State's commitment—and we've shared this with Forest Service and BLM, and they've been very cooperative—to aggressive initial attack, Montana—without that commitment, we would have had many more large-scale fires. And we ask that our Federal partners join us in applying this operating principle. Whether it's a fire that starts on private, State, or Federal land——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Gianforte. </i>——fires are easier to manage when they're smaller.</p>, <p>And when we get after them, we do much better.</p>, <p>As we continue to confront this wildfire season, we're also focused on addressing Montana's forest health crisis. We published, earlier this year, the Montana Forest Action Plan, which identifies 9 million acres of forest land with significant forest health issues and an elevated risk of wildfire. Of those acres at risk, we found about 4 million acres that would benefit most from cross-boundary forest management.</p>, <p>[<i>Gov. Gianforte continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>I agree with you, Mr. President. Now is the time to act. I think it's all about aggressive initial attack and getting more proactive in our forest management.</p>, <p>Again, Mr. President, Vice President Harris, I want to thank you for letting me join you today.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Greg, let me ask you another question, if I may.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Gianforte.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> There's press in the room, and lots of times, I know I do and we all do, use terms which those of us who are in public office—whether it's President, Senator, Governor, et cetera—use, and I don't think—understandably, the American people don't fully understand what they mean. And even I—sometimes the press has so much to cover, I'm not sure they—you talked about the forest health plan. And talk about, as I say to my staff all the time, in plain English, what's that mean. Explain a little bit what that means.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Gianforte.</i> Sure. So we have many forests in Montana that have not had good stewardship. The growth has gotten to the point—I can take you 10 miles west to the State capital in Helena and show you a Federal forest where 90 percent of the trees are standing dead. They've been killed by beetle when——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Right. Right.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Gianforte.</i> And this really creates a tinderbox situation. It reduces habitat. So very, very little wildlife lives there. And when we get a lightning strike or a campfire out of control and a fire starts in a forest like that, we put firefighters at risk. They're very hard to control.</p>, <p>The State has been very proactive. We—the State has about 5 million acres. We've been very active in being stewards of those grounds. And when we thin a forest—this is not clear cuts——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Right.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Gianforte. </i>——but when we thin, when we remove excess fuels, water comes back into surface streams, wildlife comes back into that community. And when wildfire goes through a managed forest, it doesn't then get into the crown. It doesn't burn as hot. We don't have the devastation. And structures aren't threatened. So everybody wins when we have good stewardship of the forest.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That's really important. I—believe it or not, I knew that. But that's really important for people to get it. Because we talk about thinning out the forest. We're talking about a lot of trees, because of climate change as well, where you have bugs, insects, eating up the trees as well, making things that are changing and killing the forest themselves, and they become real tinder. And it's like, you know, dropping a match in a—you know, in—almost like in a pool of fuel.</p>, <p>And so going in and cutting all that out is not the same as going in—I'm glad you made the point of clear cutting—going in and just—so I—look, we do have, and we're—I'm hopeful that we're going to get a lot of the infrastructure plan passed and the recovery act that has a lot of money in here to help you all manage these forests and to have much more money in there for the Bureau of Land Management—anyway—to be able to give you the help you need. Because your State, which I've been through, is a magnificently beautiful State.</p>, <p>It's—and I mean—and the thing—you know, you—I come from the State of Delaware. And you know, you had—we had more acreage burned last year than the State of Delaware and Maryland combined—combined. For you all out in Montana, that ain't much [<i>Laughter</i>] But I want people to get a sense of how massive—how massive—these fires are and how they affect water systems and—anyway, but that's—I'm sorry to take your time, but I wanted you to be able to explain that so people understand that are listening to this.</p>, <p>Let me ask you—let me ask you, Governor Inslee: You know, you've been talking about the impacts of environmental change for a long, long time. And one of the things—and I asked them to show me—to get me a map of where all your fires are in your State. And when you have Delancy and Cub Creek 2 and Cedar Creek, I mean, they're massive fires. Massive.</p>, <p>And what are—you know, as you look at what's transpired over the past month and you look at the road ahead of this wildfire scene, what is your biggest concern, Jay? What is your biggest concern? And again, I ask you the same question: What is the thing we can do most? I mean, you go all the way from Delancy down to ""Lil' Crick,"" as they say, the Creek—[<i>laughter</i>]—you know down in the southwest—southeast part of your State. What are your biggest concerns?</p>, <p><i>Gov. Inslee.</i> Well, first off, thanks for your leadership, Mr. President. It is so refreshing to have a President who really cares about the Western forest.</p>, <p>My biggest concern might surprise you because all of the Governors share these immediate concerns. We have a huge need for additional aerial assets, additional dozer bosses so we can get our dozers into fire lines. We need new training—more trained people. We do have an emerging concern about our fuel supply for our aerial assets. Everything we need to fight forest fires is in dire need across the Western United States, not just in Washington State. We've had a thousand fires. It's burned four times more at this time of year than normal. We've had two and a half times more acreage burn in the last decade than the previous.</p>, <p>[<i>Gov. Inslee continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>Now, there's some other small things that I'm talking to your staff about, about having better independent assistance for towns like Malden that burned down. There's some other coordination.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Inslee.</i> But that's the thing that's going to ultimately decide whether these forests survive in the next century.</p>, <p>Thanks for your leadership, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, thank you for saying that. But you know, one of the things that I say to all your colleagues: When I—when it was proposed to me by some folks that we should have a Civilian Climate Corps of thousands of young people trained to do these things and—at first, it didn't—you know, I said, ""Yes, yes, that sounds good."" And then, I started looking at it.</p>, <p>And the truth of it is, it's not fundamentally different, in terms of the help it can provide across the board training a lot of these—I'm talking about thousands of young people getting paid to be trained and trained well for a very—it's not fundamentally different than the Civilian Corps put together in the Depression that was—had a different purpose. They were building a building. They were doing a whole range of things.</p>, <p>But I just think I'd encourage—and also, we'll send it to all of you. But all you Governors—Democrat, Republican—take a look at it and see if you think I'm—you know, I may have—you know, as my mother would say, my eyes are bigger than my stomach. [<i>Laughter</i>] You know that I may have a bigger appetite.</p>, <p>But I really think it can be helpful. And there—again, I say to your colleagues, there's a lot of money in here to be able to deal with your immediate needs as well.</p>, <p>But anyway, thanks, Jay. And I'll get—I know you have this, but I want to get——</p>, <p><i>Gov. Inslee.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>——more of it to you.</p>, <p>And, Gavin, I—or, Governor, you know, I applaud your your—your establishing the Wildfire Forest Resilience Task Force, which I've learned is cochaired by your secretary of natural resources. I think it's a great example of being able to coordinate Federal, State, local because this is getting real—[<i>laughter</i>]—this is—this is getting—this is—this needs a lot of coordination.</p>, <p>And I understand that PG&amp;E, which provides electric to 17 million of your folks—I understand they recently announced underground 10,000 miles of power lines. Is that true? And what's that going to do to the cost of energy in your State? And—I mean, because that's expensive stuff.</p>, <p><i>Governor Gavin C. Newsom of California.</i> It's a million to three and a half million dollars a mile to go——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Gov. Newsom. </i>——underground in California. Do the math on 10,000 miles.</p>, <p>Of course, do the math on decades of neglect. Ten thousand miles—drop in the bucket. They have 106,000 miles of distribution line. Twenty-five thousand just in high-risk, fire-prone areas which will only grow. That's a 10-year commitment. It's important, but I want to put it in perspective.</p>, <p>I also want to put something else in perspective. Your eyes, Mr. President, are not wider than your stomach. California is proving your theory. Over a year and a half ago, we established the Climate Corps in this State. It's inspiring beyond words. It's also inspired the philanthropic sector——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> It really is, isn't it? I mean, it's not a joke. It is inspiring when you see it. I mean, it's incredible, I think. But——</p>, <p><i>Gov. Newsom.</i> Absolutely. And it's the one thing this country needs more than anything else, and that's common experiences and to focus on the things that bind us together, not just divide us.</p>, <p>[<i>Gov. Newsom continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>]</p>, <p>That fire bled into Nevada and, obviously, impacted not just our two States, but deeply impacted the redundancy of this concern that comes out every year around jurisdictions and incident command and the imperative that we're all on the same page, in terms of those initial attack strategies.</p>, <p>So forgive me for being longwinded, but I wanted to get those clear——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, no that's why we're doing this. I want to find out what's the greatest concerns you have.</p>, <p>And I will—when this meeting is over, I will be on the phone with the Department of Defense and talking about the access to satellite capability.</p>, <p>And—but—I'm looking down the list here. All right, I will follow up with you, Gov—or the Vice President will; she has a mild interest in California—[<i>laughter</i>]—with all the points you just raised, and I do appreciate it.</p>, <p>Now, I want to get to each one of you, but we're going to ask the—I think now is the time the press is going to leave the room, if I am not mistaken. Am I correct?</p>, <p><i>Vice President Harris.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And so we can move on.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the press was ushered out, and the meeting continued.</i>]</p>]"
14,2,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-covid-19-response-and-national-vaccination-efforts-and-exchange-with-9,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good afternoon. Today I want to talk with you about COVID-19.</p>, <p>Maybe the best way to start is: In a significant part of the country, you wouldn't have to take one of these off because you don't have to put one on, like in my home State of Delaware, where I lived in New Castle County, where I was yesterday in Pennsylvania, because people got vaccinated. They got vaccinated. They don't need a mask when you—the majority—the vast majority of people got vaccinated.</p>, <p>Now, look, I want to talk about what's really happening: what it means, what it doesn't mean, and what we need to do this week and the months ahead.</p>, <p>From the moment I was elected, I said I'd always give it to you straight from the shoulder, and we need some straight talk right now. Because there's a lot of fear and misinformation in the country, and we need to cut through it with facts, with science, with the truth.</p>, <p>So what's really happening today? After months and months of cases going down, we're seeing a spike in COVID cases. They're going up. Why? Because of this new form, this new variant called the ""Delta variant."" This is a much different variant than the one we dealt with previously. It's highly transmissible, and it's causing a new wave of cases in those who are not vaccinated.</p>, <p>Our experts tell me that cases will go up further before they start to come back down. But while cases are on the rise, they're not—we're not likely to see, according to experts, a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most areas of the country.</p>, <p>So you have to ask yourself: Why is that? Because 164 million Americans are fully vaccinated, including 80 percent of those most vulnerable: our seniors.</p>, <p>So there's a challenge, as we knew there could be. But there's also good news. We've spent the last 6 months preparing for this possibility. The vaccines are highly effective. We have enough vaccine for everyone to get vaccinated.</p>, <p>And thanks to the American Rescue Plan and the hard work of the American people, we've administered over 325 million vaccinations—doses in the past 6 months. We have the tools to prevent this new wave of COVID from shutting down our businesses, our schools, our society, as we saw happen last year.</p>, <p>I've said from the beginning that we will be guided by the science. So here's what the science tells us. On Tuesday, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, announced its new mask recommendation in parts of the country where COVID cases are substantially high, where people didn't get vaccinated, which they define as 50 new cases for every 100,000 people in a week.</p>, <p>The CDC recommends you wear a mask when you're in public and indoors, like work or in a grocery store. That's true for both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. Why? Because even if you've been fully vaccinated and protected from severe illness from COVID-19, you could have the Delta variant in your system and spread it to someone who isn't vaccinated.</p>, <p>We need to wear masks to protect each other and to stop the rapid spread of this virus as we work to get more people vaccinated. And I hope all Americans who live in areas with substantial or high case rates will follow the mask guidance that's being laid down by the CDC. I certainly will. And I have, because this is one of those areas, in Washington. And, at my decision—at my direction, all Federal personnel and visitors to Federal buildings will have to do the same thing.</p>, <p>As I've said from the beginning, a mask is not a political statement, it's about protecting yourself and protecting others. Masking is one defense against the spread of COVID-19.</p>, <p>But make no mistake: Vaccines are the best defense against you getting severely ill from COVID-19, the very best defense. And you want to know how we put this virus behind us? Well, I'll tell you how: We need to get more people vaccinated.</p>, <p>Look, and it's important to understand what vaccines do and what they don't do. Put simply, the vaccines are designed to save lives and prevent severe illness. They're highly effective at both.</p>, <p>A hundred and ninety million Americans have had at least one shot. Of that group, about 90 percent are done now, and 10 percent are waiting for the second shot. To those folks who have one shot, but not the second: Go get the second shot. Even if you're overdue for the second shot, it is not too late. Go get the second shot now. Now.</p>, <p>The bottom line is: If you're fully vaccinated, you're highly protected from COVID-19. But I also know that many of you who are vaccinated are concerned about what's called ""breakthrough cases."" Yes, some fully vaccinated people will still test positive, and some will show some symptoms of COVID-19. That's expected with almost every vaccine there is for other diseases.</p>, <p>But breakthrough cases remain rare, and almost all are mild cases. In fact, virtually all hospitalizations and deaths are among the unvaccinated.</p>, <p>I also know many of you are wondering if you'll need a booster shot to add another layer of protection. As of now, my medical advisers say the answer is no. No American needs a booster now. But if the science tells us there's a need for boosters, then that's something we'll do. And we have purchased the supply—all the supply—we need to be ready if that was called for.</p>, <p>Folks, the truth is, as more people get vaccinated, we are better protected as a nation to continue reopening safely and responsibly. But we are not fully out of the woods yet, because what is happening in America right now is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Let me say that again: It's a pandemic of the unvaccinated.</p>, <p>There are about 90 million Americans who are eligible to get the shot, but haven't gotten it yet. As I just mentioned, nearly all of the cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19 today are from unvaccinated people.</p>, <p>Last month, a study showed that over 99 percent of COVID-19 deaths had been among the unvaccinated—99 percent. This is an American tragedy. People are dying and will die who don't have to die. If you're out there unvaccinated, you don't have to die.</p>, <p>Read the news, and you'll see stories about unvaccinated patients in hospitals. As they're lying in bed, dying from COVID-19, they're asking, ""Doc, can I get the vaccine?"" And the doctors have to say, ""Sorry, it's too late.""</p>, <p>Right now too many people are dying or watching someone they love dying and saying, ""If I just got vaccinated, if I just""—it's heartbreaking. And it's complicated even more because it's preventable.</p>, <p>America is divided between the majority of eligible people who are vaccinated and those who are not. And I understand that many of you in the majority are frustrated with the consequences of the failure of the minority to get vaccinated.</p>, <p>But I want you to know that I'm going to continue to do everything I can to encourage the unvaccinated to get vaccinated. That includes addressing hesitancy and misinformation head on. For example, I know some of you are—who are unvaccinated think: ""The development of vaccine was rushed, therefore I'm not going to take a chance. As a result, I think it's not safe because it was rushed."" I understand.</p>, <p>But let me explain. Our top scientists at the National Institute of Health, the NIH, and across the country got to work applying decades of research—decades of research—let me repeat that: decades—that have already been done—the research—to develop the COVID-19 vaccine when it hit.</p>, <p>In the last 6 months, more than 325 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in the United States and billions of doses administered around the world. The vaccine was developed and authorized under a Republican administration, and has been distributed and administered under a Democratic administration.</p>, <p>The vaccines are safe, highly effective. And there's nothing political about them. Look at all the people who took a shot at it. They later—we learned a lot of them have already been vaccinated.</p>, <p>From the start, I have to compliment Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. He hasn't made it political. He's encouraged people to get vaccinated and is continuing to do so, and his State is in pretty good shape. Alabama Republican Governor Kay Ivey recently spoke out to encourage vaccination.</p>, <p>And even the commentators on Fox who have been belittling this for a long time—some haven't, but many have—are arguing, ""Get vaccinated."" Look, this is not about red States and blue States, it's literally about life and death. It's about life and death. That's what it's about.</p>, <p>You know—and I know people talk about freedom. But I learned, growing up at school and from my parents, with freedom comes responsibility. Your decision to be unvaccinated impacts someone else.</p>, <p>Unvaccinated people spread the virus. They get sick and fill up our hospitals. And that means if someone else has a heart attack or breaks a hip, there may not be a hospital bed for them.</p>, <p>If you're unvaccinated, you put your doctor and nurses at risk, the same frontline, essential workers who put their lives on the line over the past year and have gone through hell.</p>, <p>Again, with freedom comes responsibility. So, please, exercise responsible judgement. Get vaccinated: for yourself, for the people you love, for your country.</p>, <p>I'm being literal when I say this: As I travel the world, almost every day a foreign leader calls me, asking can I provide his or her country more vaccines? Their people are desperate for vaccines. I'm doing everything to answer those calls. We're sending millions of vaccines to people around the world.</p>, <p>But, folks, it's an American blessing that we have vaccines for each and every American. We've made it our first and top priority to have available vaccines for every eligible American and that's never going to change as long as I'm here.</p>, <p>And it's a shame—it's just such a shame—to squander that blessing. That's why after 6 months of extraordinary work and effort, today I'm laying out additional steps we should be taking to deliver these lifesaving vaccines to more Americans.</p>, <p>First, we're going to provide more incentives to encourage unvaccinated Americans to get vaccinated. That starts with paid leave to get the shot. We're still hearing that people are unable to get time off from their employer to get vaccinated. Well, this is unacceptable.</p>, <p>For some time now, I've said you should be able to get the shot and still get paid. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, the Federal Government is fully reimbursing any small or medium-sized business that provides workers with paid time off to get vaccinated. Employers, this costs you nothing. If you haven't given employees paid time off, do it now, please.</p>, <p>Today I'm announcing that we're taking this a step further. The Federal Government will now reimburse those employers to give their staffs—who give their staffs time off not only to get themselves vaccinated, but also to get their family members vaccinated.</p>, <p>That means employers can get reimbursed if they give parents time off—with paid time, paid leave—to take their kids or their own parents to get vaccinated. So I'm calling on all employees [employers]* across the country to give paid time off to get the shot or to help a family member do so. I promise you: It will cost you, the employer, nothing. You'll be reimbursed.</p>, <p>Secondly, I'm announcing that we'll continue the work—to work with States to encourage unvaccinated people to get vaccinated. In February, the grocery store chain Kroger's offered $100 to their associates if they'd get vaccinated. And it worked. Vaccination rates moved up from 50 percent to 75 percent among their employees.</p>, <p>States like New Mexico, Ohio, and Colorado are offering similar incentive programs that have helped increase vaccination rates. So today I'm calling on all States and local governments to use funding they have received, including from the American Rescue Plan, to give $100 to anyone who gets fully vaccinated.</p>, <p>I know that paying people to get vaccinated might sound unfair to folks who've gotten vaccinated already, but here's the deal: If incentives help us beat this virus, I believe we should use them. We all benefit if we can get more people vaccinated.</p>, <p>But, in addition to providing incentives to encourage vaccination, it's time to impose requirements on key groups to make sure they're vaccinated.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President</i> <i>cleared his throat.</i>]</p>, <p>Excuse me. Just this week, we took an important step to protect our veterans. Like many civilian hospital systems are doing, the Department of Veterans Affairs will now require COVID-19 vaccines for doctors and nurses and other health care workers who provide medical care for our veterans. We must do everything possible to protect our veterans from getting COVID when they come to get medical care they so richly earned serving their country. We owe them.</p>, <p>Next, since many vaccinations are required for Active Duty military today, I'm asking the Defense Department to look into how and when they will add COVID-19 to the list of vaccinations our Armed Forces must get.</p>, <p>Our men and women in uniform who protect this country from grave threats should be protected as much as possible from getting COVID-19. I think this is particularly important because our troops serve in places throughout the world, many where vaccination rates are low and disease is prevalent.</p>, <p>Next, every Federal Government employee will be asked to attest to their vaccination status. Anyone who does not attest or is not vaccinated will be required to mask no matter where they work; test one or two times a week to see if they have acquired COVID; socially distance; and generally will not be allowed to travel for work.</p>, <p>Likewise, today I'm directing my administration to take steps to apply similar standards to all Federal contractors. If you want to do business with the Federal Government, get your workers vaccinated.</p>, <p>Look at the Chamber of Commerce, representing tens of thousands of American businesses, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Business Roundtable, which is comprised of the largest and biggest corporations in America. They're all applauding the actions the Federal Government is taking, and I urge them to follow suit.</p>, <p>I also commend the National Football League that has announced that if there are outbreaks among unvaccinated players and personnel, then the team risks forfeiting games. I urge other sport leagues at every level to take every step they can.</p>, <p>Every day, more businesses are implementing their own vaccine mandates. And the Justice Department has made it clear that it is legal to require COVID-19 vaccines. We all want our lives to get back to normal, and fully vaccinated work places will—will—make that happen more quickly and more successfully. We all know that in our gut. With incentives and mandates, we can make a huge difference and save a lot of lives.</p>, <p>I also want to speak to families with children in school. We can and we must open schools this fall full time. It's better for our children's mental and emotional well-being, and we can't afford another year out of the classroom. Every school should be open, and we're giving them the tools to be able to do so safely, even in those areas where they have a higher vaccination—they have a higher rate of COVID.</p>, <p>Through the American Rescue Plan, we've provided schools billions of dollars to implement safety measures: better ventilation, social distancing, and other measures. In March, when vaccinations were scarce, I prioritized teachers and school workers by utilizing our Federal Pharmacy Program. Almost 90 percent of educators and school staff are now vaccinated.</p>, <p>Additionally, the CDC has provided clear guidance on how all schools can safely protect the kids and bring them back to the classroom: every student wear a mask. It's that simple. So we've funded safety measures at schools, we've vaccinated teachers and staffs, and we can mask up our kids for further protection.</p>, <p>But once again, there's one more thing we need to do: Get more adolescents, ages 12 and up, vaccinated now that they've been cleared. In the past week, the good news is, we're seeing the average number of 12- to 17-year-olds getting vaccinated go—increase 22 percent per day.</p>, <p>Today I'm asking school districts to host one last popup vaccination clinic over the coming weeks for kids ages 12 and up. We're directing the Federal Pharmacy Program to help make that happen. Parents, get your children vaccinated. You do it for so many other things right now.</p>, <p>And for kids under 12, if and when the vaccines are deemed safe for them, we'll be prepared to get the vaccines administered as quickly and as safely as possible.</p>, <p>Look—and as we work to vaccinate more Americans, we're prepared for outbreaks in areas of—where there are unvaccinated people. My administration has made it clear to every Governor that more Federal resources are available to them. This includes the deployment of surge teams composed of experts from the CDC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the FEMA.</p>, <p>We're going to continue to provide States with more testing, treatments, protective equipment, personnel, mobile vaccination clinics to stem the surge of the virus among the unvaccinated.</p>, <p>The pictures of hospitals in several States overloaded with patients is unnecessary, avoidable, and tragic. You know, we'll help any health system overloaded and unable to cope with a spike in cases. We're ready to do that.</p>, <p>Let me close with this: If you're at home and vaccinated, but anxious or even angry, or if you're at home and unvaccinated, unbothered and unconvinced, let's step back and see where we are. Just remember how we've emerged from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer. But really remember just how dark that winter was.</p>, <p>Over 3,600 Americans were dying each and every day. And now, even with the surge among the unvaccinated, we're down to that—300 Americans a day. Significant.</p>, <p>Millions of people were out of work, out of homes, out of hope, and going hungry. Remember those long lines of people in their automobiles waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk?</p>, <p>Experts and pundits said we couldn't get the vaccines. And even if we could get the vaccines, we couldn't get them in people's arms and couldn't get them vaccinated. They predicted our economy would collapse. But remember how we stayed focused and how we went to work?</p>, <p>In 6 months, we got 164 million Americans fully vaccinated. And because we vaccinated so many people, put in place so many safety measures, and got economic help to businesses and people most in need, our economy is recovering.</p>, <p>More than 3 million Americans are back to work since I was sworn in, a faster job growth than any previous administration—any. We're experiencing the fastest economic growth in nearly four decades. The best in the world as of now.</p>, <p>In fact, today's GDP numbers show that in the first half of the year, our economy grew faster than any point in nearly 40 years. Our economy grew more in 6 months than most Wall Street forecasters expected for the entire year before we implemented our plan.</p>, <p>And just yesterday we announced a bipartisan infrastructure deal that's going to continue this momentum over the long term by making the most significant investment to rebuild America in nearly a century.</p>, <p>But we still have to face many challenges. We still have a lot of work to do as we readjust to a postpandemic economy. But we have the right plan. We're coming back. We just have to stay ahead of this virus.</p>, <p>I know this is hard to hear. I know it's frustrating. I know it's exhausting to think we're still in this fight. And I know we hoped this would be a simple, straightforward line, without problems or new challenges. But that isn't real life. We're coming out of the worst public health crisis in 100 years, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.</p>, <p>As I told you before, I carry a card in my pocket—I hope I have it with me—I have—carry a card in my pocket with the number of Americans dead from COVID-19. As of today—this morning—the total deaths in the United States were 609,441. Granted, the death rate per day is way down; it's down to 400, about, dead. But that's more deaths than World War I, World War II, Vietnam, 9/11, Iraq, and Afghanistan wars combined. This is as tough as it gets.</p>, <p>We're Americans. When we get knocked down, we get back up. That's who we are. That's what we do. That's why there's no nation on Earth like us. And we're prepared like never before. We have the tools to save lives, to keep our economy growing and growing and going.</p>, <p>After the past 6 months, following the science, we know we can dramatically lower the cases in this country. We can do this. We brought our economy back to life, and we kept it going. We know we can send our kids back to school. We know we can beat this virus. We can do this. We all just have to do our part.</p>, <p>My fellow Americans, this Nation has never failed when we have come together as the United States of America. So I say to all those who are unvaccinated: Please, please get vaccinated.</p>, <p>And to the rest of America: This is no time to be despondent or let our guard down. We just need to finish the job with science, with facts, with the truth. And together, as Americans, we're going to be able to beat this.</p>, <p>May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, if the vaccines are so effective, why do vaccinated people still need to wear masks?</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Prevention Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, how long do you think it might be necessary to wear masks? And at what point do you think people might have to have a booster shot? Thank you.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I said it in my talk: The booster shot is not needed now. It is possible that it will be needed later. I don't know—they don't—the science hasn't dictated that yet. And the first part of your question?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>How long do you think people might have to wear a mask again?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, if you notice, a lot of places, people don't have to wear masks. Let's get that straight. The places where people have gotten vaccinated, where we have a high vaccination rate, people do not have to wear masks at all.</p>, <p>Like some of you were with me yesterday when I was up in Lehigh Valley. Didn't have to wear a mask there. Don't have to mask if you come home to Delaware with me; I know you love doing that. But you don't have to wear a mask. The places people are probably going to have to wear masks: in those communities where the high rate of unvaccinated stays high and they don't move—they don't move to getting vaccinated.</p>, <p>But I think you're going to find the patience of businesses and the patience of a lot of other people running thin. Because the fact is, if you had high vaccination rates, you—we wouldn't be in the spot right now.</p>, <p>Yes.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Risks Incurred by the Unvaccinated/Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, will this set up an American workplace for Federal workers and private sector that really is the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated? And is that a pressure you're trying to harness now?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, no, I'm not—look, what I'm trying to do is keep people safe. I mean that sincerely.</p>, <p>So if in fact you're unvaccinated, you present a problem to yourself, to your family, and to those with whom you work. Because as was pointed out—I was asked the question about, ""Why would people who have already been vaccinated get it?"" Well, you've got anywhere from 2 to 3 percent, on average—the last study done—that can still get COVID. They don't get very sick. They don't get hospitalized. It's not serious, but they can catch it.</p>, <p>And the concern is, they may be able to pass it on. And so that's all being studied right now. But it's important—thing is, if people are vaccinated, the transmission rate drops through the floor. And that's all we're trying to do.</p>, <p>Yes.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Vaccine Mandates </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, thank you. Why not push for vaccine mandates in States, private companies, schools? Do you want to see those entities pass vaccine mandates?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I'd like to see them continue to move in that direction, and that's why I point it out. I had asked the Justice Department to determine whether that is—they're able to do that legally, and they can. Local communities can do that. Local businesses can do that.</p>, <p>It's still a question whether the Federal Government can mandate the whole country. I don't know that yet.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts/Benefits of Vaccination </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, you said, earlier this week, that we are not headed back towards lockdowns. But if the science is evolving, how can you be so confident in that? You heard—we heard you saying, weeks ago, that ""the virus [was] on the run,"" but Dr. Fauci has also indicated that we are headed in the wrong direction.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, look, you're take—you're literally correct on everything you said, but it doesn't make—come to the conclusion you're implying.</p>, <p>It is clear that if everybody is vaccinated, the existing vaccines work to prevent death, serious illness, hospitalization. Okay? If every—so, if tomorrow I can wave a wand and every American was vaccinated, then in fact we'd be out of the woods.</p>, <p>Now, can something else happen a year from now? Can there be a different virus? Can there be something? It's possible. But I'm talking about COVID and the existing variants that have come forward so far.</p>, <p>So it makes a—it's a simple proposition: If you're vaccinated, you find yourself in a situation where you are—highly unlikely, even if you somehow get the virus; very small percentage do—that you are not going to be hospitalized, you're not going to be on a ventilator, you're not going to be sick, but you could be in a position to possibly spread it to someone who wasn't if you have it in you.</p>, <p>Yes.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts/Proof of Vaccination </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, thank you. I wanted to ask: Why not require that the people show proof that they're vaccinated? And also, if you could just—with the 4 million, how much of an impact do you think this will have? Do you have a projection, sir?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> A projection on what?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>On how many people will get vaccinated by putting in this system?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I can't—I'm not going to get in business of projecting—I—exactly how many people are likely. All I know is that we go through these periods, then we run up against a wall, then something happens where people realize, ""Oh, my lord, this is really a problem,"" and they begin to see things.</p>, <p>Look, the fact that a lot of your friends are now saying, ""Get vaccinated,"" who were—before were saying: ""This is not a problem. This is all a Democratic thing."" With a small ""d"" and a capital ""D."" [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, there's a lot changing. People are becoming aware. The more aware they become, then we have these surges of people going out and getting vaccinated——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>But what about requiring proof——</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>——and it just keeps building.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>I'm sorry, sir.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> What about what?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>What about requiring proof, sir?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, that is—there's two ways to do it, and I think you're going to see some institutions doing that. Like you're going to fly abroad, you've got to—you're going to have to have proof. You're not just going to be able to say, ""Yes, I got tested."" You've got to provide proof.</p>, <p>My guess is: If we don't start to make more progress, a lot of businesses and a lot of enterprises are going to require proof for you to be able to participate.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President—</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>In the back. And then, I'm going to take off, shortly here.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Vaccine Mandates/Proof of Vaccination </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>What further actions are you going to take to encourage private businesses to follow this type of model to either require vaccines or require testing or other preventative procedures?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I just did. I'm going to keep at it. I'm going to be talking about it around the country. I'm——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Are you—but are you going to reach out to private businesses, meet with them, try and actively encourage them to follow this model?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I have. That's why we have folks from the—everyone from the Chamber of Commerce to the manufacturers, et cetera. So, you know, I am—am I going to call a meeting of every, you know, business in the country to come to Washington? And—or go on—I have made the case repeatedly.</p>, <p>I doubt whether there's a single, solitary business that doesn't understand that I think it's smart for them to require testing, require—and if you—if you can't demonstrate, you can't prove you've been vaccinated, you have to be tested.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, on one servicemembers, the military. Servicemembers, sir——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> One on servicemembers, sir——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Potential Coronavirus Vaccine Mandate for U.S. Servicemembers </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Secretary Austin said he was already considering mandating——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Q</i>. ——the vaccine after it was fully approved. Would you like to see the mandate go into effect before full approval? And do you think he's open to that?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I know he's open to it. And the question is: When is the right time to get the most bang for the buck when you do it? A lot of this is timing. And so I think it's going to happen, but I—look, the one thing that you all are politely and appropriately referencing is that it's still a temporary approval. So when does the final approval come? It usually takes a lot of—a lot of work to get there.</p>, <p>I made a commitment I would not tell anyone in the Justice Department who they should prosecute and I would not tell the health industry that they—excuse me, the Government health entities what they should say and do. But my expectation is, they're going to reach that conclusion in the early fall.</p>, <p>Thank you very much.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Prevention Efforts/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Updated Guidance on Face Coverings </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, one more. Mr. President, you said—Mr. President, you said—Mr. President, you said, ""If you are fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask."" And it seems——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I didn't say that.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>You did. I have the quote.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I said if you're fully vaccinated in an area where you do not have—well, let me clarify it.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>In May, you made it sound like a vaccine was——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, in May, that's true.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>——the ticket to losing the mask forever, and it——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That is true at the time, because I thought there were people who were going to understand that getting vaccinated made a gigantic difference. And what happen was: A new variant came along, they didn't get vaccinated, it was spread more rapidly, and people—more people were getting sick. That's the difference.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>How frustrated are you with those people?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Is it possible we'll have another wave, Mr. President?</p>, <p><i>First Lady Jill T. Biden </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>How is the First Lady, sir?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm going to find out in a minute. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's why I'm leaving.</p>]"

14,4,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks at the Mack Lehigh Valley Operations Manufacturing Facility in Lower Macungie Township, Pennsylvania",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-mack-lehigh-valley-operations-manufacturing-facility-lower-macungie-township,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Well, I'm not going to say anything; I just came to drive a truck. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I'm not sure which one I want to drive. That one? There's one back in the corner you can't see. It's the biggest damn pickup truck you ever saw in your life. [<i>Laughter</i>] I tell you what.</p>, <p>Please, everybody, have a seat. Everybody, have a seat.</p>, <p>Carlo, thank you. And, Carlo, I'm sorry about your mom. I really am. So many—so many—people. Well over 630,000 Americans have lost their lives because of COVID. And the only thing I'm going to—and the press keeps wanting me to talk about COVID, but I'm going to mention this one thing.</p>, <p>We still have a lot of people not vaccinated. The pandemic we have now is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. So, please. Please, please, please, if you're not vaccinated, protect yourself and the children out there. It's important.</p>, <p>And, Carlo, having been a significant consumer of health care myself and my family, I've often said this, and I mean it from the bottom of my heart: Thank your daughter for me. If there are any angels in heaven, they're male and female nurses. Not—that's the God's truth. Doctors let you live; they make you want to live. Spent a lot of time in ICU, with my son on a table. Tell her, ""Thank you, thank you, thank you."" I really mean it.</p>, <p>And I want to thank Congresswoman Wild for the passport into her district. Where are you? As they say up in Scranton, she's bragging on y'all. They don't say ""y'all"" up there; they say that in Delaware, but—[<i>laughter</i>]. You do because you've got family from Alabama.</p>, <p>And you've been a tireless champion for the working men and women of the Lehigh Valley, helping us pass a tax cut for families with children that people are seeing now in their bank accounts, showing up in their bank accounts every month, and working with our administration to expand home care for seniors. We've got a generation that's a ""sandwich generation"" between the child and a mom or dad needing help. And they need help. Provide better pay for caregivers. And I want to particularly thank Bobby Casey—he's a great friend of mine—who champions this cause in the Senate for eldercare.</p>, <p>You know, John Mack started this iconic American company in 1890. But things didn't really didn't get off the ground until 4 years later when he brought his William—his brother William down from Scranton. [<i>Laughter</i>] So it goes to show you: If you want to get things moving, bring a guy from Scranton to get it going. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Do you mind if I take my coat off? I'm going to take my coat off.</p>, <p>You know—and, folks, we're getting things moving. We really are. You are.</p>, <p>When I started my campaign for President—and the Gov is still—Gov, I didn't introduce you. I apologize. No, you're the Governor of this State, and you're one of the best Governors in the country. Thank you. And you're a good friend.</p>, <p>When I said I was running when I announced my campaign—and not many people took it seriously—I said I was running for three reasons: one, to restore the soul of this country—a sense of decency and honor; but secondly, to rebuild the backbone of the country: hard-working, middle class folks who built this country. And I want to point out: Unions built the middle class. That's not a joke. Unions built the middle class.</p>, <p>And by the way, in case you regret anything, I just want you guys and women in union know that if it weren't for the UAW in 1972, I never would have won. You think I'm kidding. We had the largest percentage of union workers of any State in the Nation in Delaware back then, including Michigan, because we're a small State and we had big plans. But so—so, before you get upset, remember, you're to blame why I got here. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Look, folks, I think a lot of us come from similar backgrounds: moms, dads, brothers, sisters, family. People who get up every day, work hard, raise their families, pay their taxes, serve their communities, and serve their country. And that's why I moved so quickly to pass the American Rescue Plan shortly after I got in—elected, because we needed to act quickly and boldly to save jobs, save businesses, and save lives. And we did.</p>, <p>We added more than 600,000 jobs per month since I've taken office. That's over 3 million jobs all told. It's the fastest job growth at this point in any administration on record because of you all.</p>, <p>We brought this economy back from the brink: checks in people's pockets, shots in people's arms, tax cuts for working families with children. And we designed our strategy not only to provide a temporary boost, but to lay the foundation for a long-term boom that brings everyone along.</p>, <p>Because when I arrived in office, we had a long time—it's been a long time since the Federal Government had worked hard for working people. Things had been great for big corporations, great for the very wealthy, folks at the top. Those 55 major corporations for the past 3 years paid zero in Federal taxes, making over $40 billion. They had no complaints.</p>, <p>But when I put my hand on that Bible on January 20 and took the oath of office, I made a commitment to the American people: We're going to change the paradigm so working people could have a fighting chance again to get a good education, to get a good job and a raise, to take care of that elderly parent and afford to take care of their children, and stop losing hours of their lives stuck in traffic because the streets are crumbling or waiting for slow, spotty internet to connect them to the world.</p>, <p>That's what the economy we're building is all about. Because given half a chance—and think about this; I mean this from the bottom of—given half a chance, ordinary Americans—the people have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down, just given a half a chance. I mean it.</p>, <p>You may have heard that, in Washington—and I was just on the phone—it looks like we reached a bipartisan agreement on infrastructure, a fancy word for bridges, roads, transit systems, high-speed internet, clean drinking water, cleaning up and capping the orphan wells—over thousands of them abandoned—and abandoned mines, and a modern, resilient electric grid to build.</p>, <p>And guess what? A lot of those abandoned wells are leaking methane. And guess what? The same union guys that dug those wells, they can make the same union wage capping those wells. And I'm working with Democrats and Republicans to get this done, because while there's a lot we don't agree on, I believe that we should be able to work together on the few things we do agree on. I think it's important.</p>, <p>In addition to the physical infrastructure, I also put forward a thing called Build Back Better plan, with investments that are going to really—if I said to you, ""You could have the following: We're going to be—build you a lot of new roads and bridges, or I can make sure we're going to educate your kids so we're the best educated population in the world,"" what do you think would most impact on the growth of America? You'd be the most educated nation in the world. So I'm insisting that we have universal prekindergarten, 2 years of free community college.</p>, <p>All the studies show: No matter what background a kid comes from—whether they're a single mom, a single dad who is on what we used to call ""welfare,"" are in trouble, or come from a middle class household; the kid who comes from the background that's deprived is going to hear, by the time they get to first grade, a million fewer words spoken. A million fewer spoken. What that means is they're behind the eight ball from the start. And a lot more.</p>, <p>But we found out if you put kids in not daycare, but in school at age 3, 4, and 5, it increases by 58 percent the chance, no matter what their background, they'll make it through high school and qualify to go on to community college.</p>, <p>Folks, we need more affordable childcare. There are a lot of women not working today because they can't get—go back to their jobs because they have no one to take care of their children; they can't afford it.</p>, <p>I was a single dad for 5 years when my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, my two little boys were badly banged up. I commuted back and forth to Washington because I couldn't dare leave and move to Washington, because I didn't have my family to help me take care of my kids. I was making a good salary, $42,000 a year then. And guess what? I couldn't afford care—daycare for my children.</p>, <p>Eldercare: How many of you know somebody, has a mom or dad that needs help just because they're getting older and maybe still has their home, but would rather stay in their home, increase their mental state, put them in a position where it's better for their health, but you can't figure out how to keep mom home alone, how to do it—or dad? Well, eldercare is a big piece of this.</p>, <p>Paid leave: We're one of the only industrial countries in the world that you don't get paid leave if you have a sick son, daughter, mother, father, wife, husband, to have some time to take care of that.</p>, <p>Bring more people into the workforce, enhance our productivity, raise wages, and bring down the cost for working families.</p>, <p>You know, I was born up in Scranton, and my dad worked up in Scranton. He was actually from Baltimore, but he worked in Scranton and met my mom—it was his dad moved there. And when coal died, everything died in the Valley, so he had to leave and look for a new job. My dad used to have an expression when we got down to Wilmington. First thing he did, he got a job scrubbing the inside of boilers for a thing called—an outfit called Kyle, the Kyle Corporation.</p>, <p>We finally got to the place where—we get to the place after 5 years we could afford to buy a small house—actually, 6 years. My dad used to say: ""Remember, Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community."" I give my word to what he'd say. And it's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ""Honey, it's going to be okay,"" and mean it.</p>, <p>Because we know that trickle-down economics has never worked. But when working families do well, everybody does well, including the wealthy. Everybody.</p>, <p>Today I'm here to talk about a commitment that's sacred to me and central to our efforts to keep things moving. It's a straightforward solution: support and grow more American-based companies; put more Americans to work in union jobs; strengthen American manufacturing and secure critical supply chains; and confront the climate crisis, which is all about jobs. I can sum it up in two words: Buy American. [<i>Applause</i>] Buy American.</p>, <p>You know, what most people don't know—no matter how informed they are—most people don't know that for literally almost a century, there's been a law on the books in America called the Buy America Act. It's supposed to make sure that when your Government spends your tax dollars in buying goods that they have to be goods that were built, purchased in America.</p>, <p>But the previous administration didn't take it so seriously—in previous ones, not just the last one. They were quick to say: ""You know, we have a lot of money to spend. We've got to buy—the Government is going to buy everything from buildings to aircraft carriers to trucks to whatever it is. But we can't find an American company that can do it all, so we're going to have to issue a waiver. We'll hire the American company, but that American company is going to have a subsidiary overseas where non-American—Americans don't work, where it's much cheaper, they can make more money, and they're going to say, ""We have to have that as part of the chain of building the product.""</p>, <p>The result has been tens of billions of dollars didn't go to jobs and businesses in communities like this one. In recent years, ""Buy American"" has become a hollow promise. But my administration is going to make ""Buy American"" a reality. And I'm putting the weight of the Federal Government behind that commitment with Made in—in the White House itself, we put in a Made in America Office to oversee—not in an agency, in the White House itself—to oversee these efforts.</p>, <p>In my first Cabinet meeting, I told all of the Cabinet members if their agency wants to issue a waiver—they're buying forest—the Forest Department is buying trucks or hoses or whatever they need, okay? They've got to buy something that's—all of it has been made in America.</p>, <p>And you can't give exceptions. Because if you say, ""We can't find one that does—has""—they get their nozzles overseas because they don't have anybody here who can make them, et cetera. I said, ""If you're going to give an exception, you've got to tell the White House specifically why the exception.""</p>, <p>If they still want a waiver, they have to post the request on—publicly so American manufacturers all over the United States and businesses—have a chance to look up now in a new facility and say: ""Hey, they're for companies that make nozzles. They're looking for companies that make the following whatever. We make that. We make that."" And contact us. Then, they can't take the job overseas.</p>, <p>And today we're going to go further: We're going to make the biggest enforcement changes to the Buy American Act in 70 years. Right now, if you manufacture a vehicle—I expect you guys know about that—that gets purchased by the Federal Government, the law says that—and there's about 600,000 vehicles the Federal Government owns, by the way, and replaces and buys—that ""substantially all"" of that vehicle—""substantially all""—should be made in America.</p>, <p>But because of loopholes, over time, you know what ""substantially all"" means today? If 55 percent of it was made in America, you can go ahead and get all of the rest of it purchased other places. To me, 55 percent is not ""substantially all""—it's barely half.</p>, <p>And this is actually a double whammy. First, 55 percent is not high enough. And second, contractors don't have to tell us the total domestic content of their products, they just have to tell us that they hit the threshold. Nobody checking. Well, they've got a new sheriff in town. We're going to be checking. No, I'm serious. I am deadly earnest.</p>, <p>Today I'm directing the Budget Office to issue a rule to raise the amount of domestic content required to be considered made in America from 55 percent to 75 percent. ""Substantially all"" is going to mean substantially all.</p>, <p>And starting with critical products, instead of taking contractors at their word that they hit the threshold, we're going to start making them give us the details so that we can do more to support American manufacturing. We want to be the ones making the innovative parts of every product, the ones that will support more jobs and more small businesses.</p>, <p>For example, I had a tour today. A lovely lady showing me in the parts where—the second stop we made—she said, ""Well, we're having a little problem. We're finding we don't have the computer chips that we need to go into the engines, et cetera."" We basically don't make them anymore in America.</p>, <p>So I got together with a group of 20 Republicans and Democrats. We passed a new piece of legislation providing that South Korea and Taiwan open up plants here in the United States hiring American employees to make those computer chips so we're not held hostage. And, in case you haven't noticed, not only you, but Ford Motor Company said they're going to have to stop producing certain vehicles. They couldn't get the chips. Couldn't get the wafers.</p>, <p>And so I'm also directing my Budget Office to create new rules for critical products where we know we need stronger, more resilient domestic supply chains. We're talking about components like semiconductors, pharmaceutical ingredients, advanced batteries, among other things.</p>, <p>We saw during the early days of the pandemic that the supply chain disruptions can put Americans' lives and livelihoods at risk. When we needed them most, we were short of protective equipment; we were short on ventilators and other essential health equipment. We couldn't get the job done. We couldn't take care of people. We were short on basic equipment. I know a lot of you in this factory stepped up to make PPE at the time. That was a noble service, but it's not a long-term solution.</p>, <p>Yes, we'll keep trading with our allies, but we need to have a resilient supply chain of our own so that we're never again at the mercy of other countries for critical goods ever again. Ever.</p>, <p>You know exactly what I'm talking about. Right here, you've seen production slowdowns. As I've said, you've had your hours cut because of the shortage of computer chips and semiconductors. These chips are in more than just vehicles; they enable so much of our modern lives: our smartphones, our televisions, our medical equipment.</p>, <p>That's why we're investing $50 billion to have the best chip manufacturing in the world come and build factories in the United States of America. And it passed the Senate, and it's called the CHIPS Act, and it's part of my Build Back Better plan. And it is bipartisan, as many Republicans are concerned about it as Democrats.</p>, <p>It's not just semiconductors. With this rule, we'll be able to buy medical products from companies like OraSure that are up—that are down the road in Bethlehem—or up the road in Bethlehem, I should say. I'm used to thinking from Scranton. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Their COVID-19 tests are being made right here, bringing good jobs along with it—meaning that we're developing a homegrown capacity to respond to this pandemic and help prepare for the next one.</p>, <p>And by the way, when I say ""Buy in America,"" I mean from all America. You know, we're going to include communities that have historically been left out of Government procurement, when more contracts are going to go Black and Brown communities, Native Americans, small businesses, every State and Territory, every industry that services and manufactures, and also agriculture.</p>, <p>Part of the problem is that a lot of companies don't even know these opportunities exist to be part of this. And we've got to—and we've got to know—I used to have a great friend—a friend who's a great friend. He used to play for Providence College back in the days when they had great teams. His name was Pete McLaughlin, and he used to have an expression. And he wasn't the—God love him. He passed away, needed a heart transplant.</p>, <p>But anyway, the point is that what Pete used to say—and academics weren't his thing—he used to say something very streetwise. He said, ""Joe, you've got to know how to know."" You've got to know how to know. You can walk into the Library of Congress, one of the greatest libraries in the world, and if you don't know how to use the card catalog, figuratively speaking, it's just all happenstance. You've got to know how to know.</p>, <p>So we started a new manufacturing contracting office in the Small Business Administration to help small and medium-sized businesses bid on these contracts. And my Department of Commerce is working to help Government agencies connect with new domestic suppliers in every State. That's how we're going to build a future that's made in America.</p>, <p>One more reason this is going to make a big difference: Each year, the Federal Government purchases more than $600 billion in goods and services. The Congress passes laws for purchasing things, and as President, I get to decide where we spend them and what we purchase, what—I mean, I have to purchase what was called for, but I get to—and I'm the one who makes the decision—the administration makes a decision on how to spend that $600 billion.</p>, <p>If American companies know that we're going to be buying from them, they're going to be more inclined to hire and make key investments in the future in their companies, like you're doing here.</p>, <p>My Build Back Better plan has incentives for electric vehicle adaptation [adoption],* for increasing the amount of clean energy our Government buys. And these Buy American rules can help guarantee a reliable market.</p>, <p>I just saw the work you're doing on the heavy-duty electric vehicles here, like electric garbage trucks. You know, there are more than 600,000 vehicles in the Federal fleet, including the majority of which—the largest portion of which are at the post office.</p>, <p>As we work to electrify them—as they run out, electrify them—we're going to be making a market for vehicles with electric, supporting both the good jobs being created, as well as innovation we need to electrify our transportation sector and clean up our environment at the same time.</p>, <p>And we'll be expanding my ""Made in America"" initiative to help cities, towns, and Tribes get a better deal when they buy a ""Made in America"" product. It helps the towns, the taxpayers, as well as all of you on the floor of this significant place. It really does.</p>, <p>There are a lot of folks out there who look at how fast and how dramatically the world is changing and world economies are changing. I mean, who would have thought that 20 years ago you'd be making electric garbage trucks here? Seriously, think about it. But they accept it as gospel that working folks aren't going to—aren't—are going to get left behind; they're not going to be able to keep up.</p>, <p>Just the opposite. It's the opposite. Hard-working Americans are the ones who are going to make it happen. We've got to invest in you. We have the most productive workforce in the world here. Given half a chance, there's not a single—single thing you can't do.</p>, <p>So I reject out of hand—I've been criticized for this for some time—but I reject out of hand this defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization mean we can't have good-paying union jobs in America.</p>, <p>And right here, on this factory floor, you're making a product that are fighting climate change. That's why when I hear ""climate change,"" I think jobs. Our manufacturing future, our economic future, our solutions to the climate crisis are all going to be made in America, creating good jobs. This's what it means to build back better.</p>, <p>We came out of this economic crisis—the worst since the Depression—stronger than when we went in. America is one of the few countries of the world—when we get smacked and knocked down, we get up, we come back, and we come back better than we were before we got knocked down. Now, I'm not joking. Think about the—you know, the course of history in America.</p>, <p>And that's why, in the American Rescue Plan we passed shortly after I took office, we're investing considerable sums that will go to cities and towns looking to build back stronger. For example, towns in the southwestern part of this State can now apply for funds to cap those wells that are leaking methane, clean up abandoned coal mines, invest in bringing new employers into abandoned factories, and get help attracting them.</p>, <p>Let me close with this: Back in 2009, during the so-called ""Great Recession,"" the President asked me to be in charge of managing that piece—then-President Trump—excuse me, Freudian slip; that was the last President. He caused—anyway—[<i>laughter</i>]. That was President Obama, when I was Vice President.</p>, <p>And the American auto industry, you remember, was on the rocks. And a lot of people, including a lot of Democrats, thought it wasn't worth investing training—investing in them because the American worker wasn't that good, and they were blah, blah, blah.</p>, <p>I remember the heat that I took—some of you may remember as well—when I stood up and stepped into the rescue of the American automobile industry. My name was often taken in vain on television shows a lot, because ""Why is Biden so committed to the automobile industry?"" Well, because the fundamental mistakes that were made weren't made by the workers; they were made by management.</p>, <p>Today, a lot of the folks who said we shouldn't rescue the American auto industry are the same folks who are saying, ""We don't need to buy American."" What those people never realized is, if you give an American worker just a chance—a fighting chance—there's nothing they won't do. And if you give American companies and communities the chance, there's nothing they can't build. Just look around.</p>, <p>From the steel that raised our cities to these trucks behind me that are going to carry the economy forward, to the workers who are the heart and soul and spine of this Nation—American strength is here. It's in this region. It's you. It's not hyperbole. It's you.</p>, <p>And that's why I've told every foreign leader—and I just got back from Europe meeting with heads of state. One said to me—I said, ""America is back."" And he said, ""For how long?"" A head of state. And I said: ""You know, I want to tell you something. It's never, ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America. We never fail when we decide we're going to do something.""</p>, <p>So, today, I'm placing my bet on America. I know you all are going to make sure it pays off, because it will pay off with good jobs, long-term employment, the ability for America to, once again, reassert its role as the most powerful economy in the world. And that is as important as the size of our military and as anything else we do. And if we think we're not in a race, well, guess what? Take a look at China. Take a look at China.</p>, <p>I've spent an awful lot of time with Xi Jinping, President of China, more than, I'm told, than any other world leader has. And he's made it really clear he doesn't think democracies can compete in the 21st century. And I spent over 25 hours alone with him over the period of the last 5 years—7 years.</p>, <p>And guess what? Just come back from a conference with Putin. He thinks the same thing. Well, I've got news for them: Autocracies will not succeed if we do what we can do as a democracy. Democracies. And if you noticed, not a joke, a lot of the rest of the world is hedging their bets whether to move toward autocracy or stay with democracies.</p>, <p>We have it all, folks. We have everything that we need in this country to—not only today, but for my grandchildren—to be in a situation where we're still the most powerful physically and most powerful economic nation in the world that treats other nations decently and maintains the peace. That's who we are. That's America.</p>, <p>We're the most unique nation in the history of the world. Not a joke. By that I mean: Every other nation was put together based on ethnicity or religion, geography. But not America. America is the most unique nation in the world, and literally, we're based on the idea—an idea. An idea is what formed America. And the idea was—and it sounds corny, but it is absolutely true—no other nation has this as their organizing principle: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights—life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>, <p>We believe it. We've never accomplished it, but every generation that moved us closer and closer and closer to inclusion. And that's why America's real power is not in the exercise of a military power, but people follow us because of our example. That's why the rest of the world follows us.</p>, <p>It was about time we get back up and reassert who we are. This is the United States of America.</p>, <p>Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>]"
14,5,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks at the Liberty Crossing Intelligence Campus and an Exchange With Reporters in McClean, Virginia",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-liberty-crossing-intelligence-campus-and-exchange-with-reporters-mcclean,"[<p><i>The President.</i> It's an honor to be here. I guess you all are the ones that lost the lottery, huh? [<i>Laughter</i>] You had to be here in person.</p>, <p>Well, I'd like to thank Director Haines and Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Christy Abizaid, for showing me around the watch floor.</p>, <p>Folks, the main reason I came—and I mean this sincerely—is to say thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. The American people, almost by definition, are not able to know what you do. And you devote so much of your time, your effort, and many of you are risking your lives in the intelligence community to do things to make sure that your families and people back here are safe—make a difference.</p>, <p>And you'd be amazed—as I traveled the world as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee or member of the Intelligence Committee for all those years, or as Vice President of the United States dealing with national security issues, or as President of the United States—how many of now my foreign counterparts thank you for what you do.</p>, <p>I'd like to introduce you, by the way, to my National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. Jake, would you stand up?</p>, <p>And you know, the leaders of many of our intelligence agencies are here today. And I thank you for your diligence and keeping our country safe and your commitment to supporting your teams. Because, if there's anything, a team sport is what y'all are doing if there's going to be anything that's going to be accomplished.</p>, <p>Because the people I most want to honor and thank today are the intelligence professionals whose names the public is never, ever going to know, never have any notion of what you've done for us: the analysts; the linguists; the collectors and field officers; scientists; support staff; so many others who are real experts, whose careers started much longer before my administration and whose service to our Nation is going to extend well beyond my Presidency.</p>, <p>You know, you're the eyes and ears around the world—in the frontlines of our national defense, and in many cases, for the world, through us. And you serve the American people no matter which political party holds power in Congress or the White House. It's so vital—so vital—that you are and should be totally free of any political pressure or partisan interference. It's basic.</p>, <p>And I want to be absolutely clear that my administration is getting us back to the basics—to the basics. I promise you: You will never see a time, while I'm President of the United States, when my administration in any way tries to affect or alter your judgments about what you think the situation we face is. I'll never politicize the work you do. You have my word on that. It's too important for our country.</p>, <p>Getting back to basics also making—to make sure the IC scrupulously acts within the legal constraints and abides by our strong traditions of internal and congressional oversight, including respect for whistleblower protections. And it also means understanding that much of the work you must do is in secret, but necessary and for the sake of safety. But we should strive to be as open as possible with the American people about the nature of the threats we face and just how serious they are and they aren't.</p>, <p>Every one of you joined up because you believe in being part of something that's bigger than yourself, especially you guys and women in uniform—bigger than yourself. You're patriots. It's a word that we use lightly, but I mean it. It's not—it's not—I don't use it lightly. I really don't.</p>, <p>My son, who spent a year in Iraq and died, was a patriot. He wasn't just somebody else. You all are patriots. You risk your lives and your sacred honor for all that we need to have done for us.</p>, <p>And you believe in the American idea. And living up to that idea is embracing democratic values that are our greatest strength at the end of the day, leading not just by the example of our power, but by the power of your example. The power of your example.</p>, <p>In addition to thanking you for your bravery, integrity, and your sacrifices, I want to make it clear to everyone here today and to the members of the intelligence community working around the globe that you have my full confidence.</p>, <p>That's doesn't mean I don't question what you send me. That meant—doesn't mean—it's not that I—you know, I'm not a new guy on the block in terms of these issues. But one of the reasons I question is to push—push you to the limits—to determine just how certain you are about what you're doing. Lots of times, the only honest answer: ""We're not certain. We're not certain, but this is what our best judgment is.""</p>, <p>I know—I really do—know how hard the work you do is. I've been doing this for a long, long time before I became President. I know there's no such thing as a hundred-percent certainty in the intelligence world. Occasionally, that happens, but rarely, rarely, rarely.</p>, <p>But I also know that your work is invaluable to our ability to make informed, strategic national security decisions. And I just had an interesting meeting, as you all know, with my very close friend, Vladimir Putin. [<i>Laughter</i>] I can tell the—one thing: I've been dealing with world leaders a long, long time. And just like all of you men and women, you can sort of sense somebody else after a while.</p>, <p>He knows that you're better than his team, and it bothers the hell out of him. Not a joke. Not a joke. And he, as a consequence of you, think we have capacities he may even exaggerate. But that's a good thing. That's a good thing.</p>, <p>You know, one of the things I miss most during the 4 years between my time serving as Vice President and being a professor at a college—and I mean this sincerely: From the time I was 31 years old, every morning, I woke up and got in the train to come to—I commuted every day from Delaware after my wife and daughter were killed. And I'd come every day, and one of the things I would get—I'd get a brief in the morning. And I was more informed than 99 percent of the American people. You know what I miss most, for real, from those 4 years of being a professor? The PDB. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, you think I'm joking. I am not. A sense of knowing where all the pieces were. Whether we had it all down, we knew where all the pieces were. Knew where the pieces were.</p>, <p>And so now I have access again—and as to the chagrin of many of you, I read it in detail. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I ask questions of my briefers and follow up with my team. And I ask each of you the same thing I ask Director Haines, ""Just give it to me straight."" I'm not looking for pablum; I'm looking for straight-from-the-shoulder assessments. And when you're not sure, say you're not sure. But give me your best judgment of what you think is—your best judgment is better than almost anybody else's judgment in the whole world—even if the news is hard, even if the news is bad.</p>, <p>I can't make the decisions I need to make if I'm not getting the best unvarnished, unbiased judgments you can give me. I'm not looking to hear nice things. I'm looking to hear what you think to be the truth.</p>, <p>I greatly appreciate just how much work goes into the analysis that the IC produces and the tactical intelligence supporting our warfighters and the superb effort to ensure our IT, our human capital, and the facilities are the best in the world. Because, again, without knowing what—without you telling me, I don't know enough to know what to ask for from the Congress: how much money we need, what we need to focus on.</p>, <p>It's a massive, coordinated, global effort to pull together reliable intelligence in a timely way. And all of you, no matter which agency you work for, are part of one team with one shared mission: keeping America strong and secure in the world or simply making sure your families are safe. It gets down to basic things. Just really basic things.</p>, <p>You know, for most of the last 20 years, much of the work has been focused on counterterrorism, making sure the United States doesn't experience another horror like occurred on September the 11th. And that work has to continue and evolve to address the changing shape of terrorism as we find it today. And it's no great insight on my part, it's going to change significantly more. It's going to change significantly more.</p>, <p>I always get kidded by my colleagues when I served in the Senate for 36 years for quoting Irish poets. They think I quoted Irish poets because I'm Irish. That's not the reason I quote them; they're simply the best poets in the world. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And there's a famous poem written by—that says: ""All has changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born."" The world is changing so rapidly—technologically and in terms of alliances and human intercourse—that more is going to change across the board in the next 10 years than in the last 50 years. That's not hyperbole; that's a fact.</p>, <p>If I talked to you 15 years ago about hypersonic flight, you'd look at me like I was crazy. So much is going to change, and that's going to put an enormous burden on you to stay ahead of the curve. It's really going to get tougher.</p>, <p>But we have the best folks in the world. And one of the things that I think—and I don't want to get off too far afield here, but one of the things that is really important is, our greatest strength, in fact, is our diversity, bringing completely different perspectives to it. And I really mean that. That's not hyperbole. I'm not trying to be ""Kumbaya, everybody get along."" It's just a fact. It's a fact.</p>, <p>And so threats that are more geographically dispersed than they were 20 years ago are going to continue to require our vigilance. We have to continue our efforts to better understand some of the hardest and most important intelligence targets we face as a nation. But you know, we also need to make sure that we're positioning ourselves to stay ahead of security challenges that will stretch the IC in new ways it has never been stretched before.</p>, <p>You know, we've seen how cyber threats, including ransomware attacks, increasingly are able to cause damage and disruption to the real world. I can't guarantee this, and you're as informed as I am, but I think it's more likely we're going to end up—well, if we end up in a war, a real shooting war with a major power, it's going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach of great consequence. And it's increasing exponentially, the capabilities.</p>, <p>When I was with Mr. Putin, who has a real problem—he is—he's sitting on top of an economy that has nuclear weapons and oil wells and nothing else. Nothing else. Their economy is—what?—the eighth smallest in the world now—largest in the world? He knows—he knows—he's in real trouble, which makes him even more dangerous, in my view.</p>, <p>Take a look at China. I've spent more time with Xi Jinping as a world leader than anyone else has. I spent 25 hours alone with him when I was Vice President because it was important that, according to President Obama, that someone knew who the new guy coming on board was, and it couldn't be the President.</p>, <p>I traveled 17,000 miles with him. I've sat with him, with me and just an interpreter—each of us have a simultaneous interpreter. He is deadly earnest about becoming the most powerful military force in the world, as well as the largest—the most prominent economy in the world by the mid-40s—the 2040s. It's real.</p>, <p>I don't know. We probably have some people who aren't totally cleared—I don't know, but you saw just what we found out about hypersonic—we—anyway, as they say in Southern Delaware, ""This boy has got a plan."" And you know, we better figure out how we're going to keep pace without exacerbating and moving us in a position where we increase the hostilities unnecessarily.</p>, <p>I think we also need to take on the rampant disinformation that is making it harder and harder for people to access—assess the facts, be able to make decisions. In today's PDB you all prepared for me, look what Russia is doing already about the 2022 elections and misinformation. It's a pure violation of our sovereignty.</p>, <p>Now you see what's happening. More people get their information from the internet than they do from any other outlet. What's—all the disinformation that's having real consequences in terms of people's access.</p>, <p>And so there's so much that you all—particularly those of you who are new and coming along—are going to have to be—keep up with and ahead of in ways that are not even happening now, as good as everything is.</p>, <p>You know, as we compete for the future of the 21st century with China and other nations, we have to stay on top of the cutting-edge developments of science and technology. If you'd hold for a second here, I want to point out something. You know, we used to—we used to be, when I first got here as a U.S. Senator, actually three and a half decades ago, we invested more money—R&amp;D—money in R&amp;D as a percent of our GDP than any nation in the world. We're now number eight. China was number nine; they're now number two. It matters. It matters.</p>, <p>Look at where we are on things that intelligence communities and others don't even think very often about: about how educated the public is. We're coming around right now. This doesn't relate to the intelligence community per se, but it does.</p>, <p>Think about it. If we were having the debate that was taking place in the United States in the late 1890s and the early 1900s about public education, do you think any of us would say 12 years of free public education was enough to compete in the 21st century? Not a joke. Think about it. What do you think? I don't think there's a shot if we were doing that today.</p>, <p>So the fact we have the best educated public in the world—well, that's our objective—will matter a great deal—matter a great deal. It is as much a part of national defense, in my view, as anything else is.</p>, <p>So I think we have to think differently. I don't expect you to agree with me. I expect you to at least understand where I'm coming from because the world is changing so significantly.</p>, <p>And it's especially important that we work closely with our partners and allies to maintain our technological edge, shore up supply chains, ensure that the rules that govern technologies support democracies, not autocracies.</p>, <p>You know, at the same time, we have to work in cooperation with nations like China and Russia that are our competitors—and possibly mortal competitors down the road—in the context of there's—to meet the existential threats, for example, of climate change. There are certain things that are in our mutual interest. But we can't be lulled into thinking that that's enough and that we don't really have to keep a watchful eye on what the ultimate objective of the other team is. But there are things where we should be cooperating.</p>, <p>This shared danger impacts all nations. Climate challenges are already accelerating instability in our own country and around the world: extreme weather events that are more common and more deadly; food and water insecurity; sea levels rising, resulting in changing climates and driving greater migration and posing fundamental risk to the most vulnerable of communities.</p>, <p>If you could hold for just a second again. We're in a situation where—think about this. Think about this: I'll never forget the first time I went down in the tank as Vice President, after I got elected. The Defense Department said what the greatest threat facing America: climate change.</p>, <p>If in fact the seas' level rises another 2½ feet, you're going to have millions of people migrating, fighting over arable land. You saw what happened in North Africa. What makes us think this doesn't matter? It's not your responsibility, but it's something you're watching, because you know what's going to happen.</p>, <p>People who were Muslim, and the only difference was Black and/or Arab, killing each other by the thousands for arable—a piece of arable land in North Central Africa. But what happens—what happens—in Indonesia if the projections are correct that, in the next 10 years, they may have to move their capital because they're going to be underwater? It matters. It's a strategic question as well as an environmental question.</p>, <p>A dramatically warming Arctic is opening up competition for resources that once were hard to access. I had—as they say in Southern Delaware—they talk at you like this, you know what I mean?—I had a ""come to Jesus"" meeting, an ""altar call"" with Mr. Putin about what he thinks is what Russia's property is in the Arctic. China looking very closely at that as well, where they are. That's what I mean about the world changing. What is that going to do to our strategic doctrine in the next 2, 5, 10, 12 years, when you can circumvent the Arctic without icebreakers?</p>, <p>So look, we need your insight, we need your expertise on all these issues. The one thing you all have in common is, you all have high IQs. You're all smart. You have significant intelligence quotients, and you put it into use to help the elected leaders in this country decide what the best route to go is.</p>, <p>So just as you always have been essential as we've sought to counter traditional threats, the intelligence community is going to be critical to America's strength as we take on these new challenges and hybrid threats.</p>, <p>Finally, I've laid out a broad agenda, and that's just a fraction of it. But we can't do any of this without taking care of our best and most important asset: the American people.</p>, <p>I know the intelligence community is already one of the best places to work in the Federal Government. I asked my staff—when I found out you came in second just after NASA—I said, ""Don't tell me what the White House is ranked."" [<i>Laughter</i>] ""It will hurt my feelings."" And they assured me, no, you didn't rank them. That was a good thing: ""We don't rank the Oval Office."" [<i>Laughter</i>] But all kidding aside, it's about the camaraderie you have, and most of all, it's about being able to trust one another—to trust one another.</p>, <p>My highest priority as President is the safety and security of all Americans, and that includes those who serve in our intelligence community. You take on unique risks in these jobs, and we're taking the cases of anomalous health incidents that are affecting intelligence officers, Government officials, and their families very seriously, for example.</p>, <p>My administration is coordinating a Governmentwide effort to respond to these incidents, because this challenge demands—demands—that departments and agencies, including the entire intelligence community, work together with urgency.</p>, <p>Talked about changes. What's going to happen as we move on and we're able to develop around the world pathogens that can be transmitted to societies and communities? It may not be a nuclear weapon. It may not be a hypersonic missile. It may not be any of the things we think of.</p>, <p>But think about it. Just think about what's happened with one—I'm not suggesting it was intended—a lot more we need to know—but think what's happened: More people have been killed in the United States of America because of COVID than in every single major war we fought combined. Every single one. What's next? What is intended? There's a lot of research going on. You're going to find—you're going to have to increase your ranks with people with significant scientific capacity relative to pathogens.</p>, <p>So my point is: Your value is going to increase and increase and increase and increase in terms of security. You know, from the CIA to all the agencies, there's a lot that's going to happen.</p>, <p>And to all of you who've been affected, we recognize how important it is to make sure that they have the best possible care at a time you're figuring out how to deal with what's happening to, not only to some of those who have been stationed abroad, but their families.</p>, <p>Look, this is a priority for our entire leadership team. So let me just close by saying how much I value the work you do. That's why I wanted to come here today.</p>, <p>So much of the work you do is in secret. It means many, many times you don't get credit—the credit you deserve—and the things you prevented from happening, the catastrophes you've enabled us to avoid, the judgments you've provided us to make our people safer.</p>, <p>And America is probably never going to learn about the lives you've saved or the disasters that never come to pass because of your diligent, professional intelligence work. But I want you to know I know. For the time being, at least, as long as I'm around, I know.</p>, <p>And on behalf of the American people, thank you all for what you do every single day. And we're grateful—we're grateful—that you're there for us. We're safer because of your dedication, your honesty, your integrity, and your significant intellectual capacity to act in our interest.</p>, <p>We're stronger because of your insight, we're a more noble nation because of your insight, and American lives have been saved repeatedly because of your insight. I know it may sound like hyperbole, but from the bottom of my heart, I thank you. I thank you for all you do and continue to do.</p>, <p>And may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops and all those patriots serving in harm's way, because there's a lot still there.

[<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you again.</p>, <p><i>Potential Federal Employee Coronavirus Vaccine Mandate </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>President Biden, will you require Federal employees to get vaccinated?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I beg your pardon?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Will you require all Federal employees to get vaccinated?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That's under consideration right now. But if you're not vaccinated, you're not nearly as smart as I thought you were.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Are you concerned that the CDC's new mask guidance could sow confusion?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> We have a pandemic because of the unvaccinated, and they're sowing enormous confusion. And the more we learn—the more we learn about this virus and the Delta variation, the more we have to be worried and concerned. And the only one thing we know for sure: If those other hundred million people got vaccinated, we'd be in a very different world.</p>, <p>So get vaccinated. If you haven't, you're not nearly as smart as I said you were. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Thanks.</p>]"
14,6,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi of Iraq and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-prime-minister-mustafa-al-kadhimi-iraq-and-exchange-with-0,"[<p><i>President Biden.</i> Well, I'm honored to welcome the Prime Minister. We've known each other for some time. And welcome to the White House, welcome to the Oval, Mr. Prime Minister.</p>, <p>Iraq has been a vital part for the—partner of the United States for some time now in the Middle East. And we've—I've engaged deeply in Iraq for my entire career, back in the Senate, as Vice President, and as President. And I've worked with Iraq to—and matter of fact, my son Beau was in Iraq for a year with the Army National Guard.</p>, <p>And the sacrifices that so many—so many—have made to build the U.S.-Iraq partnership has been real, and it's consequential. And my administration is committed to strengthening that partnership, Mr. Prime Minister.</p>, <p>And the U.S.-Iraqi strategic dialogue is about commitments that expand our cooperation on issues like health care, climate, energy. For, as a matter of fact, I wanted to tell you: I was told you—the half a million—500,000—doses of COVID vaccine we're sending—I was told you were told they wouldn't come for a while. They'll be there in a couple of weeks.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Kadhimi.</i> Thank you.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> They'll be there quickly. And you know, we support strengthening Iraq's democracy, and we're anxious to make sure the election goes forward in October. And we're also committed to our security cooperation. Our shared fight against ISIS is critical for the stability of the region. And our counterterrorism cooperation will continue, even as we shift to this new phase we're going to be talking about.</p>, <p>I'm looking forward to consulting with the Prime Minister today. We have a lot to talk about. He's been a good friend. And I'm anxious to get going.</p>, <p>The floor is yours, sir.</p>, <p><i>Prime Minister Kadhimi.</i> Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor to be here today with our American friends. We have strategic partnership. I'm happy here in Washington to discuss the future of our nation and how to improve this relation between our two countries.</p>, <p>America, they help Iraq. Together, we fight and defeat Daesh—ISIS. And I'd like to thank the American people on behalf of all Iraq's people. Mr. President, I thank you for all the blood and treasure that America has given for a free and democratic Iraq.</p>, <p>Today, our relation is stronger than ever. Our partnership exists for economy, the environment, health, education, culture, and more. I'm looking forward to work with you, Mr. President, to bring our two countries more closer for benefit of Iraq and United States.</p>, <p>God bless our two countries. Thank you, sir, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Thank you. Thank you, folks.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. Prime Minister——</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.</i>]</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]—Veterans Affairs is going to—[<i>inaudible</i>].</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, Veterans Affairs——</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on a second. If you want to talk about Iraq, ask me a question about Iraq.</p>, <p><i>U.S. Military Operations in Iraq </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Yes, sir. I have a question about Iraq. Thank you, Mr. President. How many troops would you like to see in Iraq by the end of this year? And how does the relationship changes, considering this is the last strategic dialogue that you have with Iraq and the Prime Minister?</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> This most recent dialogue you mean.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Correct.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Well, we've been talking a lot. Our Foreign Ministers, our Cabinet members have been talking. We're looking forward to seeing an election in October. We're working very hard with the Iraqi Government to make sure the U.N. and the GCC are—we have oversight; that there's—these are full and fair elections.</p>, <p>I've been in contact with Kadhimi. I have—at any rate, I think things are going well. Our role in Iraq will be as a—dealing with not—it's just to be available, to continue to train, to assist, to help, and to deal with ISIS as it arrives. But we're not going to be, by the end of the year, in a combat mission.</p>, <p><i>Department of Veterans Affairs Coronavirus Vaccine Mandate </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, Veterans Affairs. Mr. President, Veterans Affairs is going to have a mandate for its health care——</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> You are such a pain in the neck, but I'm going to answer your question because we've known each other for so long. It has nothing to do with Iraq.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>I take that as a compliment, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] I'll answer your question. Yes, Veteran Affairs is going to, in fact, require that all docs working in that—in facilities are going to have to be vaccinated.</p>]"
14,7,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the 31st Anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-31st-anniversary-the-americans-with-disabilities-act-and-exchange-with,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Madam Vice President, Tyree—you're an inspiration. Thank you for sharing your story.</p>, <p>Thirty-one years ago today, on the South Lawn of the White House, President George H.W. Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act. He surrounded—he was surrounded by disability advocates and bipartisan Members of the United States Congress, just as we are today.</p>, <p>Speaker Pelosi—welcome, by the way, Madam Speaker—Chairman Leahy, Leader McCarthy, Senator Casey, Congressman Scott, Congressman—[<i>laughter</i>]—where is here? There you are, Paul [Jim].* You understand this better than anybody does. And I want to thank you, Congressman, for all your work. And I want to thank you all for being here.</p>, <p>Second—by the way, where's mom? Mom—is she here?</p>, <p><i>Disability advocate and artist</i> <i>Tyree Brown</i>. She's at home watching.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, she's watching.</p>, <p><i>Ms. Brown.</i> She's watching.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Okay. I thought she looked—I said, ""Mom is out there."" I was going to ask her to stand up. But, Mom, you can't stand up if you're home. But, folks—give you—thank you for what you've done.</p>, <p>The Second Gentleman is here as well. Thank you for being with us as well.</p>, <p>And some of the same folks who fought so hard for this landmark legislation are with us today. I just got off the phone with one of them—a guy named Tom Harkin. And yesterday—or 2 days ago, I was on the phone with one who just had his 98th birthday, Bob Dole. But no one worked harder than Tony Coelho to get this done. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. Others weren't able to join us today but were instrumental in bringing this to life—dear friends, as I said, like Tom Harkin and Bob Dole.</p>, <p>And I also spoke—as I said, Bob is—wanted to pass on his regards, as did Tom. Tom is up in Wisconsin working on—he said on ADA, doing something up there. Now, he didn't explain exactly what.</p>, <p>There are still more with us that are here in spirit, like Ted Kennedy and Major Owens—Congressman Major Owens, and countless other advocates.</p>, <p>I was enormously proud to be a cosponsor to the ADA as Pat Leahy was, as well—if I'm not mistaken—as a Member of the United States Senate. And I'm proud to be here today, as President, alongside so many fearless champions who represent the ongoing legacy of this law, from the foundations to its future.</p>, <p>Thirty-one years ago, after its passage, many Americans have never lived in a world without the ADA. Generations have grown up not knowing a time before it existed. But many of us can still recall an America where a person with a disability was denied service in restaurants and grocery stores, and could be; where a person using a wheelchair couldn't ride on a train or take a bus to work or to school; where an employer could refuse to hire you because of a disability—an America that wasn't built for all Americans.</p>, <p>Then we passed the ADA and made a commitment to build a nation for all of us. All of us. And we moved America closer to fulfilling that promise of liberty and justice and maybe, most importantly, dignity and equality for all.</p>, <p>You know, and perhaps most importantly, we did it together. This was a Democratic bill signed by a Republican President; a product of passion and compassion, not partisanship; progress that wasn't political, but personal to millions of families.</p>, <p>I'll never forget the moment the ADA passed. And you may remember it, Pat. Standing on the floor of the United States Senate, and Tom Harkin sought recognition; he rose. And the first time—first time in the history that I'm aware of in the United States Senate, he stood up, and he signed in a speech to his brother. Tom wasn't just sending a message to millions of deaf and hard-of-hearing folks; he was speaking to his brother Frank. It was personal to him.</p>, <p>It was personal to Bob Dole as well, who lost the use of his right arm in a heroic effort during World War II; who laid out in a hospital for almost 3 years—his injury listed, and they've also lasted an entire lifetime. But like so many Americans, he turned his disability, his apparent limitation, into greater purpose and will. He made the rights of disabled Americans a lifelong cause.</p>, <p>And for more than 60 million Americans living with disabilities, the ADA is so much more than a law. It's a source of opportunity, participation, independent living, and respect and dignity, the bulwark against discrimination, and a path to independence. And for our Nation, the ADA is more than a law as well; it's testament to our character as a people, our character as Americans. It's a triumph of American values.</p>, <p>But of course, this law didn't bring an end to the work we need to do. Today, too many Americans still face barriers to freedom and equality. But thanks to this movement that spans all races, beliefs, backgrounds, and generations, we're once again making progress together.</p>, <p>In my first day in office, I was proud to sign an Executive order establishing a Governmentwide commitment to advancing equity, including people with disabilities. And I was proud to appoint the first-ever White House Disability Policy Director, Kim Knackstedt. Where are you, Kim? Where is Kim? Thank you, Kim.</p>, <p>And I'm ensuring that dignity and rights of disabled Americans are lifted up in every policy we pursue, from continuing to make sure that this administration looks like America, appointing people with disabilities to positions across the Government.</p>, <p>In the American Rescue Plan, we were able to include substantial support for schools that better serve students with disabilities, that—expanding access to vaccines for disabled Americans. As part of my Build Back Better plan—it was already mentioned—we propose $400 billion to expand access to home- and community-based care, helping people with disabilities and older adults live more independently. And I'm glad that Congress is beginning to move on the Better Care Better Jobs Act, championed by my buddy, Bobby Casey—Bobby, thank you—which builds on that effort.</p>, <p>This past year, the entire Nation saw just how vital our caregivers are and how critical home-based care truly is for so many Americans. This legislation will help ensure that caregivers are fairly compensated for their work. In addition, I've also called on Congress to eliminate the discriminatory sub-minimum wage provisions that too often keep people with disabilities from getting good jobs with fair wages.</p>, <p>And because of additional Executive orders I've signed, we're working to remove barriers that hold back disabled Americans from exercising their sacred right to vote. And we're ensuring that the Federal Government is a model employer when it comes to wages, accommodations, and opportunities to advance people with disabilities. That's a firm commitment.</p>, <p>And today, finally, I'm proud to announce a new effort, the first of its kind, to help Americans grappling with long-term effects of COVID-19 that doctors call ""long COVID."" Many Americans who seemingly recover from the virus still face lingering challenges like breathing problems, brain fog, chronic pain, and fatigue. These conditions can sometimes—can sometimes—rise to the level of a disability.</p>, <p>So we're bringing agencies together to make sure Americans with long COVID, who have a disability, have access to the rights and resources that are due under the disability law, which includes accommodations and services in the workplace, in school, and our health care system, so they can live their lives in dignity and get the support they need as they continue to navigate these challenges.</p>, <p>We made important progress, but we still have work to do. We have to keep going to ensure that every single American has a chance to contribute their talents and thrive and succeed.</p>, <p>And I know that today's fearless advocates, some of whom are with us today, are going to accomplish incredible things.</p>, <p>People like Mr.—excuse me, people like Mr. Tootle. Where are you?</p>, <p><i>Disability advocate Gaylon Tootle</i>. Here.</p>, <p><i>The President</i>. Stand up, man. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>, <p>You know, I want to thank you for your continued efforts to build an America for everyone, and as I said, you courageous advocates who led the way 31 years ago—a long time before the foundation for progress is strong, though. It's part of the more—moral bedrock of our Nation and something every American should be proud of.</p>, <p>Now it's my honor to sign the proclamation on the 31st anniversary of the ADA.</p>, <p>I want to thank you all. May God bless you and all of you dealing with disabilities. You are an inspiration to all of us. I really mean it. You're an absolute inspiration.</p>, <p>May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Now I'm going to walk over and sign this. And I'm going to invite up, though—Nancy, come on up. Steny. I think we ought to get you up here. You were—you're a big part of it—Tony Coelho. Am I leaving anybody out?</p>, <p><i>Vice President Kamala D. Harris</i>. Pat.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Pat, you were there at the time. Why don't you get your rear end up here and put your—[<i>laughter</i>]. The leader is taking his camera, because Pat would rather use his camera than, I think, anything else.</p>, <p><i>Vice President Harris</i>. Come on.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, come on.</p>, <p><i>Vice President Harris</i>. Come on up.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Tony, you get right in the back here.

14,8,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks at a Campaign Rally for Virginia Democratic Gubernatorial Candidate Terence R. McAuliffe in Arlington, Virginia",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-campaign-rally-for-virginia-democratic-gubernatorial-candidate-terence-r-mcauliffe,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Hello, Virginia! It's so great to be back. First off, it goes without saying how much I appreciate your current Governor, Ralph Northam, by the way. Because of the hard work of the American people, we've put ourselves in a position for us to control the virus instead of it controlling us.</p>, <p>Here in Virginia, COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations are down 90 percent since January; 54 percent of your population has been fully vaccinated, 82 percent of your seniors, both of which are above the national average.</p>, <p>But this didn't happen by itself. It's due to the heroic vaccination program, one of the greatest and most complex operational challenges in American history. It happens when we all work together: the Federal Government, States, cities, the private sector, and all of Americans.</p>, <p>Look, it happens when you have Governors like Ralph who've been a key partner, coordinating FEMA and the National Guard to move personnel and resources around the State to get shots in arms. It happens when you're honest with people.</p>, <p>You know, I know folks are watching the number of cases rising again and are wondering what it means for them. Well, here's the truth: If you're fully vaccinated, you're safer with a higher degree of protection. But if you're not vaccinated, you are not protected.</p>, <p>And now—what we have now is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. And by the way—you know the old expression—you notice a lot of our very conservative friends have finally had an ""altar call."" [<i>Laughter</i>] They've seen the Lord—[<i>laughter</i>]—whether it's on Fox News or whether it's the most conservative commentators or Governors.</p>, <p>Thank God the Governor of Arkansas—excuse me, of Alabama—had one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country—is now—and I give—I'm genuinely complimenting her——</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Stop Line 3! Stop Line 3! Stop Line 3!</p>, <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you, Joe!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That's okay. That's all right. That's all right. No, no, no. Let them talk. No, let——</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe!</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That's okay. Look, look, this is not a Trump rally. Let them holler. No one is paying attention to them.</p>, <p><i>Audience members. </i>Stop Line 3! Stop Line 3! Stop Line 3!<i> </i></p>, <p><i>The President. </i>Look, here's the point: Virtually all the COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations are today among the unvaccinated people. And I know this has gotten a bit politicized, but I hope it's starting to change. It's not about red States or blue States or guys like that hollering; it's about life, and it's about death. And I know Governor Northam is going to work like the devil to finish the job. Thank you, Gov.</p>, <p>Look—and, of course, it's great to be with another great friend that's been around—I've been around a long time, and I've—seldom do I get to campaign for someone who I've agreed with more on basically everything. We go back all the way to roots in Syracuse, New York.</p>, <p>I'm talking about—and before that, I'm actually talking about Dorothy. [<i>Laughter</i>] Her roots don't go there, but it—look, she's always been there for me and Jill when we've needed her most. She was an incredible First Lady of Virginia, and she will be again. She is the very best.</p>, <p>And, Dorothy, speaking of First Ladies, I'm Jill's husband. Jill wanted to be here tonight. But if you turn on your—turn on the Olympics and watch Team U.S.A., you'll see Jill Biden standing there, cheering with them.</p>, <p>The Japanese Prime Minister, who was—I invited him to be the first person to come to the White House—head of state—he made it real clear: He didn't want me, he wanted her to go. [<i>Laughter</i>] He is a man of incredible judgment. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Look, folks, now, of course, it's great to be with my friend and your once and future Governor, Terry McAuliffe.</p>, <p>I mean this—think about this——</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Terry! Terry! Terry!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> You've got it. You're not going to find anyone—I mean anyone—who knows how to get more done for Virginia than Terry. That's a fact. You don't have to wonder what kind of Governor Terry will be; you know what kind of Governor he was and what kind of Governor he'll be again.</p>, <p>He was a great Governor of Virginia, and he'll be even greater this time because he even has more going for him. And, Virginia, you've got to elect him again. You've got to elect him again. And I mean this: not just for Virginia, but for the country. The country is looking. These off-year elections, the country is looking. This is a big deal.</p>, <p>Terry and I share a lot in common. I ran against Donald Trump, and so is Terry. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I whipped Donald Trump in Virginia, and so will Terry. I tell you what, the guy Terry is running against is an acolyte of Donald Trump, for real. I mean, it's just like—I don't know where these guys come from. [<i>Laughter</i>] I really mean it.</p>, <p>But above all, Terry and I—Terry, we share the same vision about delivering results and, maybe most importantly, why we got involved in politics in the first place. The very wealthy—and I respect anybody who makes a lot of money; you should be able to be a millionaire or billionaire, whatever you want, as long as you pay your fair share. But here's the deal: They don't need me to protect them.</p>, <p>I got involved in politics because the neighborhood I came from, the towns I came from—Scranton and Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town—delivering results for hard-working people, who, if you just give them a chance—just a chance, they never, never let the country down.</p>, <p>You know—I really mean that. That's not hyperbole. I really mean it. Just, look—I've been in office now for 6 months, as of a couple days ago.</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yeah!</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>And I think the administration has a lot to be proud of. We've vaccinated over 160 million Americans. We've created over 3 million new jobs, more than any administration has in the first 6 months in entire Presidential history. Never has it happened before.</p>, <p>We eliminated—what we're on—we're now estimated to be on track—the economy, not growing before the recession, before COVID, said the economy would grow—it would be 3 and 3½ percent. Now everything from the OECD to all Wall Street suggests that we're going to grow this economy 7 percent just this year. That is the highest growth in more than four decades in America. In fact, it's the best job growth in the world right now.</p>, <p>And in just the past few weeks, one of the biggest tax cuts in the history for families in American with kids went into effect this last week.</p>, <p>I've been saying—I really mean this—it's about time ordinary, hard-working people get a tax break. Because that's what it is. Parents should see that money going into their bank accounts right now. And let me tell you what it's going to mean for Americans: We're going to cut child poverty in half this year because of that.</p>, <p>Look, Terry and I share the same basic truth: Trickle-down economies never work. It's time to build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. That's where we are. And by the way, the wealthy have never done poorly when the middle class and the working class people do well—they do well.</p>, <p>Look, Terry understands that it started with the American Rescue Plan that's delivering immediate relief to the folks who needed it most, folks who were on the back of their—on heels, a lot of them knocked down. Those rescue checks that went out to more than 80 percent of the adults and children in Virginia that provide a little extra breathing room for people.</p>, <p>My dad used to say—I really mean this—my dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck; it's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community. It's about just having, Joey""—and I mean this sincerely. When he left—lost everything in Scranton, and we moved to Delaware, he said: ""Joey, it's about a little breathing room. That's all people are asking for, is just a little bit of breathing room, a little extra room.""</p>, <p>Look, aid for small businesses, that helps them hire, reopen their doors. I'm looking—here it is. Excuse me.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President paused to take a drink of water.</i>]</p>, <p>Aid to cities and counties to keep their police officers and firefighters and first responders on the job, educators on the job. The American Rescue Plan lowered health insurance premiums for those buying into the Affordable Care Act by 40 percent on average, saving people $600 a year. And Terry knows the work continues: that health care should be right, just not a privilege, folks.</p>, <p>And as I said when I was running, with Terry and Dorothy's help, it's not enough to build back. I mean this sincerely. America is the only nation in the world, when it's faced a crisis, has come back stronger than before the crisis—the only one. I'm not joking. We have to build back and build back better. It's amazing how that phrase has caught on around the world, isn't it?</p>, <p>But Terry and I know, along with Mark Warner and Tim Kaine and Don Beyer and Abby Spanberger, who are working on this in Congress. It means modernizing our physical infrastructure. Folks, we used to invest more than any country in the world in research and development. And we had the number-one infrastructure in the world: the best roads, highways, airports, ports.</p>, <p>Infrastructure is about rebuilding roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes that are poisoning our kids and the water system; delivering high-speed internet to every single Virginian, rural and urban; making sure ""Buy American""—so when we invest in the jobs, when we purchase all this, that American workers are doing the work.</p>, <p>It's not that complicated. It really isn't if you fight for it.</p>, <p>Terry and I share the belief that building back better means investing also in our human infrastructure. You know, that's my plan. It includes all the things Terry is fighting for. Terry and I believe that when we educate our children earlier, they do better. They do better. No, by the way—no matter what background they come from, all the studies at the great universities in this State and others have—in the last 8 years—have pointed out that if a kid goes to—not daycare, but preschool, beginning at age 3, they increase, by 58 percent, the possibility of going all the way through school and on to community college.</p>, <p>That's why we support universal pre-K for 3- and 4-years-old. And, Terry, if I get it done, you all aren't going to have to pay for it here in Virginia.</p>, <p>And look, we believe 12 years of education is not enough to compete in the 21st-century economy. That's why I want to make 2-year community college available to every single American. We can afford to do this.</p>, <p>I do have one concern. My wife Jill is teaching full time still as a community college professor and First Lady. But Terry is going to be her boss again. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because she teaches at—anyway—Northern Virginia Community College. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And by the way, Terry, since the time she started working there, she's never stopped teaching. When we got elected, she thought that she was going to continue to teach. She thought I might object. I strongly supported it. Teaching is not what my wife does, it's who she is.</p>, <p>And, folks, look—look—the fact is that the idea that we are able to bring together people to give them great opportunities is totally within—you know, look—and we can afford to do this. We can afford to do this. If the very wealthy just start paying their fair share just a little bit.</p>, <p>Terry and I know how hard the pandemic has been on working families, especially women. About 2 million women are still unable to go back into the workforce during this pandemic due to things like not being able to afford childcare.</p>, <p>Look, when I got elected to the United States Senate, I was 29 years old. Between the time I got elected and before I was sworn in, there was an automobile accident. My wife and daughter were killed, and my two boys almost died. And by the way, I thank all firefighters. It took the ""Jaws of Life"" 3 hours to get them out on top of their dead mom and dead sister. You saved their lives.</p>, <p>And I needed help. I was a Senator making $42,000 a year. I could no longer afford daycare and someone to take care of my kids, then fly. And thank God I had a sister who is my friend, who—she and her husband, without my asking, moved in and helped me raise my kids. My mom and my brother as well. I got lucky.</p>, <p>But look, the idea, as a single mom or a single dad, working and having young children, it's awful hard. That's why Terry and I want to expand paid leave and childcare in this country.</p>, <p>And by the way, Terry, you and I have been talking about this for a long time. We've been talking about high drug prices, how incredibly high they are and how they—we keep getting ripped off. You know, we pay more for our drugs than any major country in the world.</p>, <p>But here's the deal. There's a way to do it: Let Medicare negotiate drug prices. And guess what? All of the prices are going to come down. And it will pay for itself. I promise you, I'm going to get that done.</p>, <p>Look—and here's the deal, Terry and I know this can be paid for. Look, we support asking the wealthiest 1 percent who got that $2 trillion tax cut that, in fact, not a single penny was paid for, the so-called ""Trump tax cut.""</p>, <p>And guess what? Just pay. Begin to pay their fair share. Corporate America—I come from the corporate capital of the world. More corporations are, in fact, registered in Delaware than every other State in the Union combined. I got elected 36 years there, because I was honest with them.</p>, <p>Look, right today, 50 of the biggest corporations in America of the Fortune 500—50 of them don't pay—and this is not an exaggeration; check it out—not a single solitary penny in Federal taxes. Not one. And they made over 40——</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, but—no, but I'm not doing this to get—I just want to make it clear to you. [<i>Laughter</i>] Here's the deal: They made over $40 billion. If they just paid a minimum tax of 15 percent, they'd raise the dollars—all we need to do all this education we're talking about here.</p>, <p>Look, you know—when I was Vice President, the President asked me to check out what the major corporations needed the most. Along with the Secretary of Commerce, we interviewed three hundred and, I think it was, fifty-six—it could have been forty-six—but over three hundred and fifty CEOs and major corporations.</p>, <p>You know what they all said? ""I need a better educated workforce."" Well, guess what? They're not spending any money to educate the workforce.</p>, <p>But if we want to make sure America succeeds and runs the world again—economically runs and—be the most powerful economy in the world, we should make sure that they have a chance.</p>, <p>These millionaires and billionaires—I'm not one of these guys that say you shouldn't be able to be a millionaire or billionaire. But just pay your fair share.</p>, <p>Look, all told, experts in the World Bank and outfits like Wall Street—on Wall Street, like Moody's, estimate that my plan will grow the economy and create $2 million more jobs over the $16 million they said in 10 years we'd create—good-paying jobs. Good-paying jobs.</p>, <p>A significant amount of these jobs will pay the prevailing wage of 30, 40, 50 bucks an hour. Ninety percent of the jobs in our infrastructure plan go to people without a college degree. Folks, we're proposing a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America, a once-in-a-generation investment in American jobs and families that's going to position us to win the competition for the 21st century.</p>, <p>But we've got to get it done. And I need a partner like Terry who not only is respected in this State, but is respected by Governors all across America, who knows how to get it done in the States. Folks, on his watch as Governor the last time, the Virginia economy boomed. Two hundred million—200,000 jobs created. Unemployment went down in every single county, including rural Virginia, by nearly 50 percent.</p>, <p>He attracted major companies to this State. Look how your State grew. And by the way, any of you who are in the business know the first thing you try to attract a company to come to your city, your State, your town—the first thing they ask is: ""What's the highway system? Will I have access to interstate? Is the port available? Tell me whether or not I have broadband. Tell me whether or not""—all the things. All the things we're going to build.</p>, <p>You know, look, Terry worked with Republicans to invest in education, transportation, and workforce development. And by the way, Virginia has a whole bunch of veterans and Active Duty military members, more than almost any State. And guess what? The American Rescue Plan marked one of the biggest investments in veterans' health in a long, long time. It will upgrade VA hospitals that are 50 years old, reduce the shortages of doctors and nurses.</p>, <p>No veteran—from my son who passed away on—should pick up a phone and say, or have a wife or husband call and say, ""I need help,"" and say, ""We can't see you for a while."" We owe them immediate action. Immediate. It's a sacred obligation.</p>, <p>And I know no Governor who stood up for our veterans and military families more than this guy, helping them apply their skills to good-paying civilian jobs, fields like cybersecurity and health care. He also worked with the General Assembly to fund two new veteran care centers, including the first one in Hampton Roads region, which is hard to believe.</p>, <p>Terry understands. He knows—he knows—also about crime prevention as a top priority. He understands how important it is to have funding—to find funding—from the American Rescue Plan to provide law enforcement personnel with more resources, not fewer resources.</p>, <p>Look, we need to help them in a lot of ways. We need to do away with chokeholds and all those things. I agree, but the other side of this is we need them to have more social workers, more veterans, more psychological help, more psychologists. And where it happens, it works. Personnel and resources, they keep communities safe.</p>, <p>And he has taken on the gun lobby to enact sensible gun safety measures without infringing on anybody's Second Amendment right, including keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.</p>, <p>Here's what else: Terry is going to guarantee he's going to move to get a $15 minimum wage. Think about it, folks. Just think about it. And you—maybe some of you, maybe you know people.</p>, <p>Anybody working 40 hours a week making less than $15 an hour is, in fact, living in poverty as defined by poverty in America. It should not happen, period. Period.</p>, <p>An amazing number of American people who are struggling have rental costs and housing costs that are at least 30 to 35 percent of their total income. How do you do that? How do you make it, especially if you have a child? Look, folks, housing that's affordable—everybody is going to be in the plan.</p>, <p>And, like me, when Terry thinks about the climate crisis, he thinks three things: jobs, jobs, jobs. It is the reason why we're going to lead the world.</p>, <p>Let me close with this—and I'm sorry, I'm getting kind of wrapped up in this. [<i>Laughter</i>] I need him. I need him. Look, in this election and in 2022, the question the American people are going to be asking is whether or not we're helping them and their families. Not giving them anything—are we giving them a shot, just giving them an even shot? Do we understand what they're going through? Can we deliver for them?</p>, <p>As Democrats, we have to show we do understand, and we're delivering for them, and we're keeping our promises. We just have to keep making the case, just as the Republican Party today offers nothing but fear, lies, and broken promises.</p>, <p>No, listen—I mean, think about it—turning on the television every day and seeing a replay of what happened on January 6 and saying, ""I was told there were a lot of peaceful, wonderful people.""</p>, <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> God—no, I really mean it. Think about it. It is bizarre.</p>, <p>We have to keep cutting through the Republican fog that government is the problem and show that ""We the People"" are the solution. We're the most unique country—think about this—we're the most unique country in the history of the world. Not a joke. Every other country is put together based on race, religion, ethnicity, background, except the United States.</p>, <p>The United States is based on—the only country in the world based on the proposition that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all women and men are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. We've never met the test, but we've never walked away from it like the Republicans have.</p>, <p>We have never walked away. And we keep—every administration, we keep moving that needle further and further. Look, folks, we're going to have to go out and win: win this thing, win races up and down the ticket. We've got to protect your majority in the House of Delegates. We've got to reelect—we've got to reelect Mark as attorney general. We've got to reelect Hala as your Lieutenant Governor.</p>, <p>We've got to elect Terry back as Governor. He's been here before. He knows what to do to. He knows how to get things done.</p>, <p>Virginia, we did it in 2020. In the battle for the soul of America, the people voted. Democracy prevailed. The Constitution held. We have to do this again. I've said, time and again, no matter what, you can never stop the American people from voting. And they're trying like hell. We have to decide. The power must always be with the people.</p>, <p>Fifty—I promise you this—fifty years from now—fifty years from now, our children, our grandchildren will look back and know that it was at this moment America won the 21st century again. And it starts now. Virginia, it starts with Terry. It starts with you.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you.</p>]"
14,9,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Labor and Business Leaders and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-labor-and-business-leaders-and-exchange-with-reporters,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Well, I'm delighted you're all here. I'm meeting with a group of labor and business leaders who—and this is one of those meetings I've been looking forward to.</p>, <p>They're not here to negotiate with one another. The good news is that they've been here negotiating—not negotiating—supporting what we're trying to get done on the infrastructure bill.</p>, <p>And I know that we've been looking for this bipartisan effort to get this infrastructure bill passed, as you all know, and they share my belief that it's both in the interest of business and labor to get this done. And it's about—it's not about energy versus environment, it's not about business versus labor; it's all about, basically, a race to the future.</p>, <p>I've been traveling the world lately and back out where I used to spend a lot of time, in the G-7 and meeting with—the summits with the Russians, as well as NATO. And I tell you, the rest of the world is looking to see whether we can get something done. I'm not joking about that.</p>, <p>The single biggest issue—I know you've traveled the world, all of you—and the fact is that they're trying to figure out whether we're so divided that we can't get something done. And—but I am convinced that they're convinced now that we have an opportunity to make some real fundamental changes that generate growth in the future.</p>, <p>You know, the days used to be that we were in a position where the United States invested more money in research and development three, four decades ago than any nation in the world. Now we're number eight. And it used to be that China was number nine, and now they're number two.</p>, <p>This is about a race for the 21st century. And you know—and what we're doing here is, in this race for the future, it's about connecting Americans—all Americans, rural and urban—to high-speed internet, repairing our roads and our bridges so that we can, in fact, no longer be ranked number 9 or 10 in terms of infrastructure in America. Back to what we used to be—we used to lead the world.</p>, <p>You know, electrify our school buses and our transit systems. And we're going to build national charging networks for electric vehicles, eliminate the Nation's lead service pipes. We got 400,000 homes—I mean, there's just a whole lot we can do that's going to put a lot of people to work. And it's going to improve the life of a lot of people.</p>, <p>We're going to update our power grid, which, as you saw what happened to Texas last year, there's a lot we can do. It's going to generate—and, Lonnie, your outfit is going be awful busy, and——</p>, <p><i>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers International President Lonnie R. Stephenson.</i> We're ready.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And we're going—we have to win the—we really do. This is not hyperbole. We have to win the competition for the 21st century. That's really what's at stake, and I think you all know that. And that's what the bipartisan infrastructure does, in my view.</p>, <p>I want to thank everyone here for supporting it. We're going to get into the details, among all of us, about what we think about what needs to be improved, what can be made better or worse. You know, so we want everybody to be engaged.</p>, <p>So thank you all, folks, for being here. We're going to now get down to business.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts/Coronavirus Delta Variant </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, what conversations have you had with public health officials about possibly changing the mask mandate for vaccinated Americans?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I'll respond to the COVID question quickly.</p>, <p>We follow the science. What's happening now is, all the major scientific operations in this country and the 25-person group we put together are looking at all the possibilities of what's happening now.</p>, <p>We have a pandemic among the nonvaccinated, those who are not vaccinated.</p>, <p>If you are vaccinated, you are safe. If you are vaccinated, you have over a 98-percent chance of never catching the virus at all. And if you catch it, you're likely to—overwhelming proof, so far, is you're not going to be hospitalized, you're not going to be sick, you're going to probably have no signs that you had it, and you are not going to die. It's a simple proposition.</p>, <p>And what they're doing is, they're going into—investigating every aspect of any change that could or might take place.</p>, <p>But the vaccines are good against all of the variants that are out there, including the Delta variant.</p>, <p>Thank you so much for being here.</p>]"
15,0,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on Signing the VOCA Fix To Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act of 2021,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-the-voca-fix-sustain-the-crime-victims-fund-act-2021,"[<p>[<i>As the President approached the podium,</i> <i>""Hail to the Chief"" could be heard.</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Every time I hear that, I wonder when he's coming. [<i>Laughter</i>] Please, everybody sit down. Thank you.</p>, <p>Let me begin by doing something no speaker should ever do, by apologizing. I got a little tied up in that other office I work in, Pat, and I apologize for keeping you waiting because I know you're all as equally busy as I am. And I want to thank you.</p>, <p>Today, I think, is a day of hope. And I mean that. A day of hope and healing for victims of crime and organizations that support those victims of crime.</p>, <p>And I want to thank the Vice President and the Second Gentleman, Senators Durbin—I think he's here; I thought I saw him. Senator Durbin and Baldwin and Grassley and Graham and Murkowski. Representatives Nadler and Fitzpatrick and Jackson Lee and Wagner and Scanlon. And everyone who has helped make possible this moment, including so many of you who are here today that I haven't mentioned.</p>, <p>When someone commits a crime, it's not enough to bring the predator to justice; we also need to support the victims. And it's something that, way back—150 years ago, when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we spent a lot of time working on and setting up victims' funds. What—that's what this Crime Victims Fund does.</p>, <p>In many years of working on the issue, I've visited an awful lot of domestic violence shelters. Every time I'd go into a city, I would quietly—before I went to where I was supposed to be—quietly slip in and spend time in the domestic violence shelter to speak to the people giving the services and people getting the services.</p>, <p>And you know, many times, the body language that you'd see when you walked in was one of the victims of crime finding themselves almost curled up, Dianne, in a ball. They were still suffering from a serious, serious, not only physical abuse they received, but quite frankly, the emotional abuse. And you can see the pain. You can see the pain was still with them, and you wondered when was this going to abate, no matter what we did.</p>, <p>According to the CDC—and I'm—I think Senator Feinstein remembers—I got in trouble because when I was pushing the legislation, way back in those days, I said, ""I'm convinced that women who are victims of domestic violence suffer from posttraumatic stress no different than a solider being shot at regularly."" You come home and every time your significant other would come home, if dinner wasn't ready, they smashed your head against the wall. There's no difference than being shot at.</p>, <p>And the CDC, 2 years later, came out and said, ""Survivors can experience mental health problems and such depression and the symptoms of posttraumatic stress syndrome."" Even before research confirmed it, you could see it.</p>, <p>And there are economic costs for survivors as well: medical costs, lost productivity from work, and navigating the court system. That's why victims compensation programs helps victims and their families cover the costs they'd suffered from the crime. They can—there can be counseling and medical bills, lost wages because you couldn't work, paying for temporary housing for a family fleeing abuse, even fixing a broken door kicked down by an abuser. And you know, the vast majority of children out in the street are the children who are, in fact, the children of abused women. It can also be a long-term support survivors need to heal, every time, in every single sense of the word.</p>, <p>In 2019, these victims' compensation funds went directly to 230,000 victims—230,000. These funds also got to States, Territories, and Tribes to support thousands of victim service organizations. These organizations have provided services and support to over 13 million survivors.</p>, <p>And by the way, last night some of you heard me talk about the need for more policing that understands the need for communities and citizens. These funds will also go to law enforcement agencies to support training on how to respond to victims who have experienced trauma.</p>, <p>In 1984, I was proud to support the passage of the Victims of Crime Act and created—that created this fund. I'm also proud to sign the law that significantly strengthened it today. This fund doesn't take a dime of taxpayers' money; it uses fines and penalties paid by convicted Federal criminals. However, fines from what are called ""nonprosecutorial agreements"" or defendant—or ""deferred prosecution agreements"" did not go into this Victims Crimes Fund in the past.</p>, <p>Since there's been more and more of these agreements in recent years, the fund is being depleted. That meant dramatic cuts in the funding it could provide for victims and for organizations to support these victims.</p>, <p>Between 2017 and today, the amount of money in these funds has gone down 92 percent, which has resulted in a 70-percent reduction in victims assistance programs and grants. This means that, for a lot of victims, the help they need isn't there any longer.</p>, <p>When my son Beau was the attorney general of the State of Delaware, he took pride in getting more support more quickly to victims, especially to protect and care for child victims. And I know that, as the San Francisco DA and the California attorney general, Vice President Harris expanded support for victims of crime and launched one of the Nation's first medical centers focused on treating childhood trauma caused by violence in a home or in a community.</p>, <p>This bill is going to allow us to make sure that all the fines and penalties that are from Federal cases go into the victims—the Crime Victims Fund to rebuild this fund, because it's badly needed. This is going to enable us to provide more help and support to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse, trafficking, and other crimes all across America.</p>, <p>In order to provide more access and safety and services for victims of gender-based violence, it's long past time to reauthorize and strengthen the protections through the Violence Against Women Act. Please. Please. You know, you can—[<i>applause</i>]—you know from experience you all can come together in a bipartisan, bicameral way and to pass this bill. We need to do the same thing to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act without further delay.</p>, <p>You know, after these changes in the Victims Crime Act passed this week, a leader from one of the States' Coalition Against Domestic Violence sent a letter to her national organization. And she wrote about working in the shelter where their ability to serve people rose and fell based on the fundings of victim services. She told the story of a client she lost to domestic violence homicide because the budget cuts left them without space at the shelter or staff needed to help this particular woman.</p>, <p>Upon learning about the law I'm about to sign today, she wrote, and I quote—I quote, ""I think about her every day. This is going to be truly lifesaving,"" end of quote. This is what you've done, truly lifesaving.</p>, <p>In closing, I want to thank those angels working on the frontlines to help these victims, especially during this pandemic that's made the work both more difficult, more in demand, and more dangerous. And I want to thank the advocates who mobilized and bring together these important changes in the law.</p>, <p>There are thousands of people out there who may not know about the work you did to get this bill passed, but they'll know that they're getting the help they need to put their lives back together and move toward healing and toward justice. I will now have the great honor of signing the bill. And I'd invite the sponsors to come on up and stand with me if you're willing.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the bill, distributed pens, and posed for a photograph.</i>]</p>, <p>This is one of those deals where what they did is literally, not figuratively, going to change the lives of women and children and some men out there. So thank you.</p>]"
15,1,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks and an Exchange With Reporters in Cincinnati, Ohio",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-and-exchange-with-reporters-cincinnati-ohio,"[<p><i>The President.</i> I can't see you, but I know you're there. I—thank you for your patience today. I know it's a long day for you. I really mean it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>, <p>I was just talking to one of the people who asked the question who had lost a son. I was—anyway——</p>, <p><i>Public Debt Limit </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, the debt limit: Mitch McConnell said today that Republicans won't vote to raise the debt limit, and Democrats will have to include it in reconciliation. What's your response?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I was hoping that wouldn't be the case. You know, for the last 4 years, they've just extended the debt limit. The reason for the significant debt is because of their—their debt, their tax limit—their, excuse me, their tax cut.</p>, <p>And there are going to be a couple of very difficult decisions that are going to have to be made to get through the end of the year. And one of them is the debt limit and extending the debt.</p>, <p>So I don't have an answer for you, but it's—I hope we can get by it.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, what do you think of the Republicans and Fox News changing their tune on the vaccine?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, rather than be critical of it, I thank them for it. I think it's a matter of—first of all, in truth, I don't know how many of them believed what they were saying. They may have really believed it, but—the things that they've been saying.</p>, <p>And—but I think once the realization occurred that this virus was only killing primarily those people who had not been vaccinated, I think it was sort of, as we Catholics say, a bit of an epiphany for them. You know, it was a—like a—you know, conversion on the way to Damascus or something.</p>, <p>But I think it became real, and I'm glad they had the courage to say what they said. And hopefully, it will have some impact.</p>, <p><i>Russia-Germany Nord Stream II Natural Gas Pipeline </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Any comment on the Nord Stream deal, sir? The fact that there's a deal that Nord Stream II is going to move forward.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, I can. Nord Stream is 99-percent finished. The idea that anything that was going to be said or done was going to stop it was not possible.</p>, <p>But I had, as you know, very, very fruitful discussions with Angela Merkel, and her—she is working and—with the German Government on a commitment that suggests that if, in fact, Russia takes pains to deliberately inflict pain on Ukraine or other countries, they will respond.</p>, <p><i>""Breakthrough"" Coronavirus Cases </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, do you have—what do you say to Americans who have done everything right? They've gotten fully vaccinated, and they still contract COVID, a ""breakthrough case,"" as it's called. What do say to them?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, they're very—I say to them: They're very, very, very, very, very, very few people—number one. Those that it happened to, I don't—it may be possible—I know of none where they're hospitalized, in ICU, and/or have passed away.</p>, <p>So, at a minimum, I can say that even if they did contract it—which I'm sorry they did—it's such a tiny percentage, and it is not life-threatening.</p>, <p>Guys, we've got to get on the plane, or they're going to leave us all. Thank you. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Congressional Commission on the January 6 Civil Unrest and Violence at the U.S. Capitol </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, one more question, on January 6.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> January 6 is—look, guys.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Are you concerned that no matter what happens now, the result is going to be perceived as partisan?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, because I think the American public, as I said tonight—you can't not understand what happened and still be partisan and try to cover it up. But nobody really believes it wasn't an insurrection. I mean, you know it. You can see by the looks on their faces. They know it.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>]"

And I know you don't want to sit down, right?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> You'd rather stand here and talk to these guys.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm going to go out in the audience. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> We're going to get to the audience questions in just a moment. But I have a couple questions I want to ask you.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Sure.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Because you know the pandemic is a big concern for everyone, really, around the world——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Sure is.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon. </i>——especially around America. New cases are up three—you know, three times since last month. Right? The pandemic is a big concern. Hospitalizations, death rising.</p>, <p><i>Rise in Coronavirus Cases/Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts </i></p>, <p>So you said last month that this—that the virus is in retreat. Do you still feel that way? Is that still the case?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, the virus—look, here's the—it's real simple: We have a pandemic for those who haven't gotten a vaccination. It's that basic, that simple. Ten thousand people have recently died; 9,950 of them, thereabouts, are people who hadn't been vaccinated.</p>, <p>There's a simple, basic proposition: If you're vaccinated, you're not going to be hospitalized, you're not going to be in an ICU unit, and you're not going to die.</p>, <p>So it's gigantically important that you act like—we all act like Americans that care about our fellow Americans. To get—there's legitimate questions people can ask—that they worry about getting vaccinated—but the questions should be asked, answered, and people should get vaccinated.</p>, <p>But this is not a pandemic. We've made sure that since I got in office, we've inoculated over 160 million people; 85 percent of people over the age of 50. Anyway.</p>, <p>It's frustrating.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Containment Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Yes. But what do you say to people who are worried about a new round of restrictions and mask mandates and so forth?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I'm saying—look—[<i>laughter</i>]—it's a little bit like when I got elected. You know, the—this pandemic was out of control. You know, we've lost more people in the United States—over 630-some-thousand people than in every major war we've ever fought, in the United States of America. And that's come to a screeching halt for those who've been vaccinated. It really has. Not a joke. This is overwhelming evidence to sustain that.</p>, <p>And so what I say to people who are worried about a new pandemic is: Get vaccinated. If you're vaccinated, even if you do catch the ""virus,"" quote, unquote—like people talk about it in normal terms—you're in overwhelming—not many people do. If you do, you're not likely to get sick. You're probably going to be symptomless. You're not going to be in a position where you—where your life is in danger.</p>, <p>So it's really, kind of, basic.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Well, let's get to the questions, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Okay.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Okay. I want to introduce you to Andrea Granieri. She's a community resource director for a charter school. She's a Democrat currently running for her local school board.</p>, <p>Andrea, welcome.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> God love you. [<i>Laughter</i>] The most important, thankless job in the world: being on a school board.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Containment Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you. So, here in Hamilton County, the vaccination rate remains at about 50 percent—and you talked about the virus that's spreading. Masks are seen less and less. And, as you know, children under age 12 still are not eligible to be vaccinated. Schools are working with all of this information as they think about reopening next month. As a school employee and as a parent to children under age 12, what—I'm really concerned. What is your message to those parents, educators, and school districts?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I understand your concern. I really do. My children are grown now, but my grandchildren—and I have one who's only 1½ years old. So, you know, I understand—number one.</p>, <p>My message is that one of the reasons why—you remember the criticism I got initially, saying, ""Teachers should get vaccination, get in line first."" The vast majority of teachers are vaccinated, number one.</p>, <p>Number two, the CDC is going to say that what we should do is, everyone over the age of—under the age of 12 should probably be wearing a mask in school. That's probably what's going to happen.</p>, <p>Secondly, those over the age of 12 who are able to get vaccinated—if you're vaccinated, you shouldn't wear a mask. If you aren't vaccinated, you should be wearing a mask.</p>, <p>So it's going to get a little bit tight in terms of, ""Well, are mom or dad being honest that, you know, Johnny did or did not get vaccinated?"" That's going to raise questions. But I think what's going to happen is, you're going to see this work out in ways that people are going to know in the community. Everybody knows in the community whether or not Johnny really did get the vaccination when he's 15 or 17 years old.</p>, <p>And so it's going to—I think it's a matter of community responsibility, and I think you're going to see it work through.</p>, <p><i>Expansion of Coronavirus Vaccine Eligibility </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Well, let me ask—let me follow up on her question, asking: When will children under 12 be able to get vaccinated?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Soon, I believe. Now, look, one of the things that I committed to do when I got elected—I said——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> How soon is ""soon,"" Mr. President? Not to——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I—and let me hear—let me finish the question—the answer. ""Soon"" in the sense that I do not tell any scientists what they should do. I do not interfere.</p>, <p>And so they are doing—they are doing the examinations now—the testing now, and making the decision now. When they are ready, when they've done all the scientific need to be done to determine children at ages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, they, in fact, are—all have different makeups. They're developing. They're trying to figure out whether or not there's a vaccination that would affect one child that's at such and such an age and not another child. That's underway.</p>, <p>Just like the other question, there's a logical—and I've heard you speak about it, because you always—I'm not being solicitous, but you—you're always straight up about what you're doing.</p>, <p>And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you are—why can't the experts say, ""We know that this virus is, in fact—it's going to be""—or, excuse me—""We know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved.""</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>That's underway too. I expect that to occur quickly.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Well, that means—you mean for the FDA?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> For the FDA.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Yes. So what do you——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> The Federal Drug Administration.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Vaccination Development/Food and Drug Administration Approval/Coronavirus Delta Variant </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> You said that you're talking to scientists, though, but what are they telling you, Mr. President?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> What they're telling me is, ""Let us decide, based on scientific data, in how we proceed. Do it the way we would ordinarily do it.""</p>, <p>Look, for example, everybody talks about how, you know, this virus came—this—the drugs that are designed to kill the virus came along so quickly. They've been working on it for two decades. There's nothing quick about this. It's been over two decades.</p>, <p>So people said, ""I'm not taking a drug that was approved so quickly."" It's been two decades. The truth is we haven't said it enough to people to allay their feels—there's nothing—their fears. This is nothing that just happened yesterday, and they said, ""Well, let's take a shot on this."" And there's a process. Usually the process takes the better part of a year or more to get some of these things decided.</p>, <p>But the expectation—they're not promising me any specific date—but my expectation, talking to the group of scientists we put together—over 20 of them, plus others in the field—is that sometime maybe in the beginning of the school year—at the end of August, beginning of September, October—they'll get a final approval saying the FDA said: ""No, this is it. It's good.""</p>, <p>But again, one last thing. I—we don't talk enough to you about this, I don't think. One last thing that's really important is: We're not in a position where we think that any virus—including the Delta virus, which is much more transmissible and more deadly in terms of unvaccinated people—the various shots that people are getting now cover that. They're—you're okay. You're not going to—you're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Yes. I want to stay on the subject. I want to get to Dr. Nicole Baldwin. She's a pediatrician and a Republican.</p>, <p>Dr. Baldwin, go ahead.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Doc, how are you?</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Containment Efforts/Spread of Disinformation on Social Media/Public Education Efforts/Rise in Coronavirus Cases </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Hi. Thank you for taking my question, Mr. President. I am a pediatrician who utilizes social media to educate about health. And I'm very concerned about the rise in misinformation from the anti-vaccine community that is eroding trust in lifesaving vaccines. Spread of this misinformation and declining vaccination rates could leave Americans vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases in the future.</p>, <p>So what I want to know is: What is the White House doing to combat medical misinformation and to restore America's faith in science?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> What we're doing is, number one, to restore America's faith in science is listen to the scientists. [<i>Applause</i>] No, I'm not joking. I mean, literally listen to the scientists, and not interfere, not rush anything. Just make—let the scientists proceed, because they desperately want to get this right—number one.</p>, <p>Number two, you may have heard—I never get myself in trouble, as you know, politically—[<i>laughter</i>]—but you may have heard that I was critical of some of the things that are on Facebook, and it was that I was attacking Facebook. I wasn't attacking Facebook. There was a report out saying that for that—something like 45 percent of the overwhelming disinformation on Facebook comes from 12 individuals. I said: They're killing people—those 12 individuals; that misinformation is going to kill people. Not a joke. Not a joke.</p>, <p>It's like telling your kid, ""I tell you what""—4 years old—""when you see a red light, cross the street."" I mean, come on.</p>, <p>And so what we're trying to do is use every avenue we can—public, private, Government, nongovernment—to try to get the facts out, what they really are. And one of the things, Doc, that's happening, that I'm feeling better about—I'm not being a wise guy now. You know, you—one of those other networks is not a big fan of mine. [<i>Laughter</i>] One you talk about a lot.</p>, <p>But if you noticed, as they say in that southern part of my State, ""They've had an altar call,"" some of those guys. [<i>Laughter</i>] All of a sudden, they're out there saying, ""Let's get vaccinated. Let's get vaccinated."" The very people who before this were saying—so that—but that—I shouldn't make fun. That's good. It's good. It's good. We just have to keep telling the truth. That's why—for example, my wife just flew to Alaska today to do an event in Alaska about making sure people understand and get vaccinated, talking about COVID, et cetera.</p>, <p>So it's—you know. And by the way, there's pockets. If you notice, there's about—what?—four or five States that have close to 45 percent or whatever. Don't hold me to the exact number.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Lower than that, even. In my home State of Louisiana, it's 36 percent, and I think there are other southern States.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, but I mean, out of all the cases——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>——all the cases, a very overwhelming majority of those cases are in four or five States. And it's just not—there's nothing political about this. There's no blue or red.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Well, let's bring in Christian Oliver. He's a Democrat. He works for the insurance industry.</p>, <p>Christian, what's your question?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Well, so, my wife Stephanie and I are newlyweds, as of this past Saturday.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'd brag if I were you too.</p>, <p>As they say when they look at me and my wife: ""You married up, kid."" [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Vaccination Rates Among African Americans/Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>[<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you.</p>, <p>We require all of our guests and vendors to be vaccinated to ensure safety. We are African American, and in many of our communities, people are against the vaccine. A reason that stood out the most in regards to our guests is that they don't see the vaccine as being as safe as the CDC put it—puts it out to be. How are you working toward convincing those in these communities that the vaccine is safe?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> It's really an important question because, in the African American community, there is less of an uptake of the vaccination. Number one, there's a reason for that: You know, you go back just to even World War II. African Americans were used as experimental; they were almost like guinea pigs in terms of—they were—anyway.</p>, <p>And your mom and dad remember that, or your grandparents remember that. And so there's a reason for people to think that: ""I don't know, I'm not sure I trust. I'm not sure I trust this."" Plus, a lot of disinformation on top of it.</p>, <p>One of the things that we're doing is what I've done—""we've"" done, excuse me—my team has done—is, we've provided the ability to put in African American communities the vaccine and those who are, in fact, able to administer the vaccine, and people who are respected in the community, in the vaccine—in those areas, particularly in areas where you have public health community—public health centers, where you, in fact, have people who are the folks who are really at the low end of the economic scale, don't have much access to anything.</p>, <p>So we've taken literally mobile vans and people to the communities, to the hardest hit communities, and it's beginning to have some impact. But we have to talk about it more.</p>, <p>For example, I was just with—I get in trouble because my wife is a Philly girl and a Philly fan, an Eagles fan. I just hosted the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. And there's a guy—there's a quarterback there. What's his name, man? [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Anyway, all kidding aside, you know, what we're doing is getting people of consequence, who are respected in the community—whether they're athletes, whether or not they are entertainers, whether they're just well respected. And by the way, one of the things I've gotten able to get done: I've get all—I have overwhelming support from the African American clergy that I sort of come from, and my support. They are opening up their churches for—as vaccination centers.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Can I ask you something, Mr. President? Because, you know—and by the way, you got—I don't know if you heard that you got applause when you corrected the ""I"" for ""we."" And we're talking about ""we,"" and I think that's——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, it is ""we.""</p>, <p><i>Restoring Trust in Government/Efforts To Counter Coronavirus Disinformation/Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon. </i>——a commendable attribute to have.</p>, <p>But even with my own family—I was just able to get with them. I haven't seen my mom in a year and a half, except for 2 weeks ago. I hadn't seen my family for 2 years since the last time they visited me two summers ago. But even within my own family—here I am on television every night—there is ambivalence, there's misinformation, and there's also mistrust in the system. How do you fix that?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I think—you're going to—this is going to seem like a nonanswer to start with. One of the things I said when I ran for office—it's not Democrat or Republican again—is we've got to restore faith in Government. You've got to get people to a point where they trust Government. And I made a commitment that when I made a mistake, I'd tell you I've made mistakes. And when I think I got it right, I'll say it. But I'll take responsibility for what I do and say.</p>, <p>Part of it is just generally—[<i>applause</i>]—no, I don't mean that—part of it is, generally, raising confidence in elected officials. Raising confidence. And I know this is going to sound like a non-answer to you, but part of this is that, you know—you know because you're one of the most informed journalists in the country. You know the criticism I got when I said I'm going to unite the country. They said, ""You can't unite the country."" Well, if we can't unite the country, we can never get some of these problems solved.</p>, <p>And that goes to trust. Why can't you unite the country? Why isn't there a willingness to trust? Government trust is really at a—was at an incredibly low ebb. It's coming up some.</p>, <p>So, with regard to your family in particular, part of it is not just that they see you on television and trust you; the people who seem to have the most impact are the—are, you know, that—for that 17-year-old kid, the kid that he or she plays ball with. ""You got the vaccination?</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon</i>. Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Are you okay? I mean, you seem""—""No, it works."" Or you, you know—or the mom and dad, or the neighbor, or when you go to church, or when you're—no, I really mean it.</p>, <p>There are trusted interlocutors. Think of the people—if your kid wanted to find out whether or not there were—there's a man on the Moon, or whatever—you know, something, or you know, whether those aliens are here or not—you know, who are the people they talk to beyond the kids who love talking about it? They go to people they respect, and they say, ""What do you think?""</p>, <p>And so they should be asking other people—the people they're—everything from their teachers to their ministers to the priest, to people that they trust.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts/Vaccine Hesitancy </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Well, part of it is that—don't you think part of it is that young people, especially those who are 30—maybe 30, 40 and under, they feel like they're invincible; they haven't faced mortality yet.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Isn't it amazing we're saying ""40 or younger""? [<i>Laughter</i>] It's hard to say, isn't it?</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> It is. But for them, you know, at first, the virus wasn't affecting them as much.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> And so they may feel that they're invincible. And now that this Delta variant is affecting them, maybe they'll have a ""come to Jesus"" of some sort. I'm——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, by the way, I think that is—that's happening. And look, think about this: This is the worst health crisis in a hundred years. As I said, more people have died than all our major wars combined. Think about that.</p>, <p>If I told you that or you had told me that 2 years ago, I'd say: ""Come on. That's not going to happen in America."" But it happened. It happened. And people are unfortunately—some more slowly than others—now, by the way, remember when I first got elected, the issue was, well, I said I was going to do a million shots a week, and people said, ""Biden can't do that"" or ""Biden team can't do that."" And then, it was 2 million. We had trouble getting enough people—and people who wanted to get vaccinated. We're opening up stadiums. We're getting 100,000 people coming through.</p>, <p>So the vast majority of the American people said: ""I understand. I want to get this vaccination."" But now, when the—when it's phased off, either: ""I'm invincible, I'm young, I'm not going to get sick, it won't happen to me""—or whatever the reason—now they're looking around and they're saying: ""Whoa, boy. In the community I live in, there's very few people who have gotten the vaccination. This COVID is much more transmissible; it's really rising. I better get some""—so I think it's gradually changing. And you've got a great dog there, kid. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>[<i>Inaudible</i>]</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> By the way, that is Danielle Lippi. She's a student here at the university, and she's a Republican. She's got a question for you. Go ahead, Danielle.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Yes. Okay.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> But your dog is a Democrat—I can tell. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm teasing. I'm teasing. I'm a big dog person. I'm sorry.</p>, <p><i>National Economy/Inflation Risk/Wages/Changes in the Labor Market </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Her name is Wonder. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>So my question is: The economy is picking up significantly as it reopens from the pandemic. Are you concerned about the higher inflation prices, especially as we see gasoline, automotive, and food prices increase rapidly? What is your administration doing to help prevent the economy from overheating, such as the poor and middle class are not hurt by the higher prices of goods in the long run?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> First of all, the good news is, the economy is picking up significantly. It's rational, when you think about it. The cost of an automobile bill, it's kind of back to what it was before the pandemic. We compare what the prices were for the last year in the pandemic, and they are up. They're up because, in fact, there was not much to call for.</p>, <p>For example, automobiles: You know, you had the rental car companies selling off their entire stock. You found yourself in the same way with automobile dealers. And all of a sudden, now it's coming back, and we're going to grow at 7 percent, as is expected. We created more jobs in the first 6 months of my—our administration than any time in American history. No President has ever—no administration has ever created as many jobs. And all of a sudden, people are saying—[<i>applause</i>]—no, I don't say it—but it goes to the legitimate question being asked about the concern about inflation.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>The vast majority of the experts, including Wall Street, are suggesting that it's highly unlikely that it's going to be long-term inflation that's going to get out of hand. There will be near-term inflation because everything is now trying to be picked back up.</p>, <p>And by the way, that's one of the reasons why I also signed an Executive order dealing with the whole idea of competition, you know, the idea that we're in a situation where there are so many companies who are keeping people out of the competition. For example, you have over 600,000 people out there signing—6 million people signing a—I'd better check the number—[<i>laughter</i>]—of signing noncompete agreements. Not because they have any secret, but because they were working for one fast food restaurant, and they're told they can't get 10 cents more going across town going to the other fast food restaurant. Why? To keep wages down.</p>, <p>And so what's happening now is, all of a sudden, people are having choices. You know, I always thought the free market system was not only that there's competition among companies, but, guess what? Companies should have to compete for workers. Guess what? Maybe even pay more money.</p>, <p><i>Rising Prices/Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> So you seem pretty confident that inflation is temporary. But if you're pumping all of this money into the economy, couldn't that add to——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, look, here's the deal: Moody's, today, went out—a Wall Street firm, not some liberal think tank—said if we passed the other two things I'm trying to get done, we will, in fact, reduce inflation. Reduce inflation. Reduce inflation—because we're going to be providing good opportunities and jobs for people who, in fact, are going to be reinvesting that money back into all the things we're talking about, driving down prices, not raising prices.</p>, <p>And so it is—I sincerely mean this: Prices are up now, and they're up in—for example, you're in a position where you're trying to build a house, trying to find two-by-fours and lumber. Well, guess what? People stopped working cutting lumber. They stopped doing it because they—the unemployment was so down. Now, all of a sudden, there's this need because people are coming back. And guess what? Instead of paying 10 cents, you're paying 20. But you understand what I'm saying.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> It relates to what, in fact, is now needed because we're growing. I don't know anybody, including Larry Summers—who's a friend of mine—who's worried about inflation, is suggesting that there's any long-term march here if we do the things we're going to do.</p>, <p>For example, if we get this build on that I've been—put together a long time ago—and, by the way, I want to say, I'm in his territory. You know, there's—Portman is a good man. Portman is a Congressman from this area. I talked to him before I got—and I really mean it. He's a decent, honorable man, and he and I are working on trying to get this infrastructure bill passed.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> But you're—you're talking about Senator Rob Portman of Ohio?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, I'm sorry. I——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> No, but——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I thought they'd know that. I apologize.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Yes, but—no, since you—you mention that infrastructure, the bipartisan infrastructure deal failed the procedural vote today. Right?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> But—no——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> In the Senate today.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, it did. But that's irrelevant.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Go on. Okay.</p>, <p>In the Senate, negotiators say that they need more time.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Okay. So then—but they're expected to vote again on Monday, but how much time do you think that they need to get this done?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Till Monday. [<i>Laughter</i>] Look—no, I'm not being facetious. I'm not being facetious. You had up to 20 Republicans sign a letter saying: ""We think we need this deal. We think we need this deal."" And so I think there'll be—by the way, the reason we're talking this way: We need 60 votes to get something moving. And what's going to happen is, I believe—because I take my Republican colleagues at my—at their word when you shake. I come from a tradition in the Senate: You shake your hand. That's it. You keep your word.</p>, <p>And I found Rob Portman does that. I found that—you know, your Governor is a good man. You shake his hand, it's done. [<i>Applause</i>] No, I really mean that. I'm not—I'm not being falsely complimentary.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Do you think it's going to move forward in the Senate on Monday?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I do. Here's what I think: What happens is, the vote on Monday is a motion to be able to proceed to this issue. Then they're going to debate the issue of the elements—the individual elements of this plan to make sure we're going to fix that damn bridge of yours going into Kentucky. [<i>Applause</i>] No, I'm serious.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> We're going to talk about that bridge in just a moment. We asked—[<i>inaudible</i>] about that bridge.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Anyway. But I think it's going to get done.</p>, <p>You may find in the amendments that take place on the detail—the detail—of whether or not—and I'm the guy that wrote this bill to begin with, and so I've had to compromise to make changes in the bill. When I say ""I,"" I campaigned on this. I mean, everybody thought I was a little nuts when I talked about there are three reasons why I was running: one, to restore the soul of this country and bring back some decency; two, to build back the middle class because they've been getting really knocked around a long time. They're the backbone that unite the country.</p>, <p>And one of the big issues was dealing with infrastructure. Remember, the last 4 years we had ""Infrastructure Week"" every week. [<i>Laughter</i>] We didn't do a thing. But it's necessary. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, I really mean it. It's going to not only increase job opportunities, it's going to increase commerce. It's going to—it's a good thing, and I think we're going to get it done.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> A lot of this stuff you're going need—you need bipartisan support. So let's talk about that.</p>, <p>Our next question comes from Cindy Peebles. She's a financial executive and a Democrat. Go ahead, Cindy.</p>, <p><i>The President's Commitment to Bipartisanship </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Hello, Mr. President. I am dismayed at how often Democratic plans for stabilizing the economy or shoring up new strains of the virus are held hostage by the utopian need to gain bipartisan support. It appears, at every turn, the Democratic plan is weakened and still secures zero Republican votes. Sometimes, the opposition is just wrong, and working to get them to agree with you is fruitless. Why is the strategy to abandon the need for bipartisanship not the right answer?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, look, I may be the wrong guy to talk to because I spent a lot of time as a Senator and Vice President, and I'm going to say something outrageous: I don't know you'll find any Republican I've ever worked with who says I ever broke my word, didn't do exactly what I said I would do and keep my word.</p>, <p>And I was able to get an awful lot of compromises put together to do really good things, to change things. And I still believe that's possible.</p>, <p>But the well has been so poisoned over the last 4 years. And even now, there's still this lingering effort. A lot of my Republican friends—and I'm not talking about Portman; I'm not talking about your Governor—a lot of my Republican friends say: ""Joe, I know you're right, but if I do this, I'll get primaried, and I'll lose my primary. I'll be in trouble.""</p>, <p>But I think that's all beginning to move. I don't mean overnight. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not playing out some panacea here. But I think people are figuring out that if we want to—I've always found you get rewarded for doing what you think at the time is the right thing, and people really believe you believe it's the right thing to do.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And so I think you're seeing it coming together. And by the way, the compromises are—you know, are real, compromise within my own party between the far left and the center and some of the folks who are more conservative. That's coming together. They said that would never happen, but if you notice, it has happened.</p>, <p><i>Congressional Committee on the January 6 Civil Unrest and Violence at the U.S. Capitol/Tenor of Political Rhetoric </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Well, let's talk a little bit more about bipartisanship. You know, the Republicans removed all their picks today for the January 6 committee, the select committee. Nancy Pelosi rejected two of them.</p>, <p>The first thing I want to ask you is, what's your reaction to that? But number two, if Republicans and Democrats can't come together—right?—to investigate the biggest attack on our Capitol in 200 years, what makes you think that they can come together on anything?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> These people. [<i>Applause</i>] No, I mean it. I'm not being facetious. Democrats and Republicans. I don't care if you think I'm Satan reincarnated. [<i>Laughter</i>] The fact is, you can't look at that television and say, ""Nothing happened on the 6th."" You can't listen to people who say this was a ""peaceful march."" No, I'm serious. Think about it. Think of the things being said.</p>, <p>I've been through the other end of this when the Democrats, 35 years ago, were way off to the other side. Think about it.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> But what you can do though—what they can do is try to change the narrative and say: ""Well, why wasn't Nancy Pelosi prepared? Why weren't the Democrats prepared for that to happen?""</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, no, they can say that, and you can make honest judgments about it. I have—look, I sometimes get myself in trouble for what I'm about to say—[<i>laughter</i>]—not that I ever get in trouble. [<i>Laughter</i>] As you've heard me say before: No one ever doubts I mean what I say; the problem is, I sometimes say all that I mean. And—[<i>laughter</i>].</p>, <p>But all kidding aside, I have faith in the American people—I really do—to ultimately get to the right place. And by the way, many times Republicans are in the right place. I don't mean that the Republicans—that it's always the Democratic point of view.</p>, <p>But some of the stuff—I mean, QAnon: The idea that the Democrats or that Biden is hiding people and sucking the blood of children and doing—no, I'm serious. That's—now, you may not like me, and that's your right. Look, it's a simple thing. You can walk out and say: ""I just don't like the way that guy wears his tie. I'm voting against him."" You have a right to do that. You have a right to do that.</p>, <p>But the kinds of things that are being said of late, I think you're beginning to see some of the—and both—and by Democrats as well—sort of the venom get—sort of leak out a lot of it. We got to get beyond this. What do you say to your grandchildren or you children about what's happening? Do you ever remember a time like this before, in the entire history, whether you're Democrat or Republican?</p>, <p>This is not who we are. And I'll say one last thing—and you're going to—I've had a lot of experience internationally. And I mean that—not good or bad, just I have; I've chaired the Foreign Relations Committee. I've been deeply involved. I did national security for the—our last—the administration with Barack.</p>, <p>But, folks, the rest of the world is wondering about us. Those of you who travel abroad—not a joke, not a joke—you ask—you know, when I went to this G-7, all the major democracies—I walked in—and I know a lot of them because of my role in the past. And they walk in, and I said, ""America is back."" And they go—I'm serious, heads of state—I give you my word as a Biden—said: ""Are you really back? I mean, how can I—we believe you, Joe, but will the country ever get it together?""</p>, <p>I talked to Xi—Xi Jinping of China, who I know well. We don't agree on a lot of things. He's a bright and really tough guy. He truly believes that the 21st century will be determined by oligarchs, by—and I'm not—not a joke. Democracies cannot function in the 21st century—the argument is—because things are moving so rapidly—so, so rapidly—that you can't pull together a nation that is divided to get a consensus on acting quickly.</p>, <p>So autocrats—autocracies—I had a long meeting with Putin, and I continued—I know him well. These guys actually are betting—betting, I'm not joking—on autocracies. Democracy has to stand up and demonstrate it can get something done. It's not just important that we are—[<i>applause</i>]—no, I really mean it.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Mr. President, we're just getting started. We've got a lot to talk about.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm sorry.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> No, no, no. You're good. We're going to take a quick break, and we're going to come back with more questions for the President of the United States right after this.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, there was a commercial break.</i>]</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Welcome back, everyone. We are live at a CNN town hall in Cincinnati, Ohio, with the President of the United States.</p>, <p>Straight to the audience for a question. This is John Lanni. He is the owner and cofounder of a restaurant group with 39 restaurants across the country, Mr. President. He is a Republican.</p>, <p>John.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Hi there, Mr. President.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Hey, John.</p>, <p><i>Coronavirus Pandemic Impacts on Restaurant Industry/Changes in the Labor Market </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Hi. Thank you for taking my question tonight. We employ hundreds of hard-working team members throughout the State of Ohio and across the country. And we're looking to hire more every day as we try to restart our restaurant business.</p>, <p>The entire industry, amongst other industries, continue to struggle to find employees. How do you and the Biden administration plan to incentivize those that haven't returned to work yet? Hiring is our top priority right now.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, two things. One, if you notice, we kept you open. We spent billions of dollars to make sure restaurants could stay open. And a lot of people who now—who worked as waiters and waitresses decided that they don't want to do that anymore because there's other opportunities at higher wages, because there's a lot of openings now in jobs. And people are beginning to move—beginning to move.</p>, <p>There's some evidence that maintaining the ability to continue not—to not have your—have to pay your rent so you don't get thrown out, and being able to provide for unemployment insurance, has kept people from going back to work. There's no—not much distinction between not going back to work in a restaurant and not going back to work at a factory. So people are looking to change opportunities, change what they're doing.</p>, <p>My—my deceased wife's father-in-law was a restaurateur up in Syracuse, New York. And by the way, he tried to—he had a—had a restaurant that was in a town called Auburn, about 20,000 people, which was at a flagship 24-hour-a-day restaurant that—and he offered it to me, which I would have been making five times what I would in law school to try to keep me in Syracuse.</p>, <p>But I spent too many times at home hearing a—in his home, hearing a phone call: ""The cook didn't come in? He's in a fight with his wife? What's going on?""</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Exactly.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> So I would—God love you doing what you do.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>It's tough.</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>But all kidding aside, I think it really is a matter of people deciding now that they have opportunities to do other things. And there is a shortage of employees. People are looking to make more money and to bargain. And so I think your business and the tourist business is really going to be in a—in a bind for a little while. And one of the things—we're ending all those things that are the things keeping people back from going back to work, et cetera.</p>, <p>It will be interesting to see what happens, but my gut tells me—my gut tells me—that part of it relates to—you know, you can make a good salary as a waiter or waitress. One of my sister-in-laws is—of five sisters—makes a very good salary. She works in Atlantic City. That's where she's—she's from. But it is—there's a lot of people who—who are looking to change their occupation, I think. But I could be wrong.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Well, let me ask you, because he's—John is looking to hire people. He's got 39 restaurants across the country.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Federal Assistance to Restaurant Industry/Changes in Labor Market </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Is there anything you can do to help him out? I mean, he's got to get people in.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, John—first of all, I—you know, the thing we did to help John and the Johns out is provide billions of dollars to make sure they could stay open. Number one. So you all contributed to making sure John could stay in business. [<i>Applause</i>] And we should. We should have done that, as we did for other industries.</p>, <p>But secondly, John, my guess is that people being $7, $8 an hour, plus tips, that's—I think, John, you're going to be finding—15 bucks an hour or more now. You know what I mean? But you may pay that already. You may pay that already.</p>, <p><i>Unemployment Insurance/Education </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Well, let me—let me ask you, because everywhere I go, there isn't pretty much a shop in my town, a restaurant or whatever, where there isn't a ""For Hire"" sign.</p>, <p>We were trying to check into the hotel; they couldn't get the rooms cleaned fast enough because they can't find staff. You mentioned something—you said, ""We're going to end the things that may be keeping people back."" You think that's the unemployment benefits expanded?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, that was the argument it was. I don't think it did much. But the point is, it's argued that because the extended unemployment benefits kept people—they'd rather stay home and not work—than go to work.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> You don't think it hurt? Did that?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I see no evidence it had any serious impact on it. But you can argue—let's assume it did. It's coming to an end, so it's not like we're in a situation where—if that was it and it ends, then we're going to see John is going to have no problem.</p>, <p>But what I think is happening, folks, is, look, if you make less than 15—and I'm not saying, John, your folks make less than 15—you had good restaurants; that means their tips are good, people make a lot more than just what the—what the minimum wage—what the wage is being paid on with the—if you put tips on top of it.</p>, <p>But, folks, look, here's the deal. Think about it: You know, if you have an—we—for example, I want to be able to—one of my programs is to make sure that we have 4 more years of school that's free—2 years for 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds, because it's demonstrated that that increases significantly success, and community college.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, those folks are not likely to want to go and be waiters. There's nothing wrong being a waiter or waitress. My family has been engaged in that business. But the folks is—and lastly, if you make less than 15 bucks an hour working 40 hours a week, you're living below the poverty level. You're living below the poverty level.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> I want to continue on and talk about—this has to do with infrastructure, because you got applause when you mentioned the bridge earlier—[<i>laughter</i>]—and—</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> By the way, your Congressman wants that bridge too. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Todd Michael is here. He's a union electrician and a Democrat. He has a question about something that a lot of people in Cincinnati are concerned about.</p>, <p>Todd, take it away.</p>, <p><i>Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation/Economic Growth </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>As Mr. Lemon said, you have already touched on the subject of my question. The two most recent Presidents—past Presidents—had both campaigned using this region's Interstate 75 Bridge—the Brent Spence Bridge that crosses the Iowa River—as backdrops with a promise of an infrastructure bill that would help with the replacement.</p>, <p>President Biden, is it possible to bring Congress together to pass an infrastructure bill that builds a bridge that does not just benefit this region, but the entire I-75 corridor, from Michigan all the way to Florida?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> The answer is absolutely, positively yes. I'm not just saying that. [<i>Applause</i>] I'm not just saying that. And if you take a look at Ohio and Kentucky combined, there's well over—there's thousands of bridges that need repair. Thousands. Thousands of bridges.</p>, <p>And we should be looking at it this way: It increases commerce, number one. But guess what? They're good-paying union jobs. Union. [<i>Applause</i>] Union jobs.</p>, <p>And by the way, can you ever think of a time—those of you who are economists, who are—who teach here, economics—can you think of any time when the middle class did better, the wealthy didn't do really well?</p>, <p>I'm not being facetious now. I'm being deadly earnest. Can you think of any time that's occurred when the middle class does better? I'm tired of trickle down. I come from the corporate State of America.</p>, <p>And by the way, I think you should be able to go out and make a billion dollars or a hundred million dollars if you have the capacity to do it. But I ask one thing: Pay your fair share. [<i>Applause</i>] Just pay your fair share. I really mean it. And if you know anything about me, check it out: We have more corporations registered in Delaware than all the rest of America combined. Combined. Combined. I represented it for 36 years. I've never seen a time when we have the middle class growing that the wealthy didn't do very, very, very well.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> So that's what we have to do: Build it out and up, not just down.</p>, <p><i>Mr. </i>Yes. So that people like our next guest—who just graduated from law school, by the way—his name is Cory Marcum. He's a graduate from the University of Cincinnati Law School. And he——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> He's a graduate, huh?</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Excuse me, he's heading to law school—I'm wrong—in the fall.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Yes. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> So, Cory, good luck in law school. And what's your question?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Your first year—you wish you had already graduated. [<i>Laughter</i>] I know. I—me too.</p>, <p><i>Election Reform Legislation/Use of the Filibuster in the Senate </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Yes. [<i>Laughter</i>] So my question is: Last week, regarding the GOP's efforts to restrict voting rights, you said those efforts were, quote, ""the most dangerous threat to voting and the integrity of free and fair elections in our history,"" end quote. While you have condemned these attacks, you and congressional Members of your party have done little to actually stop these assaults. If these efforts are really the most dangerous in our history, isn't it logical to get rid of the filibuster so we can protect our democracy and secure the right to vote?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I stand by what I said. Never before has there been an attempt by State legislatures to take over the ability to determine who won. Not count the votes, determine who won.</p>, <p>We have election officials across the board that they're deciding to push out of the way. And if in fact tomorrow—let's say we're running last time, and we're—these laws had been in effect that are—these changes. In Georgia, the Georgia legislature—you know, Biden won by multiple thousand votes; they could say, ""We don't think it was legit."" And the State legislature votes, ""We're going send electors up to Congress to vote for Trump, not Biden."" That's never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever been tried before. This is Jim Crow on steroids what we're talking about.</p>, <p>And so it takes—to go to your second point, I've been saying for a long, long time: The abuse of the filibuster is pretty overwhelming. When I got to the United States Senate at a time when we had guys like Jim Eastland and Strom Thurmond and Robert F. Byrd and a whole range of people who were very, very, very, very, very, very conservative on race, to say the least—even then, if you were to filibuster, you had to stand on the floor and hold the floor. And that's why Strom, I think, set the record at 24 straight hours or something. Don't hold me to the number. But you know, so you had to take—there were significantly fewer filibusters in those days. In the middle of the civil rights movement.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> But let me talk to you about that.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, let me finish my answer, because I'll tell you what I'd do. I would go back to that where you have to maintain the floor. You have to stand there and talk and hold the floor. You can't just say that now.</p>, <p><i>Voting Rights Legislation/Bipartisanship/2020 Presidential and Congressional Elections </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> I understand that. But what difference is that if you hold the floor for, you know, a day or a year? What difference does it make?</p>, <p>Here's the thing for me: You talked about people—and this is important for people who look like me. My grandmother would sit around when I was a kid, fifth grade—had a fifth-grade education. I learned that she couldn't read when I was doing my homework. And she would tell me stories about people asking her to count the number of jellybeans in the jar or the soap.</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>Yes.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> And so why is protecting the filibuster—is that more important than protecting voting rights, especially for people who fought and died for that?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No. It's not. I want to see the United States Congress, the United States Senate, pass S. 1 and S. 4, the John Lewis Act, and get it on my desk so I can sign it.</p>, <p>But here's the deal: What I also want to do—I want to make sure we bring along not just all the Democrats; we bring along Republicans, who I know know better. They know better than this.</p>, <p>And what I don't want to do is get wrapped up, right now, in the argument of whether or not this is all about the filibuster or all—look, the American public, you can't stop them from voting. You tried last time. More people voted last time than any time in American history, in the middle of the worst pandemic in American history. More people did. And they showed up. They're going to show up again. They're going to do it again.</p>, <p>But what I want to do is, I'm trying to bring the country together. And I don't want the debate to only be about whether or not we have a filibuster or exceptions to the filibuster or the—going back to the way the filibuster had to be used before.</p>, <p><i>Use of the Filibuster in the Senate/Voting Rights Legislation/Child Tax Credit Relief Payments </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> But isn't that the only way you're going to get it done right now?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I don't believe that. I think we can get it done.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> If you—you agree with the former President; he has called—as you call him, your ""old boss""—that it's ""a relic of Jim Crow.""</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> It is.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> If it's a relic of Jim Crow, it's been used to fight against civil rights legislation historically, why protect it?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> There's no reason to protect it other than, you're going to throw the entire Congress into chaos and nothing will get done.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Right.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Nothing at all will get done.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>And there's a lot at stake. The most important one is the right to vote. That's the single most important one. And your vote counted and counted by someone who honestly counts it.</p>, <p>But it goes beyond that. For example, wouldn't—wouldn't my friends on the other side love to have a debate about the filibuster instead of passing the recovery act? Or wouldn't they love doing it instead of being in a position where we provide for—how many of you have children under the age of 17? Raise your hand. Guess what? You're getting a lot of money in a monthly check now, aren't you? [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>No, you deserve—no, no, no, I really mean it. Republicans used to fight for it as well. It's called the child tax credit. If you have a child under the age of seven, you get 300 bucks a month—350 bucks a month. If you have a child under—between 7 and 17, you get a total of 200 bucks a month. And guess what? It's cutting child poverty in half. In half.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Mr. President, I want to talk about something else that affects people a lot, and to children as well. The next question—and it's about gun violence. This is from a paralegal, and she's an advocate. Her name is Andrea Solis Canto. She's a Democrat.</p>, <p>Andrea, go ahead.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I used to be a public defender, kid. [<i>Laughter</i>] Thanks for what you're doing.</p>, <p><i>Gun Violence Prevention/Crime Rate/Police Reform Efforts/Community Policing </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>[<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you. So gun violence has been on the rise across the country, and as a recent student and young professional living in Over-the-Rhine, I've seen this firsthand. Gun violence has taken the lives of so many young students and young people. I'm tired, and I want to see change that's going to make our cities, like Cincinnati, safer.</p>, <p>So how will you address gun violence, from a Federal point of view, to actually bring about change and make our local cities safer?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Now, I'm not being a wise guy. There's no reason you should—have you seen my gun violence legislation I've introduced? As you know—because you're so involved—actually, crime is down; gun violence and murder rates are up. Guns. I'm the only guy that ever got passed legislation, when I was a Senator, that made sure we eliminated assault weapons. The idea you need a weapon that can have the ability to fire 20, 30, 40, 50, 120 shots from that weapon—whether it's a 9-millimeter pistol or whether it's a rifle—is ridiculous.</p>, <p>I'm continuing to push to eliminate the sale of those things, but I'm not likely to get that done in the near term. So here's what I've done: The people who, in fact, are using those weapons are acquiring them illegally—illegally. And so what happens is, I've gotten ATF—Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms—I have them increase their budget and increase their capacity, along with the Justice Department, to go after the gun shops that are not abiding by the law of doing background checks. For real. That's number one.</p>, <p>Number two—number two—we're in a position where you—most of the cities—and I don't know enough—I think you've had a lot of gun violence here in Cincinnati. I think it was up to—what?—how many how dead? Five hundred over a period. Don't hold me to the number—whatever it was. But my point is, all across the country. And it's not because the gun shops in the cities are selling these guns. They are either shadow gun dealers and/or gun shops that are not abiding by the law.</p>, <p>So we're going to do major investigations and shut those guys down and put some of them in jail and—for what they're doing: selling these weapons. There's also a thing called ""ghost guns"" that are being sold now and being used.</p>, <p>And so—but in addition to that, what we have to do is we have to deal with a larger problem of the whole issue of law enforcement, generally. We're in a situation where, as much as we need to pass the Floyd Act and all that—but here's the deal: Cops are having real trouble. They're not all bad guys; there are a lot of good guys. We need more policemen, not fewer policemen. But we need them involved in community policing. Community policing.</p>, <p>And when we did that, violent crime went down. All the criticism about the original crime bill—well, guess what? Crime went down until we stopped doing community policing. So it's about getting—we have availability now of over a billion—lots of money for cops to be able to hire psychologists, psychiatrists, as well as social workers to be engaged in the process.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Mr. President, we're going to put a period, maybe a comma right here, because we have more to come. We've got to take a quick break.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm sorry.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> We'll be right back. More from President Joe Biden right after this. [Applause.]</p>, <p>[<i>There was a commercial break.</i>]</p>, <p><i>Police Reform Efforts/Community Policing </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Welcome back to our CNN town hall with the President of the United States, Joe Biden. I just—I said we were going to put a comma on it because I want to continue this conversation.</p>, <p>You said that you need—we need more police, right? Your words. So then, how do you respond to Republicans who try to paint you and your party as antipolice?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> They're lying. [<i>Applause</i>] No, look, never once—we have to change police conduct. We have to have rules where things are open. We have to have rules where you can be able to determine what the background—how many times a cop has violated the rules and be able to have access to what's going on in police departments, or the Justice Department can get involved in whether or not they have to change their pattern of practices.</p>, <p>I've always said that.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> But what about defunding the police though? Because there's a ""Defund the Police.""</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I've never, never, never said defunding the police.</p>, <p>Look, I don't know any community, particularly the communities that are in the most need and the poorest and the most at risk, that don't want police. They want police, though, to look at them as equals. They want police to treat them in a way. They don't want police abusing.</p>, <p>And what happened was we got in the position where—we used to have community policing where the cop—my deceased son was the attorney general of the State of Delaware. And what we did when that original bill got passed was, he would go down in the tough neighborhoods in my State—in my city of Wilmington, which is overwhelming a minority city, and he'd go where the—everybody can tell me where the best basketball is played in a playground here in this city. You know where it is; you know who the best ballplayers are; you know where they are.</p>, <p>He'd go down and sit there on the bench with his son, my grandson, who's now 16, when he was 5 and 6 years old, and let them know he was there. He'd go over and knock on the window of the local cop, who was sitting there by himself in a squad car. He'd say: ""Get out of the car. Meet people.""</p>, <p>Because what used to happen was cops used to—when first community policing came about—they'd go in and they knew who the minister was in the church, they knew who owned the local liquor store, the local drugstore, the local grocery store. And they'd walk in and say: ""Look, I'm Joe Biden, and I'm going to be in this beat. Here's my cell number. You have a problem, call me. Here's my cell number.""</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> You said it's tough right now. You said police are up against—well, they're up against the narrative that, you know, the country is antipolice, Democrats are antipolice, Joe Biden is antipolice. And then, you have——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> They aren't saying Joe Biden is antipolice. Cops are not saying that about Joe Biden. They know me, period.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Go on.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> They're not saying. Republicans are saying it on the far—I'm not going to—anyway, it doesn't matter.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> No, you can—no, I want you to talk about this, because—I mean——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, look——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon. </i>——it's an important narrative. There is no more important issue, I think, right now than safety. You can rebuild a home. You can, you know, get a lot of things back. But, Mr. President, you cannot get back a life. And it——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That's exactly right. That's exactly right.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Yes. And if police aren't doing their jobs, that increases——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Okay—no, if police aren't doing their job, they should be held accountable. They should be fired if they're not doing their job. They should—I have no—I make no excuses for that.</p>, <p>We should have, for example, the George Floyd Act, where chokeholds are against the law, where a whole lot of things that are laid out in that legislation. And by the way, I grew up in a neighborhood where you became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest. I wasn't qualified for any one of them, so here I am. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But all kidding aside—I'm not joking—the guys that grew up in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware—a steel town—that's what we did. That's what they did. It's what my friends did.</p>, <p>And here's the point: The point is that they—it doesn't justify maltreating the public. You have no right to do that. None. But now what's happening is, because they've become—it's become so tough across the spectrum, we've actually cut down on a number of police, unrelated to anybody asking for it. The towns and cities aren't spending as much money on it. There is not as much Federal money to hire police. And now what's happening is, police are not wanting to be a cop. Raise your hand if you want to be a cop now. What do you think, huh?</p>, <p>So what we got to do is, we got to give them the help they need to be better at their job. The idea that you have someone sitting on a ledge, saying they're going to jump off a ledge, and you call the cop, and sending a guy or a woman who's a law enforcement officer, has a criminal justice degree, when you could send with him or her—you could send with them a psychologist or a social worker or somebody who can talk to them.</p>, <p><i>Audience member.</i> Yes!</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I mean it. I'm serious.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon. </i>Mr. President, I want to get to more questions now. I'm going to bring in Lynne Miller. She's an attorney and a Democrat.</p>, <p>Lynne, what's your question?</p>, <p><i>Opioid Crisis/Accountability Efforts for the Pharmaceutical Industry </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, the opioid crisis continues, and in this part of the country, it remains a huge problem. While the overprescription of opioids is part of that problem, the drugs available in the black market are a growing issue as many of these contain fentanyl. That took the life of our son. How can your administration combat the issue of illegal opiates, many of which our young people buy online? Someone should bear responsibility for delivering death through the mail.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> They should bear responsibility. You may or may not be aware: Even in the period when I was out of office, I was railing against the fact that drug companies were selling on the open market. There was one case, which really got me, was, you had two drugstores in small town in West Virginia having something like prescription for 4,000 pills. And it was obviously drug trafficking. That's what was going on.</p>, <p>So what we did was—what they did was, they went after it. They just settled with Johnson and—some of the drug companies who make opioids for twenty-six—was it $26 billion or 27. Today, if I'm not mistaken, the settlement took place.</p>, <p>But here's the deal: In addition to that, you have the Chinese sending fentanyl to Mexico, in large part, that's being mixed with opioids and/or heroin and other drugs, which is a dead-set killer of people.</p>, <p>And so what we have to do—I've had this encounter with China, and we're going to continue it. But we've also increased the number of DEA agents—what we're doing at the border—and how we're going to deal with the intercepting that drug trade.</p>, <p>In addition to that, the Justice Department is moving on dealing with the whole opioid issue by increasing significantly the number—the number of people in Justice Department working on this issue. And so there's much more to say about it, but it is incredibly, incredibly dangerous.</p>, <p><i>Addiction Rehabilitation Programs/Ex-Convict Reintegration Programs </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Mr. President, I believe there's no better way to speak about this than——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm sorry, I'm——</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon. </i>——from experience. I don't think there's probably a family in this room who hasn't been affected by addiction. You've been very open about your son Hunter's problems with addiction. This is personal for you. And listen, I've dealt with it in—within my own family. Every family deals with it. But this is personal for you.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. And I'm so damn proud of my son. My son just wrote a book about how he overcame being addicted. And he did it, and he's doing it, and he is in good shape, thank God.</p>, <p>Here's the thing: We don't have nearly enough people involved in mental health and drug addiction services—number one. Number one.</p>, <p>Number two—number two, we shouldn't be sending people to jail for use; we should be sending them to mandatory rehabilitation. Mandatory rehabilitation.</p>, <p>Number three, when people are in fact in jail, they should be getting—if that's not the main crime, but they also did—they should be getting treatment while they are in jail.</p>, <p>Fourth, when people get out of jail—whether it's for drug addiction or any other crime—if they've served their time, they should have full access to everything from Pell grants, to public housing, to the like.</p>, <p>And by the way—[<i>applause</i>]—and by the way, folks, it's not just the right thing to do; it's the smart thing for us to do. Because what happens? Years ago, there was a guy named Arlen Specter from Pennsylvania. He and I introduced legislation that was a second chance. It would—meant that, right now, when you get out of jail in most prisons in the States around the country—what happens?—you get a bus ticket and 25 bucks. You end up under the bridge, just like you did before. You're almost—almost guaranteed to get back in whatever your problem was before.</p>, <p>So they should have access to drug treatment. They should have access to housing. They should have access to whatever they qualify based on their income. And we should, in prisons as well, be training people differently.</p>, <p>But the big thing here is: We have to deal with the idea of addiction by providing for what we all know—it's a disease of the brain.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> It's a disease of the brain and has to be treated as such.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> I think it's—I think addiction and mental health issues have to be dealt with, just as if you break your arm and go to the doctor. We should be able to talk to that. There should be——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I agree.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon. —</i>—there shouldn't be a stigma about it.</p>, <p>I want to bring in now Madeena Nolan. Madeena Nolan is a writer and editor. She's a Democrat.</p>, <p>Madeena, what's your question?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Hi, Madeena.</p>, <p><i>Refugee Admission Policy/Migrants From Central America/Evacuation of Afghan Interpreters and Other Service Contractors Who Assisted With U.S. Military Operations in Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Good evening, Mr. President. Vice President Harris said to Guatemalans, ""Don't come."" Recently, you have indicated you are in favor of refugees coming to this country. Could you please explain your administration's basic stance on immigration?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. They should not come.</p>, <p>What we're trying to set up is, in the countries like in—and particularly in the Northern Triangle: Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, et cetera—we are setting up in those countries: If you seek asylum in the United States, you can seek it from the country, from your—in place. You can seek it from an American Embassy. You can go in and seek and see whether or not you qualify. We've significantly increased the number of officers who can hear cases as to whether or not you qualify under the law for being here as a refugee. That is—that's what we've done.</p>, <p>Thirdly, we have enabled a move, significantly, to change the number—there were thousands of people in custody with the Border Patrol. It's now cut by 90 percent, where there—it's considerably down.</p>, <p>What I do say is: The one place you may heard that I'm talking about more immigrants coming in are those folks from Afghanistan who helped the American soldiers, who will be—they and their family will be victimized very badly as a consequence of what happens if they're left behind. And so we're providing for them to be able to see whether they qualify to meet this special requirement to be able to come to the United States as a refugee and as, ultimately, earning citizenship here. It seems to me it's the only decent thing that we can do.</p>, <p>In the meantime, we're going to send people to American bases, where they're not going to be able to leave the base while their cases are being determined—whether they qualify—and also other bases.</p>, <p><i>Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Policy Beneficiaries </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> I want to talk to you about DACA. I've got two questions on immigration. They're quick questions I want to ask you about. Because just last week, there was a Federal judge who ruled the program unlawful, blocked it from accepting new applications. What do you say to DREAMers who are really worried about their futures here in the United States?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm not letting this go. Look, guys, let's just put it—[<i>applause</i>]—let's just put this—you know, we talk about DREAMers sort of generically. Let's think about it now, what it really means: You're 5 years old. You're 9 years old. Your mom or your dad says, ""I'm going to take you across the Rio Grande and we're going to illegally going to go into the United States."" What are you supposed to say? ""Not me. That's against the law""? I'm—no, I'm being—I'm being deadly earnest. What can a kid say? What could they do? They come here with really no choice. And they're here, and they're good, good people. They've done well. Ten thousand of them were first-line workers. These are kids who've done well.</p>, <p>And so what we're going to do is, first of all, appeal the case—number one. But number two, we're going to make sure that—a number of my Republican colleagues say they support the right of DREAMers to come. Let's call the question. They should be able to stay in the United States of America when a child comes in—[<i>inaudible</i>].</p>, <p><i>The President's First Six Months in Office/Prestige of the Office/Daily Life in the White House/U.S. Global Leadership </i></p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Mr. President, you've been the big guy for 6 months now in the White House. Can you take us behind the scenes, something that was extraordinary or unusual that happened that stands out to you?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. ""Mr. President, you didn't close the door. Mr. President, what the hell are you going out at this time for?"" You know. [<i>Laughter</i>] You know, it's a wonderful honor. As you can tell, I hope I have very good manners, but I'm not very hung up on protocol. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And I—and the Secret Service is wonderful. And because things are so crazy out there, it is very hard to get comfortable like I would ordinarily be. For example, I think all of the help that's there, providing meals and all the rest—I think they love us. We can say: ""Don't come in for breakfast. We can get our own breakfast."" Because I like to walk out in my robe and go in. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, no, I'm not—you think I'm joking. I'm not. You know what I mean?</p>, <p>And so it's just a—you know, the only place I have felt like what the office connotes is when I went to Europe and watched the rest of the heads of state react to me—not me, because I'm the President of the United States of America—the United States of America.</p>, <p>And here's what happened: It's the first time I ever felt like—you always hear say ""leader of the free world."" Well, I realize, when I'm sitting across from Putin, who I know, he knows who I am; I know who he is. He knows I mean what I say and can do what I say. He understands. It doesn't mean he will do it or not do it. But the point is, it's the first time I've ever felt the notion that I am in the office that is the leader of the free world. And we must be the leader of the free world. If we don't do it, nobody good is likely to do it or has the capacity to do it. I really mean it. I genuinely mean it.</p>, <p>So it's the thing, Don, that is the only time—and by the way, the first time I walked downstairs and they played ""Hail to the Chief,"" I wondered, ""Where is he?"" [<i>Laughter</i>] No, you think I'm kidding. I'm not kidding. You know, I mean—</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> It's a great tune, isn't it?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> It's a great tune, but I—you know, you feel a little self-conscious. [<i>Laughter</i>] But you think I'm kidding. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm not.</p>, <p>But I am not at all self-conscious about the power that goes with the office as it relates to resolving issues. These are issues that I've dealt with my whole life. Whether I'm good or bad, I have more experience coming to the office than anyone who's ever held that office. I have done—I've been deeply steeped in foreign policy, the justice system, the economic—not that I'm right. I don't mean that.</p>, <p>But nothing has come before me where I've gone, ""Oh, my God, I never—I never thought""—you know, what the difference is—I used to kid Barack—who's a good friend—President Obama. And you know, at one point, I'd always be the—I was always the last guy in the room, for real. On every important decision, I got to give my advice. I'd give it all away, but I'd be the last guy before I walked out. And one day, he thanked me. And I said, ""Mr. President, here's the deal: I should be paying you, not you me, because I get to give the advice, and then I get to leave."" [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>No, I'm serious. Think about it. The one thing that is real, that is different—I don't—and I feel comfortable with it—but is, you're the last guy in the room.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> You decide: ""Is the decision I'm about to make, will that cause war? Will that cause conflict? The decision I'm about to make, is that going to hurt people? Is it going to help people?"" That's the part that is different.</p>, <p>But the living conditions, I mean, it's such a great, great honor to live in the White House. But, quite frankly—I kid the Vice President—like, one day, Barack came over to NAVOBS—it's called Naval Operations—the Vice President's Residence—which is on about, I guess, 80, 90 acres. And it's a beautiful, beautiful spot. And there's a fence around the whole property.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> I'll bet you miss that, don't you?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I do. [<i>Laughter</i>] And Barack came over and he said, ""This is great."" And I said, ""I'll tell you""—and I said, ""Trade you only if the power goes with it.""</p>, <p>But the point is that, there, it was totally different. You could walk out in your shorts—with a short-sleeve shirt on, and you can walk around, and there wasn't anybody there. You can't walk out anywhere now. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I'm not complaining. I'm trying to answer your question as honestly as I can.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I just—it's the greatest honor, I think, could ever be bestowed on an American that a majority of American citizens said, ""I want you to lead the country."" And it's a great honor—a great honor—when you have Presidents and Prime Ministers and the rest of the world saying, ""You know, what does the United States think?"" You're the leader of the free world.</p>, <p>I was able to go to the G-7 and change their mind about a whole range of things. They never once had included China in any criticism on what was going on. They're very reluctant to be able to be in a position—you and I have talked about this—about whether or not they're going to do business with China in a way that, you know, pushes America aside.</p>, <p>All of a sudden, if you notice, we're getting a great deal—not because of me, but because of the administration I put together. And America is back; traditional America is more back. And they're willing to follow us, I think.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Well, Mr. President—Mr. President, here's the deal. Mr. President, here's the deal: I'm the last guy that gets to ask you questions tonight.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Uh-oh.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> Yes. And then, I get to leave. [<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Thanks, man.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> I appreciate it.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Appreciate it.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Lemon.</i> We're so glad that you guys are here and that you got to ask questions to the President of the United States. Thank you so much.</p>, <p>Thank you to our audience, for everyone, for being here taking questions. Of course, thank you to the President of the United States. And we want to thank Mount St. Joseph University right here in Cincinnati, Ohio—right?—for housing us.</p>]"

15,4,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Prior to a Cabinet Meeting,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-cabinet-meeting-12,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Well, look, today—today's Cabinet meeting, I want to give a brief progress report as to where I think we are and the job you're doing in the first 6 months.</p>, <p>First, the pandemic. I know folks are watching the number of cases rising again and wondering, quite frankly, what it means to them. But overall—overall—COVID-19 deaths are down dramatically. Dramatically. And these last 6 months, about 90-percent down due to our vaccination program. And I want to thank you all for the great job you did in getting that done.</p>, <p>But we have to stay vigilant, especially with the Delta variant that's out there. While COVID-19 cases are rising, virtually all of the COVID death—virtually all of the COVID deaths and hospitalizations are from unvaccinated people. Let me say it again: Virtually all are from unvaccinated people.</p>, <p>And that means the safest thing to do is to get vaccinated—get vaccinated. And that's why we're focusing, on our next phase, on getting the unvaccinated vaccinated. I know it seems like a constant uphill climb, but it's gradually—we're making progress, but we've got a way to go yet.</p>, <p>Secondly, the economy. Yesterday—that I spoke of the historic economic progress we've made, which starts with the American Rescue Plan: shots in arms that saved a lot of lives; checks and tax cuts to give them just a little extra breathing room, ordinary Americans; and lower health care costs, just when so many Americans needed that help. And it's helped create 3 million—3 million jobs—more than any administration has done in the first 6 months of being in office—again, thanks to all of you.</p>, <p>And with our bipartisan infrastructure framework and our Build Back Better plan, I think we can turn this—this great movement into a economic boom for some time to come. And I really mean that. I think we're in a cusp—not only getting us out of the hole, but setting us on a—on a path that's going to generate significant continued economic growth.</p>, <p>And the American people are overwhelmingly supportive of our plans—that's support that a lot of our friends on the other team kind of miss. The polling data shows that they strongly support—strongly support our efforts for infrastructure.</p>, <p>I think they're a little tired of ""infrastructure week"" for 4 years in a row. I think we're on the verge of me being able to get something really done—rebuilding roads and bridges; replacing lead water pipes; delivering high-speed internet to every American—rural and inner city; and taking on the climate crisis with—with American jobs.</p>, <p>And they want us to build back—to build back better. They don't know the name necessarily, but they know that they support universal pre-K and 2 years of community college; paid leave and childcare, which is essentially a significant tax cut for working class families; and allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug cost, which will significantly reduce drug prices across the board for people.</p>, <p>And they support asking the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans and corporate America not to pay more than they should; just begin to pay their fair share, just step up a little bit.</p>, <p>The idea that 50 of the largest corporations in America pay no tax, it's—I think people should be able to be millionaires and billionaires if they have the ideas, but, Lord's sake, the idea—let's start paying your fair share.</p>, <p>And third thing is, there are—and, by the way, there's overwhelming evidence in the polling data, they support what we're doing, is how to pay for these programs.</p>, <p>Thirdly, restoring American leadership in the world. I know you all have—those of you who've traveled around the world—I know our Ambassador to the United Nations knows it full well—that America has—was really behind the eight ball the last 4 years. We've lost a lot of our standing. I don't have to tell that to my buddy sitting on my right here, the Secretary of State. He understands it well.</p>, <p>And as I've said before, we are—we are defining—in a defining competition right now for the 21st century—for the second quarter of the 21st century—with China and many other nations. And many of these nations believe that autocracy is the future; that democracies cannot compete with autocracies, because it's so hard—things are moving so rapidly, technologically and otherwise, that democracies can't get the act together enough to get a consensus how to move.</p>, <p>Well, I reject that most—notion completely, and I think the vast majority of American people do as well.</p>, <p>You know, in my conversations and meetings with world leaders—just coming back from, I guess, what 8, 9 days over there, ending with a meeting with Putin—you know, I'm making it absolutely clear that democracy is more capable—more capable, and America is back, whether it's helping vaccinate the world. And we're not just vaccinating ourself—we'll get into it—we're going to vaccinate—help vaccinate the world.</p>, <p>We're building back better to create jobs and grow the middle class not just at home, everywhere. It's in our interests the economic—the economies of these other nations grow.</p>, <p>And we're going to lead the fight against the climate crisis and tackling—tackling the challenges of cybersecurity. We've been very clear to our—our—other nations as to what we expect in terms of their conduct.</p>, <p>And finally, there's much more to be done and so much more to do—tackling voting rights, which is an existential threat to democracy right now. The things that are being asked are just beyond the pale. And the Vice President has been working hard on this issue and is going to continue to—we all are—but there's much more to do. We have to tackle the immigration problem, which we're working really hard to get done in a humane and serious way. Police reform and crime.</p>, <p>And the bottom line is: We're delivering on our promises. We have to deliver on all the promises we made. Because I think we're in a situation where the vast majority of the public agrees with the essence of what we're trying to do.</p>, <p>And so I just think that we're showing there's nothing that America is unable to do when we do it together.</p>, <p>And so, you know, I think it's time for us to stop now so we can get started with our meeting. So are you ready, folks, to go to work?</p>, <p><i>Participants.</i> Yes.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, quickly: Do you think vaccinated people should start wearing masks?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>[<i>Inaudible</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Guys, we're going to work now. We're—we'll have plenty of time to—[<i>inaudible</i>].</p>]"
15,5,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Honoring the 2021 Super Bowl Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-honoring-the-2021-super-bowl-champion-tampa-bay-buccaneers,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Well, good morning, I think, still—good morning. And it's great to see everybody here. I want to thank the Representatives here. The Second Gentleman is here. Representative Castor, Crist——</p>, <p><i>Participant</i>. [<i>Inaudible</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Okay, you got—[<i>laughter</i>]. I'll tell you, that Florida thing is something else. Anyway. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>And Soto and Murphy and Franklin. And one of my best friends in the world—now he's coming back from outer space—Bill Nelson, who runs NASA now.</p>, <p>We're here today to congratulate and welcome to the White House the Super Bowl Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. To the players, the coaches, and the Glazer family—my good friends—it's an honor to have you here.</p>, <p>We have to say that the fans down in western Florida are having a pretty good year this year. I tell you, you know, the Stanley Cup and—in addition to the Super Bowl. But you know, we're making a pretty strong case to start calling Tampa the ""City of Champions.""</p>, <p>And—[<i>applause</i>]—the—this Buccaneer team is a testament of the fact that it's never too late to come together and achieve extraordinary things. Three quarters of the way through the season, they found themselves in the middle of the pack: seven wins and five losses.</p>, <p>But this is a team that didn't fold and always got up, dug deep. They won their last four games of the season and then stormed through the playoffs—winning on the road in Washington, New Orleans, and Green Bay—and capping it all off back home in Tampa to become the first team to win the Super Bowl on their home turf in a decisive victory against the defending champs, the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>, <p>You know, it's an incredible run by one of the most well-rounded teams in recent memory: a pair of All-Pro linebackers, star pass rushers, dangerous secondary, dominant offensive line. And a legendary tight end who gave up what, I'm told, was a promising career to return to—acting career—to return to the game.</p>, <p>And most importantly, you've got a star receiver from Delaware. I'm mildly prejudiced about that. [<i>Laughter</i>] Where's Chris? Where are you, Chris? There you go. Now, I called him before the game to tell him—to give him some tips on how to run some patterns. That was a—[l<i>aughter</i>].</p>, <p>But you know, born in Pennsylvania, raised in Delaware. Where I come from, that's a heck of a combination, man. You know, Chris and I had a chance to speak before the Super Bowl. And I know, like me, he takes a lot of pride in his home State of Delaware. Chris, you're inspiring a whole lot of kids back home in Delaware.</p>, <p>And he went to a—by the way, he went to a high school called Middletown—a perennial winner of the State championship. But I pointed out to him, when my son Hunter was a senior, he went to my alma mater's high school named—by the way, all sit down. What are we—standing? I'm sorry. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>I—you know, and I told him my son scored the scoring touchdown at Archmere, won the State championship that year. But, anyway, that's—we don't—we don't count those things. You know, I've never met an athlete that doesn't remember every damn play he made.</p>, <p>And, of course, two other guys worth mentioning: the coach and the quarterback. You know, a lot has been made about the fact that we have the oldest coach ever to win a Super Bowl and the oldest quarterback to win the Super Bowl.</p>, <p>Well, I'll tell you right now: You won't hear any jokes about that from me. As far as I'm concerned, there's nothing wrong with being the oldest guy to make it to the mountaintop. That's how I look at it.</p>, <p>And, Tom, looking at you—got about 20 more years left. You're just about the best ever to play. And making it to 10 Super Bowls in the last 20 years—that ain't bad, man. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'll tell you what, we've never seen anything like it in the game.</p>, <p>And, of course, these guys all know that sports are more than just a game. It's something—some of my strongest memories, most enduring memories and lessons and cherished friendships come from the days I played—now I wasn't anywhere near anybody on my stage. I started in grade school playing in CYO league.</p>, <p>And I'll never forget getting knocked out when I was in fifth grade, and my dad walking out there, he said: ""Get up. Get up. Get up. Unless something is broken, get up."" Well, I think that's what sports tell you: You just get up. You get up.</p>, <p>I went to the University of Delaware to play football, although it didn't very—do much for my career, I didn't do very well. But, you know, I found out that your career can be embellished a little over time. I—it's amazing kind of thing.</p>, <p>You know, there's an awards banquet that, many years later—which is called the Timmie Awards—was it?—and it was held here in Washington. Supreme Court Justices and Presidents would show up to this big banquet. And the University of Delaware football program received the award, and I had a chance to introduce a Hall of Fame coach, one of my—the backfield coach when I played. I didn't play much. His name was Tubby Raymond. And—and so, I got up, and I said, ""Here is my coach, Tubby Raymond."" Made—said some nice things about Tubby.</p>, <p>Tubby was really, kind of, nervous and—standing in front of Presidents and Supreme Court Justices and so many distinguished people. And he went up on—on to talk about what an incredible ball player I was at the University of Delaware. [<i>Laughter</i>] It was amazing. It was amazing. That's why I decided to run for President. I figured, if he was still around, I'd get to be elected President, I would've been an All-American. [<i>Laughter</i>] I could've been big. I could've been big.</p>, <p>But all kidding aside, you guys did it the hard way. And I hope you all know just how important it was for—after such a tough year for the Nation. In the middle of a long, dark winter, every Sunday, people were able to sit down and watch you play. You created memories that helped folks make it through and believe that we could get back to normal again. And you did it as a team, trailblazing, including the first team with two women full-time coaching positions.</p>, <p>And realizing that of the—of the 25 or 6 Glazer grandchildren, and about 24 of them being women—no, you had no choice. It's about time they stepped up. Right, guys?</p>, <p>Anyway, all kidding aside, the step—your team stepped off, off the field, too, donating millions of meals to families in need; helping Americans exercise their sacred right to vote, including at the Raymond James Stadium. Your stadium also became a lifeline for families in Tampa Bay this spring, administering nearly 200,000 vaccine shots. And you all who don't have a shot, man: Get one, okay?</p>, <p><i>Head Coach Bruce Arians.</i> Amen.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Get one, get one, get one.</p>, <p>And you're saving lives—helping us get back to our lives and our loved ones.</p>, <p>And I want to thank the NFL for setting strong vaccination goals so fans can go see a game without becoming a super-spreader event.</p>, <p>Getting vaccinated is about staying healthy and understanding that no one is invincible, even if you are young and you're fit. It's about looking out for those on the front line—workers out there, like the ones that the team played in front of in the Super—on Super Bowl Sunday.</p>, <p>Those workers remind us of a quintessential lesson about sports and America itself. That no matter how much and how many times we get knocked down, we always get up. We come back. We come back stronger together and achieve incredible things—just like your team did, just like we're doing as a country.</p>, <p>So, congratulations, and thank you all for being here. Good luck to you all this season. And now let me bring up Bryan to say a few words.</p>, <p><i>Co-owner and Cochairman Bryan Glazer.</i> Mr. President, on behalf of our family, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers coaches, players, and staff, and all of our loyal fans, thank you for hosting us today. It's an honor for us to be at the White House.</p>, <p>For our family and fans, this day has been nearly 20 years in the making. Because despite this being our second Super Bowl Championship, this is our first visit to the White House. In 2003, following our Super Bowl XXXVII victory, there were world events that prevented us to visit. So that makes today even more special.</p>, <p>And we're here today because this team did the impossible: new players, including a new quarterback; no offseason mini camps; no preseason; limitations on meetings; rules and regulations were changing every day. But they stayed focused and went on to win their final eight games, as the President spoke about, and became the first team to win the Super Bowl at home. Amazing.</p>, <p>It's only fitting that as we enter the 46th season in Tampa Bay Buccaneer history that we celebrate it with the 46th President of the United States.</p>, <p>We start this season with only one goal in mind: It's to come back here next summer and spend a Super Bowl victory again with you.</p>, <p><i>Quarterback Tom Brady. </i>Right.</p>, <p><i>Head Coach Bruce Arians.</i> Thank you, Mr. President, for giving us this day. It—I get emotional, but it's very, very special. This is actually my third time, and it never gets old.</p>, <p>And I want to thank our coaches, our players, our entire organization—men, women that did such a great job last year of coming together and banding together—not to beat the other team; we had to beat the virus first. And you sacrificed more than any team I've ever been around—players, coaches, your families—to make sure that we had our team on the field every Sunday.</p>, <p>And it's a great compliment to all of you. I can't say enough about our owners, the Glazer family. They're the best owners I've ever known and ever been around. Our players are outstanding. They do what they're supposed to do on and off the field, because they take care of each other.</p>, <p>We live by three words: trust, loyalty, and respect. We don't have any rules. If you have those, you'll have accountability, and you'll be able to do anything you want. One team, one cause.</p>, <p>I hope the Senate and the House start helping you. [<i>Applause</i>] One team, one cause.</p>, <p>All right. Again, thank you all for having us here. Thank you, Mr. President. And go Bucs. And Tom has got some stuff to say.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Brady.</i> All right. Thank you, Mr. President. It's certainly an honor to be here. Thank you very much for your hospitality your entire staff has given us today. I think what—behind me is an amazing group of players. We have a bunch of coaches and staff here sitting down.</p>, <p>And it was actually a very challenging season for a lot of reasons, but we bonded together, we worked really hard, we put all our individual agendas aside, and we came together as a team.</p>, <p>And sports has an amazing way of bringing people together. If you look at us, we're all a little bit different ages. I'm a little older than most of them. But we come from a lot of different places across the country, a lot of different schools, a lot of different backgrounds, but we love each other; we're committed to one another. And when you do that, amazing things happen.</p>, <p>And these guys are amazing group of men. It didn't look great there at one point. We were seven and five, struggling a little bit, as the President alluded to. But we found our rhythm. We got on a roll.</p>, <p>Not a lot of people, you know, think that we could have won. And, in fact, I think about 40 percent of the people still don't think we won.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I understand that. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Mr. Brady.</i> You understand that, Mr. President?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I understand that.</p>, <p><i>Mr. Brady.</i> Yes. And personally, you know, it's nice for me to be back here. We had a game in Chicago where I forgot what down it was. I lost track of one down in 21 years of playing, and they started calling me ""Sleepy Tom."" [<i>Laughter</i>] Why would they do that to me?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I don't know. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Mr. Brady.</i> So it's great to be—you know, we're on the eve of football season. We start, tomorrow, practice. And we're going to do everything we can to work to achieve another one of those Lombardi trophies.</p>, <p>It's a different group of men. It'll be a different challenge, but we're excited for it. We're excited for the opportunity to compete and work hard and show everyone what we're made of.</p>, <p>So we're not going to throw the Super Bowl trophy this time, Cam, but we're going to offer President Biden a special presentation from Mr. Glazer. And then we're going to challenge—11 of us—11 White House interns to game of football here on the lawn, and we intend to run it up on you guys, so—[<i>laughter</i>]—get ready to go. Thank you.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President was presented with a Buccaneers jersey.</i>]</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, thank you, man. Unusual number, huh? Forty-six. [<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>]"
15,6,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With King Abdullah II of Jordan,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-king-abdullah-ii-jordan-0,"[<p><i>President Biden.</i> Well, I'm—I want to welcome back to the White House a good, loyal, and decent friend, His Majesty. And we've been hanging out together for a long time. I met him back when he was in the situation his son is, when his father was alive and I was a young Senator. And it's good to have him back in the White House.</p>, <p>You know, I want to thank you, Your Majesty, for your enduring and strategic relationship with the United States. You've always been there, and we will always be there for Jordan.</p>, <p>And, in addition to that, we were talking—we had an opportunity to speak just a moment in the Diplomatic Room. And we talked about how our children and my children were—had to finish off their senior year in college on Zoom.</p>, <p>And we talked about the COVID crisis. We were able to be a little bit of help to Jordan, and we hope to be able to help some more and—in this pandemic.</p>, <p>And I also want to thank you for your vital leadership in the Middle East. You live in a tough neighborhood. And the fact is, I look forward to hearing from His Majesty about the pressing challenges that——</p>, <p>[<i>At this point</i>, <i>a cell phone could be heard ringing.</i>]</p>, <p>——that Jordan faces. And whoever's—is that a call for me on the phone? [<i>Laughter</i>] And we're going to continue to strengthen our bilateral cooperation.</p>, <p>The world is changing. And you always—they always kid me. I'm always quoting Irish poets. It says—there was a famous poem—""All changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born."" But a lot has changed and a lot of opportunity, but also a lot of difficulty we're going to have to work our way through.</p>, <p>So, welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome.</p>, <p><i>King Abdullah.</i> Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.</p>, <p>Mr. President, thank you, as always, for the kindness that you showed me. And as you alluded to, I had the honor and the privilege of knowing you with my father decades ago. And so this is very warming for me to be able to see you in this position and to thank you for the generosity you always have shown me and my country.</p>, <p>You alluded to supporting us with vaccines. So, on behalf of Jordan and the people of Jordan, thank you so much for the leadership you've shown not only in supporting our country, but fighting COVID internationally. You've set the standard for the rest of us to follow.</p>, <p>We come together as always strong partners. We have, as you said, many challenges in our part of the world. I think many of us leaders from our part of the world will do the heavy lifting, which is what we need to do, on behalf of the United States. But you can always count on me, my country, and many of our colleagues in the region. A lot to do, sir, but with your leadership, we will prevail.</p>, <p><i>President Biden.</i> Well, as my grandfather used to say: ""With the grace of God and the good will to the neighbors,"" we'll be able to get a lot done.</p>, <p>Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>]"
15,7,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the National Economy and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-economy-and-exchange-with-reporters-10,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good morning. Sorry to keep you waiting. I apologize. Well, good morning. Tomorrow marks exactly 6 months since my administration began. I think it's a fitting moment to take a look at our economy—where we were 6 months ago, what we've achieved since then, and what I believe we've—I believe where we're headed.</p>, <p>Before I took office, there was a lot of folks out there—a lot of folks out there making some pretty bold predictions about how things would turn out. You might remember some of the predictions. That if I became President, we'd, quote, ""see a depression the likes of which we've never seen."" End of quote.</p>, <p>Well, it's true that the economy was sputtering before I got here, adding only 60,000 jobs per month for the 3 months before I was sworn in. But now, 6 months later, we've changed that.</p>, <p>We've gone from 60,000 jobs per month to 60,000 jobs every 3 days, more than 600,000 jobs per month since I took office. More than 3 million new jobs all told. That's the fastest growth, I'm told, at this point in any administration's history.</p>, <p>Another prediction—that is my favorite one, I must add—is that if I got elected, I'd bring the end to capitalism. [<i>Laughter</i>] I never understood that one, but we've heard—we've heard it an awful lot. Well, in 6 months into my administration, the U.S. economy has experienced the highest economic growth rate in nearly 40 years.</p>, <p>And we know we've—and now we knew that we needed to launch a war-time effort to get the—America vaccinated and pass a powerful American Rescue Plan.</p>, <p>We did both those things. And now, the forecasters have doubled their projections for growth this year in the economy to 7 percent or higher. In fact, the U.S. is the only developed country in the world where growth projections today are stronger than they were before the pandemic hit.</p>, <p>At the same time, companies across the country are giving workers a raise. Unusual thing. [<i>Laughter</i>] And the number of new unemployment claims has been cut by more than half since I took office.</p>, <p>And by the way, 2 weeks ago, I issued a major Executive order promoting fair and open competition, which is the cornerstone—the cornerstone of American capitalism, banning noncompete clauses that suppress workers' wages; lowering the price of things like hearing aids, prescription drugs, internet service; along with dozens of other actions.</p>, <p>Folks, it turns out capitalism is alive and very well. We're making serious progress to ensure that it works the way it's supposed to work: for the good of the American people.</p>, <p>So, for all those predictions of doom and gloom, 6 months in, here's where we stand: record growth, record job creation, workers getting hard-earned breaks.</p>, <p>Look, we've brought this economy back from the brink. And we designed our strategy not only to provide for a temporary boost, but to lay the foundation for a long-term boom that brings everyone along.</p>, <p>You know, that's why we designed the American Rescue Plan to help not just all those—everyone at once, but over the course of a full year and beyond so we could help families and small businesses weather the ups and downs of our—as the economy recovers from an historic pandemic. And I—there are going to be ups and downs.</p>, <p>We saw a great example of that just last week. For the first time, monthly payments began going out to nearly every working family raising a child in the United States of America. Thanks to the expanded child tax credit in the American Rescue Plan: $300 a month going out for each child under the age of six, and $250 for every child 6 through 17, every month for the next 6 months, with more coming in the spring.</p>, <p>That money is a game changer. For some, it's a lifesaver. Think of the single mom, struggling to put food on the table each month. The parent who has to tell their kid, ""I'm sorry, honey, but we can't afford those dance classes or the sports team you want to play on this fall. We can't do it."" You know, they can't wait for the credit against their taxes to be coming next year as a tax credit. They need cash in their pockets today.</p>, <p>For families with the least, this money will do the most—dramatically reducing child poverty in America. And for millions of middle class families, it will give them a little bit of breathing room every month. That's just one example of how we're building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.</p>, <p>But despite that progress, we cannot afford to be complacent. We know that our economic recovery hinges on getting the pandemic under control.</p>, <p>You know, and by fully vaccinating 160 million Americans, 80 percent of our seniors, we've fundamentally changed the course of the pandemic—from one that threatens all Americans, to a disease that has the most severe impacts only on the unvaccinated people in the country. But we can't let up, especially since and because of the Delta variant, which is more transmissible—more transmissible and more dangerous.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, cases are now rising, particularly in communities with very low vaccination rates. Just four States account for nearly 40 percent—four States, 40 percent of all cases last week. Virtually all hospitalizations and deaths are occurring among unvaccinated Americans. These tragedies are avoidable.</p>, <p>The data couldn't be clearer: If we're—if you're fully vaccinated, you have a high degree of protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death. If you're unvaccinated, you are not protected. So, please, please get vaccinated. Get vaccinated now. It works. It's safe. It's free. It's convenient.</p>, <p>You know, this virus doesn't have to hold you back any longer. It doesn't have to hold our economy back any longer. But the only way we put it behind us is if more Americans get vaccinated.</p>, <p>We also know that as our economy has come roaring back, we've seen some price increases. Some folks have raised worries that this could be a sign of persistent inflation. But that's not our view. Our experts believe and the data shows that most of the price increases we've seen are—were expected and expected to be temporary.</p>, <p>The reality is, you can't flip the global economic light back on and not expect this to happen. As demand returns, there's going to be global supply chain challenges. We've seen that in semi-conductors, which are used in automobiles. That global shortage has slowed vehicle production, creating a temporary spike in car prices. That's a real challenge. And my administration is doing everything we can to address it. But again, these disruptions are temporary.</p>, <p>Lumber prices are another example. They spiked early in our recovery, but in recent weeks, they've began to fall—they've fallen by more than 50 percent.</p>, <p>In the hospitality industry, prices are returning to where they used to be. Economists call all of these things ""transitory effects."" And they account for about 60 percent of the price increases we've seen over the last few months.</p>, <p>Now, I want to be clear: My administration understands that if we were to ever experience unchecked inflation over the long term that would pose a real challenge to our economy. So while we're confident that isn't what we are seeing today, we're going to remain vigilant about any response that is needed.</p>, <p>As I made clear to Chairman Powell of the Federal Reserve when we met recently, the Fed is independent. It should take whatever steps it deems necessary to support a strong, durable economic recovery. But whatever different views some might have on current price increases, we should be united on one thing: passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework, which we shook hands on. We shook hands on it. And my Build Back Better plan will be a force for achieving lower prices for Americans looking ahead. It's another reason why these investments are so important.</p>, <p>If we make a prudent, multiyear investments in better roads, bridges, transit systems, and high-speed internet, and a modern, resilient electric grid, here's what will happen: It breaks up the bottlenecks in our economy. Goods get to consumers more rapidly and less expensively. Small businesses create and innovate much more seamlessly. If we increase the availability of quality, affordable childcare, eldercare, paid leave, more people will enter the workforce.</p>, <p>These steps will enhance our productivity—raising wages without raising prices. That won't increase inflation. It will take the pressure off of inflation, give a boost to our workforce, which leads to lower prices in the years ahead.</p>, <p>So, if your primary concern right now is inflation, you should be even more enthusiastic about this plan. And as we promote—as we promote fair competition in our economy through the Executive order I mentioned, it will drive down prices even further. New businesses will get in the game, competing against those giant corporations who have been free to ramp up prices because they haven't had any real competition.</p>, <p>Look, the bottom line is this: What the best companies do and what we as a country should do is make smart, sustainable investments with appropriate financing to make this Nation more productive, to advance America's leadership on clean energy to win the jobs of the future while meeting the threat of climate change, and to ensure that all working Americans benefit from the growth they're helping produce.</p>, <p>The independent experts who have analyzed my plans have found that they would do just that: expand output and enable millions of Americans to enter the labor workforce now, just this year—not just for the next—but not just this year, but for decades in the future. It's not temporary.</p>, <p>This is the best strategy to create millions of jobs and lift up the middle class families and grow wages and keep prices affordable for the long term.</p>, <p>What we can't do is go back to the same old trickle-down theories that gave us nearly $2 trillion in deficit-financed corporate tax giveaways that did nothing to make our economy more productive or resilient. The same people who cheered on that approach are now telling us it isn't [is]* a problem if big companies have actually to compete for workers and offer them a fair wage with some dignity.</p>, <p>I could not disagree more. We can't go back to the old, failed thinking. We need to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, as I've said before.</p>, <p>The investments I'm proposing are investments the American people want and investments that our country needs. And if we get this done, a wide range of independent forecasters project that it will have an incredibly significant impact on GDP and jobs—good-paying jobs with prevailing wages. And the majority of these jobs will go to people without a college degree.</p>, <p>I've said it before, and it's true: This is a blue-collar blueprint for building an American economy back. Simply put, we can't afford not to make these investments. And we're going to pay for them responsibly as well, by ensuring that our largest corporations and the very wealthiest among us pay their fair share by reforming our international tax system with a minimum global tax, which we've led the world to agree to.</p>, <p>Let me close with this: When I arrived in office, it had been a long time since the government had worked for the people. Things had been great for big corporations and folks at the top. Those 55 major corporations that paid zero in income tax while making billions in profits, they had no complaints.</p>, <p>But when I took office, I made a commitment—a commitment to the American people that we were going to change that paradigm so working families could have a fighting chance again to get a good education; to get a good job and a raise; to take care of the elderly parent or the child with the disability and still be able to go out and earn a good living; to stop losing hours of their lives stuck in traffic because the streets are crumbling; or waiting for slow, spotty internet to connect them to the world.</p>, <p>That's what the economy we're building is all about. That's why we passed the American Rescue Plan. And that's why we need the investment of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework and my Build Back Better plan.</p>, <p>Our economy has come a long way over the last 6 months. We can't slow down now. We can make this boom we're experiencing today one that will ensure that all Americans have an opportunity to share in it for years to come. And we can show the world that American democracy can deliver for the people.</p>, <p>I look forward to continuing to build this economy. And I'm incredibly optimistic about what we're going to be able to build together in the next 6 months and the years to come.</p>, <p>Thank you all for listening. May God bless you. And I'll take a few questions.</p>, <p><i>Facebook, Inc./Spread of Disinformation on Social Media </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, you said last week that companies and platforms like Facebook are ""killing people"" by letting them——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Let me—[<i>inaudible</i>]—precisely what I said. I'm glad you asked me that question. One, I had just read that—on the Facebook—Facebook pointed out that—it was pointed out that Facebook, of all the misinformation, 60 percent of that misinformation came from 12 individuals. That's what the article said.</p>, <p>So I was asked that question about what do I think is happening. Facebook isn't killing people; these 12 people who are out there giving misinformation—anyone listening to it is getting hurt by it. It's killing people. It's bad information.</p>, <p>My hope is that Facebook, instead of taking it personally—that somehow I'm saying Facebook is killing people—that they would do something about the misinformation—the outrageous—misinformation about the vaccine. That's what I meant.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Have they done enough in your opinion to stop the spread?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I haven't—to be completely honest with you, I don't know that they did anything today. Up to—over the weekend, I don't think they had. But I don't know. I don't know the answer to that question.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Will you hold them accountable if they don't do more to stop the spread?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'm—when you say ""hold accountable,"" I just want to—I'm not trying to hold people—I'm trying make people to look at themselves. Look in the mirror. Think about that misinformation going to your son, your daughter, your relatives, someone you love. That's what I'm asking.</p>, <p>All the way in the back.</p>, <p><i>Pathways to U.S. Citizenship/National Economy </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Yes, thank you, Mr. President. At what point would you consider inflation unchecked to a point at which you would either consider taking action or you would want to see the Fed take action?</p>, <p>And secondly, why do you believe that the budget bill is appropriate legislation for a pathway to citizenship?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, first of all, I think we need to find pathways to citizenship. The budget bill is an appropriate way to get around the filibuster to be able to make a judgment as to whether or not they should have a pathway. That's for the Parliamentarian to decide, not for Joe Biden to decide.</p>, <p>Your first part of the question was?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>It was on inflation. You mentioned unchecked inflation.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yeah. There's nobody suggesting there's unchecked inflation on the way—no serious economist. That's totally different.</p>, <p>I mean, look, the stock market is higher than it has been in all of history, even went down this month—even down this month.</p>, <p>Now, I don't look at the stock market as a means by which to judge the economy like my predecessor did. But he'd be very—he'd be talking to you every day for the last 5 months about how the stock market is so high—higher than any time in history, still higher than any time in history.</p>, <p>So, that's not how I judge whether or not we have economic growth.<i> </i></p>, <p><i>China/Cybersecurity Attacks/Russia </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, on China and cyber hacking——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> She jumps up before you do. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Effectively, your administration is naming and shaming China, but no sanctions. Why? And is that effective enough?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> They're still determining exactly what happened. The investigation is not finished.</p>, <p>Thank you all very much.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>On China real quick—on China real quick: What is your understanding of the biggest difference between what they've done versus what Russia has done in terms of cyber hacking?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That'd take a longer explanation.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>We have all the time in the world. What is it?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, we don't. I have to go see the King of Jordan.</p>, <p>Look, to the best of my knowledge—and I'm getting a report tomorrow morning on this, a detailed report—my understanding is that the Chinese Government, not unlike the Russian government, is not doing this themselves, but are protecting those who are doing it and maybe even accommodating them being able to do it. That may be the difference.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>, <p><i>2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Should the Olympics go forward, Mr. President?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> They are.</p>]"
15,8,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on Child Tax Credit Relief Payments,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-child-tax-credit-relief-payments,"[<p>Thank you. Thank you. Well, for you—anybody under the age of 13—this has got to be boring, boring, boring for you. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right? Well, I'll tell you what, we have to work something out here so that when this is over, your parents, your uncles, your aunts—whoever you're with—they owe you some ice cream or something for this. You know? [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Folks, it's a pleasure to be here. I'm going to take a sip here.</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President took a drink of water.</i>]</p>, <p>And this—I believe this is actually a historic day, a historic day in the sense that we continue to build an economy that respects and recognizes the dignity of working class families and middle class families. It's historic, and it's our effort to make another giant step toward ending child poverty in America. I think this will be one of the things that the Vice President and I will be most proud of when our terms are up.</p>, <p>Beginning this morning, nearly all working families—that is people making under $150,000 as families or an individual making under $120,000—$25,000—who have children, are raising children in America, they're going to receive their first monthly tax cut payment. That payment from the expanded child tax credit that we signed into law as part of my—our American Rescue Plan.</p>, <p>It's one of the largest ever single tax cuts for families with children, and it's a reflection of our belief that the people of this country who need a tax cut aren't the folks at the top. They've got plenty of tax cuts. They're doing just fine. But it's the people in the middle, the folks who are struggling, who are just looking for a little bit of, my dad would say, ""a little bit of breathing room."" A little bit of breathing room.</p>, <p>And this has the potential to reduce child poverty in the same way that the Social Security reduced poverty for the elderly. And by the way, you think of monthly payments—you get a Social Security check—those who you know get Social Security, they get it monthly. Well, this will be—unless you want it in one lump sum, this would be a monthly payment for childcare—for—excuse me, for your children, a tax cut.</p>, <p>And here's how the tax credit works: For every child under the age of 6, a parent will get $3,600 a year. For every child 6 to 17, they'll get $3,000 per year. For example, a middle class family with two young children would expect to receive $7,200 a year to help raise their children. This will be the—they'll get the first half of this $3,600 starting today. Today. Today. And it will be paid out at $600 a month between now, July, and December. And then, they're going to get the rest of the payment next spring around tax day.</p>, <p>Now, if you file taxes electronically, you can go to your bank account today—today—and you'll see a child—a payment that says ""Child CTC."" Let me say that again: payments of $300 for each child under the age of 6, $250 for each child between the ages of 6 and 17 on a monthly basis between now—between July and December.</p>, <p>If you don't file electronically—your taxes electronically, as you did last year, you can expect to receive a check in the mail beginning today or a few days from now. And you'll get this payment on the 15th of every month for the rest of this year.</p>, <p>And if you're not required to file taxes at all in the past—you haven't filed because you didn't owe any taxes—then you can go to: childtaxcredit.gov. Let me say it again: childtaxcredit.gov. And you will give you—they'll give you clear information and a link to help you sign up for the first time. This can be lifechanging for so many families.</p>, <p>Because of the way the tax credit was structured before the American Rescue Plan, more than 26 million children from the hardest pressed working families didn't get any full payment for the child credit—for childcare—for child tax credit. Half of all Black and Hispanic children in America never received the full tax credit. We've changed all that.</p>, <p>In technical terms, we've made this tax cut fully refundable. In plain English, it means instead of families who need help the most getting the least, the hard-working—the hard-working families—will get this on a monthly—full monthly basis. Ninety-seven percent of the children receiving this credit come from working families. And the other 3 percent includes kids being raised by retired grandparents or by someone with a serious disability.</p>, <p>And by the way, this credit doesn't start to phase out until a couple is making $150,000 or a single parent is making $112,000 [$112,500].* It begins to phase out then. This is a middle class tax cut. When I came up—when I decided I wanted this in the legislation, I referred to it in the way it really is: It's a middle class tax cut. It's just like the wealthy get tax cuts for a lot of things, this is a tax cut for your children—having children.</p>, <p>And this can make it possible for a hard-working parent to say to his or her child: ""Honey, we get—you can get your new braces now. We can get you a tutor to help you in that math class you're having trouble with. We can get you the sports equipment you need to sign up to—for your first team you're going to play on."" People have written me to tell me they'll use the money to buy their kids new shoes, to send them to summer camp, to cover afterschool care when school starts up again.</p>, <p>You know—and to give you a sense of how transformative this is: This would be the largest ever 1-year decrease in child poverty in the history of the United States of America—as we begin now. Historic reductions in child poverty among white, Black, and Latinos, and AAPI communities. It's not even close. The benefits will be felt for years.</p>, <p>Studies have shown——</p>, <p>[<i>A baby in the audience cried out.</i>]</p>, <p>——that tax relief that helps children—that's okay, don't worry about it. It's okay to let him cry, or her, whichever—that helps children and can lead to better health, better school performance, and better future earnings.</p>, <p>In fact, research from Columbia University in New York found that for each dollar this tax cut costs, it returns $8 in benefit down the line. Eight dollars would have to be spent other ways. It's a gigantic help. It's an 8-to-1 return. Your head, your heart, and your budget all lead to the same place. This is the right thing to do, and it's the smart thing to do.</p>, <p>Today these tax cut payments are arriving automatically. But it didn't happen automatically—the result of the work that people who did this, advocating for this for a long, long time. And we finally got it passed in my American Rescue Plan. I want to particularly thank those who have been fighting for this for years: Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro from Connecticut. She has been a champion for this issue. Congressman Richie Neal and Torres. And Senators Bennet, Brown, and Booker. And Ron Wyden.</p>, <p>You'll probably hear from our Republican friends—all who voted against this—but they'll tout the success as it helps working families in their States and their districts. But in the coming days, we're also going to hear from them saying, ""I want to now extend this tax""—it's only for 1 year now. It's all I could get it for, for the first time. And so I want to extend it into the future now. I have another piece of legislation that will be voted on soon, saying we're going to continue this.</p>, <p>To the people who say we can't afford to give the middle class a break, I say: We can afford it, by making people at the top and the big corporations—over 50 of which paid no taxes last year at all—to finally just start paying their fair share. I'm not going to gouge them. Just pay their fair share. Because people who are working hard and paying taxes deserve a break.</p>, <p>That's why—excuse me for all these terms I'm using, but my Build Back Better agenda, which still needs to be voted on in the Congress, keeps this tax cut for working families in place for years to come. We shouldn't let taxes go up on working families. We shouldn't let child poverty continue to stain the conscience or drag down our economy. And so I say to my colleagues in Congress: This tax cut for working families is something we should extend, not end, next year.</p>, <p>And I say to all of you watching: Make sure your family, friends, and community know about this tax cut. Send to them, as I said, childtaxcredit.gov to learn more about the difference this is going to make in their lives.</p>, <p>Let me close with this: I signed the American Rescue Plan less than 2 months after taking office on January 20. Four months later, we've implemented the first-ever automatic monthly payment for any major tax credit ever, as the Vice President was talking about, beyond Social Security, which was a long time ago.</p>, <p>This groundbreaking effort is similar to what we did in our—what I called our ""wartime effort"" to vaccinate Americans against COVID-19, to mobilize the whole country. We're proving that democracy can deliver for people, and deliver in a timely way: saving lives, improving lives, helping fuel a record-setting recovery, giving working families a fighting chance again.</p>, <p>I received an e-mail today from a mother in Washington State. She's a young teacher who had just received her payment. She wrote, and I'm quoting: ""My family has been living hand to mouth to put me through school so I can follow my passion of molding young minds . . . . This first CTC payment has come at the exact moment when we need it most. These payments may seem small to some, but they are lifechanging for my family, for us.""</p>, <p>Millions of children and their families, starting today, their lives are about to change for the better. And our country will be better off for it as well. This is a really good day. And parents are going to be able to tell your kids when they're 25-years-old that you were there the day this happened; we talked about it. We are showing once again that there's nothing beyond the capacity—our capacity as Americans to get done when we do it together.</p>, <p>So I want to thank you. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. And kids, thank you for being so polite while I was speaking. [<i>Laughter</i>] You're very, very nice. Thank you, thank you, thank you. See you all. Bye-bye.</p>]"
15,9,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Governors and Mayors on Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-governors-and-mayors-infrastructure-and-jobs-legislation-and,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Well, we're going to talk about infrastructure and how we're going to have to widen this room so you all can get in. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>I want to thank you for being here, all of you, to discuss an issue that has been always bipartisan for the longest time. When I got here 180 years ago—[<i>laughter</i>]—it was a bipartisan issue.</p>, <p>Mayors and Governors, more than anyone else, knows what it means to be accountable to people, and you have to solve problems every single day in your communities. And there's no—there are no Democratic roads or Republican bridges.</p>, <p>And—but you know, but there are families in need of shorter commute times, safer commutes; kids need to be able to drink clean drinking water that doesn't have lead in it; and communities need to have reliable transit systems.</p>, <p>And we have a chance to solve these problems, a bipartisan chance to solve these problems. It would create millions of jobs, literally, not $7-an-hour jobs or even $15-an-hour jobs, but jobs of prevailing wages, making $46, $50 an hour with benefits, and you know—and a chance for America to put ourselves in a position where we can begin to win the second quarter of the 21st century, because our infrastructure, relative to the rest of the world, is moving—we're falling behind.</p>, <p>I found it disturbing to find out that they ask if you name—I think it was the 25 best airports in the world——</p>, <p><i>National Economic Council Director Brian C. Deese.</i> Yes, sir.</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>——the United States wasn't mentioned. There wasn't a single U.S. entry.</p>, <p>So—but fixing the broken today is okay, but we've got to build for tomorrow. There's a lot we're going to do. And press is tired of hearing me say this because I've been talking about infrastructure for a while now. Hopefully, it won't be like the last team in here, once a week and not get anything done. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But we're going to get something done. And that's why I think that my Build Back Better agenda is all about not just building back, but build back better than what we inherited.</p>, <p>And mayors and Governors, you know how to get this done. And what we have to do, it's time to stop talking about it and time to get you the resources. But what I want to talk about today is what you need most and what you think will work the best.</p>, <p>And so that's what we're going to be talking about, and hopefully, we're going to get a lot done.</p>, <p>So thank you all for coming in.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Do you need to do more work on the pay-fors, Mr. President? Are the pay-fors even intact?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> He's talking about—I went up and spoke to the Democratic Caucus today, and we put together a plan that dealt with infrastructure. And it's a bipartisan plan. I think we're in good shape. There may be some slight adjustments to the—of the pay-fors. And that's going to get down to what the Congress wants to do.</p>, <p>I've laid out how I think we'd pay for it. And we have an agreement. We have an agreement. There may be slight changes; I'm not sure what may happen, exactly how—but it's going to be paid for. And that's what we're going to do.</p>, <p>So thank you all very much.</p>, <p><i>Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation/Bipartisanship </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, any concern that having two tracks here will disrupt the bipartisan agreement that was worked out?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I think it's the only way to get it done is having those two tracks.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Thank you, sir.</p>]"
16,0,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks on Voting Rights in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-voting-rights-philadelphia-pennsylvania,"[<p>Thank you. I see an awful lot of good friends out there. Please have a seat if you have one.</p>, <p>I—let me begin by saying I used to be important. [<i>Laughter</i>] I used to be the chairman of the board of this place. And Jeffrey Rosen allowed me to do that for a while.</p>, <p>But thank you all for being here. I truly appreciate it. Governor, it's above and beyond the call. Mr. Mayor, I compliment—I thought you were a great mayor—still think you are—but your judgment in fiancées is even stronger. And—but all of you. And a good friend, Bobby Brady. I see so many friends out. Al Sharpton—Al, how are you, pal? It's great to see you.</p>, <p>And I'm going to get in trouble here because I'm going to recognize my Congresswoman from the State of Delaware, Lisa Blunt Rochester, and her sister who used to run my office. Stand up.</p>, <p>Well, folks, good afternoon. There's a serious subject I'd like to talk about today. I'm here in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center, the city and the place where the story of ""We the People""—""We the People""—began. It's a story that's neither simple nor straightforward. That's because the story is the sum of our parts, and all those parts are fundamentally human. And being human is to be imperfect, driven by appetite and ambition as much as by goodness and grace.</p>, <p>But some things in America should be simple and straightforward. Perhaps the most important of those things—the most fundamental of those things—is the right to vote. The right to vote freely. The right to vote freely, the right to vote fairly, the right to have your vote counted. The democratic threshold is liberty. With it, anything is possible. Without it, nothing—nothing.</p>, <p>And for our democracy and the work—and to deliver our work and [for]* our people, it's up to all of us to protect that right. This is a test of our time and what I'm here to talk about today.</p>, <p>Just think about the past election. A 102-year-old woman in Arkansas who voted for the first time on the very spot she once picked cotton. A 94-year-old woman in Michigan who voted early and in person in her 72d consecutive election. You know what she said? She said this election was, quote, ""the most important vote that we ever had.""</p>, <p>The daughter who voted in memory of her dad who died of COVID-19 so others wouldn't have the experience of pain and darkness and loss that she was going through. Patients out there. And the parents—the parents who voted for school their children will learn in. Sons and daughters voted for the planet they're going to live on. Young people just turning 18 and everyone who, for the first time in their lives, thought they could truly make a difference.</p>, <p>America—America and Americans of every background voted. They voted for good jobs and higher wages. They voted for racial equity and justice. They voted to make health care a right and not a privilege.</p>, <p>And the reason that Americans went to vote and the lengths they went to vote—to be able to vote in this past election were absolutely extraordinary. In fact, the fact that so many election officials across the country made it easier and safer for them to be able to vote in the middle of a pandemic was remarkable.</p>, <p>As a result, in 2020, more people voted in America than ever, ever in the history of America, in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. All told, more than 150 [million]* Americans of every age, of every race, of every background exercised their right to vote. They voted early. They voted absentee. They voted in person. They voted by mail. They voted by drop box. And then, they got their families and friends to go out and vote.</p>, <p>Election officials, the entire electoral system, withstood unrelenting political attacks, physical threats, intimidation, and pressure. They did so with unyielding courage and faith in our democracy.</p>, <p>With recount after recount after recount, court case after court case, the 2020 election was the most scrutinized election ever in American history. Challenge after challenge brought to local, State, and election officials; State legislatures; State and Federal courts—even to the United States Supreme Court not once, but twice.</p>, <p>More than 80 judges, including those appointed by my predecessor, heard the arguments. In every case, neither cause nor evidence was found to undermine the national achievement of administering this historic election in the face of such extraordinary challenges.</p>, <p>Audits, recounts were conducted in Arizona, in Wisconsin. In Georgia, it was recounted three times. It's clear. For those who challenge the results and question the integrity of the election: No other election has ever been held under such scrutiny and such high standards. The big lie is just that: a big lie.</p>, <p>The 2020 election—it's not hyperbole to suggest—the most examined and the fullest expression of the will of the people in the history of this Nation. This should be celebrated, the example of America at its best. But instead, we continue to see an example of human nature at its worst, something darker and more sinister.</p>, <p>In America, if you lose, you accept the results. You follow the Constitution. You try again. You don't call facts ""fake"" and then try to bring down the American experiment just because you're unhappy. That's not statesmanship. [<i>Applause</i>] That's not statesmanship, that's selfishness. That's not democracy, it's the denial of the right to vote. It suppresses. It subjugates.</p>, <p>The denial of full and free and fair elections is the most un-American thing that any of us can imagine, the most undemocratic, the most unpatriotic, and yet, sadly, not unprecedented.</p>, <p>From denying enslaved people—full citizenship until the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments after the Civil War; to denying women the right to vote until the 19th Amendment a hundred years ago; to poll taxes and literacy tests, and the Ku Klux Klan campaigns of violence and terror that lasted into the fifties and sixties; to the Supreme Court decision in 2013 and then again just 2 weeks ago, a decision that weakened the landmark Voting Rights Act; to the willful attacks—election attacks in 2020; and then to a whole other level of threat, the violence and the deadly insurrection on the Capitol on January 6.</p>, <p>I just got back from Europe, speaking to the G-7 and to NATO. They wonder—not a joke; they wonder, Gov—they ask me, ""Is it going to be okay?"" The citadel of democracy in the world, ""Is it going to be okay?"" Time and again, we've weathered threats to the right to vote in free and fair elections. And each time, we found a way to overcome. And that's what we must do today.</p>, <p>Vice President Harris and I have spent our careers doing this work. And I've asked her to lead, to bring people together to protect the right to vote and our democracy. And it starts with continuing the fight to pass H.R. 1, the For the People Act.</p>, <p>That bill—that bill—would help end voter suppression in the States, get dark money out of politics, give voice to the people at the grassroots level, create a fairer district maps, and end partisan political gerrymandering. Last month, Republicans opposed even debating, even considering For the Peoples Act. Senate Democrats stood united to protect our democracy and the sanctity of the vote. We must pass the For the People Act. It's a national imperative.</p>, <p>We must also fight for the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore and expand voting protections and prevent voter suppression. All the Congress women and men here—there's a bunch of you—you knew John, many of you.</p>, <p>Just weeks ago, the Supreme Court yet again weakened the Voting Rights Act and upheld what Justice Kagan called, quote, ""a significant race-based disparity in voting opportunities."" The Court's decision, as harmful as it is, does not limit the—Congress ability to repair the damage done. That's the important point. It puts the burden back on Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act to its intended strength.</p>, <p>As soon as Congress passes the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, I will sign it and let the whole world see it. That will be an important moment. And the world is wondering—the world is wondering—and Dwight knows what I'm talking about, for real. You know, the world is wondering, ""What is America going to do?""</p>, <p>But we also have to clear eyed about the obstruction we face. Legislation is one tool, but not the only tool. And it's not the only measure of our obligation to defend democracy today. For example, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the United States Department of Justice is going to be using its authorities to challenge the onslaught of State laws undermining voting rights in old and new ways.</p>, <p>The focus will be on dismantling racially discriminatory laws, like the recent challenge to Georgia's vicious antivoting law. The Department of Justice will do so with a voting rights division that—at my request—is doubling its size in enforcement staff. Civil rights groups—civil rights groups—and other organizations have announced their plans to stay vigilant and challenge these odious laws in the courts.</p>, <p>In Texas, for example, Republican-led State legislature wants to allow partisan poll watchers to intimidate voters and imperil—and impartial poll workers. They want voters to dive [drive]* further and be able to be in a position where they wonder who's watching them and intimidating them; to wait longer to vote. To drive a hell of lot—excuse me, a long way—[<i>laughter</i>]—to get to vote. They want to make it so hard and inconvenient that they hope people don't vote at all. That's what this is about.</p>, <p>This year alone, 17 States have enacted—not just proposed, but enacted—28 new laws to make it harder for Americans to vote, not to mention—and catch this—nearly 400 additional bills Republican members of the State legislatures are trying to pass. The 21st-century Jim Crow assault is real. It's unrelenting, and we're going to challenge it vigorously.</p>, <p>While this broad assault against voting rights is not unprecedented, it's taking on a new and, literally, pernicious forms. It's no longer just about who gets to vote or making it easier for eligible voters to vote. It's about who gets to count the vote, who gets to count whether or not your vote counted at all. It's about moving from independent election administrators who work for the people to polarized State legislatures and partisan actors who work for political parties.</p>, <p>To me, this is simple: This is election subversion. It's the most dangerous threat to voting and the integrity of free and fair elections in our history. Never before have they decided who gets to count—count—what votes count.</p>, <p>Some State legislatures want to make it harder for you to vote. And if you vote, they want to be able to tell you your vote doesn't count for any reason they make up. They want the ability to reject the final count and ignore the will of the people if their preferred candidate loses. And they're trying—not only targeting people of color, they're targeting voters of all races and backgrounds. It's with a simple target: who did not vote for them. That's the target.</p>, <p>It's unconscionable. I mean, really, I—it's hard to declare just how critical this is. It's simply unconscionable. We've got to shore up our election system and address the threats of election subversion, not just from abroad—which I spent time with Putin talking about—but from home. From home.</p>, <p>We must ask those who represent us at the Federal, State, and local levels: Will you deny the will of the people? Will you ignore their voices? We have to ask: Are you on the side of truth or lies; fact or fiction; justice or injustice; democracy or autocracy? That's what it's coming down to.</p>, <p>Which brings me to perhaps the most important thing we have to do: We have to forge a coalition of Americans of every background and political party—the advocates, the students, the faith leaders, the labor leaders, the business executives—and raise the urgency of this moment.</p>, <p>Because as much as people know they're screwing around with the election process, I don't think that most people think this is about who gets to count what vote counts—literally, not figuratively. You vote for certain electors to vote for somebody for President. State legislator comes along—under their proposal—and they say: ""No, we don't like those electors. We're going to appoint other electors who are going to vote for the other guy or other woman.""</p>, <p>Because here's the deal: In 2020, democracy was put to a test—first by the pandemic; then by a desperate attempt to deny the reality and the results of the election; and then by a violent and deadly insurrection on the Capitol, the citadel of our democracy.</p>, <p>I've been around a long time in public life. I thought I've seen it all or most of it all. But I never thought I'd see that, for real. And in spite of what you see on television—and you saw it—you have Senators saying it was just a day at the Capitol, just people visiting the Capitol.</p>, <p>Folks, but we met the test. Because of the extraordinary courage of election officials—many of them Republicans—our court system, and those brave Capitol police officers, because of them, democracy held. Look how close it came. I mean, for real, how close it came. We're going to face another test in 2022: a new wave of unprecedented voter suppression and raw and sustained election subversion. We have to prepare now.</p>, <p>As I've said time and again: No matter what, you can never stop the American people from voting. They will decide, and the power must always be with the people.</p>, <p>That's why, just like we did in 2020, we have to prepare for 2022. We'll engage in an all-out effort to educate voters about the changing laws, register them to vote, and then get the vote out. We'll encourage people to run for office themselves at every level.</p>, <p>We will be asking my Republican friends—in Congress, in States, in cities, in counties—to stand up, for God's sake, and help prevent this concerted effort to undermine our elections and the sacred right to vote. Have you no shame?</p>, <p>Whether it's stopping foreign interference in our elections or the spread of disinformation from within, we have to work together. Vice President Harris and I will be making it clear that there's real peril in making raw power, rather than the idea of liberty, the centerpiece of the common life.</p>, <p>The Founders understood this. The women of Seneca Falls understood this. The brave, heroic foot soldiers of the civil rights movement understood this. So must we.</p>, <p>This isn't about Democrats and Republicans; it's literally about who we are as Americans. It's that basic. It's about the kind of country we want today, the kind of country we want for our children and grandchildren tomorrow. And quite frankly, the whole world is watching.</p>, <p>Folks, I'm not being sentimental. I'm not preaching to you. I'm just giving it to you straight, as I promised I would always do: lay things out on the line and honor your trust with trust [truth].* So hear me clearly: There is an unfolding assault taking place in America today, an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote in fair and free elections, an assault on democracy, an assault on liberty, an assault on who we are—who we are as Americans.</p>, <p>For make no mistake, bullies and merchants of fear and peddlers of lies are threatening the very foundation of our country. It gives me no pleasure to say this. I never thought in my entire career I'd ever have to say it. But I swore an oath to you, to God: to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. And that's an oath that forms a sacred trust to defend America against all threats both foreign and domestic.</p>, <p>The assault on free and fair elections is just such a threat, literally. I've said it before: We're facing the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War—that's not hyperbole—since the Civil War. The Confederates back then never breached the Capitol as insurrectionists did on January the 6th. I'm not saying this to alarm you; I'm saying this because you should be alarmed.</p>, <p>I'm also saying this: There's good news. It doesn't have to be this way. It doesn't have to be, for real. We have the means. We just need the will: the will to save and strengthen our democracy. We did in twenty—we did it in the 2020. The battle for the soul of America—in that battle, the people voted. Democracy prevailed. Our Constitution held. We have to do it again.</p>, <p>My fellow Americans, it requires fair-mindedness; devotion to justice; corny as it sounds, a love of country. It requires us to unite in common purpose, to declare here and now: We, the people, will never give up. We will not give in. We will overcome. We will do it together. And guaranteeing the right to vote, ensuring every vote is counted has always been the most patriotic thing we can do.</p>, <p>Just remember, our late friend John Lewis said, ""Freedom is not a state; it's an act."" Freedom is not a state; it's an act. And we must act, and we will act. For our cause is just, our vision is clear, and our hearts are full. For ""We the People,"" for our democracy, for America itself, we must act.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and may God protect our troops and all those stand watch over our democracy. But act. We've got to act. Thank you.</p>]"
16,1,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks Prior a Meeting on Gun Crime Prevention Strategy and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-gun-crime-prevention-strategy-and-exchange-with-reporters,"[<p><i>Democratic Protests in Cuba </i></p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Folks, I want to start by recognizing the remarkable protests that are taking place in Cuba, with the Cuban people demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime. And I don't think we've seen anything like this protest in a long, long time, if, quite frankly, ever.</p>, <p>The United States stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights. And we call on the Government of Cuba to refrain from violence or attempts to silence the voice of the people of Cuba.</p>, <p><i>Assassination of President Jovenel Moïse of Haiti </i></p>, <p>And we're also closely following the developments in Haiti in the wake of the horrific assassination of the President that recently took place. The people of Haiti deserve peace and security, and Haiti's political leaders need to come together for the good of their country.</p>, <p>Over the weekend, I dispatched a high-level, expert delegation to assess the situation and to determine where the United States can offer our support.</p>, <p>And finally, as a close neighbor and friend of the people of both Cuba and Haiti, the United States stands ready to continue to provide assistance, and I'll have more for you as we move on.</p>, <p><i>Gun Crime Prevention Strategy </i></p>, <p>But the purpose of the meeting today is, we've convened a group of law enforcement and other community leaders, including mayors of the—of our cities: one, to thank them for their service because we owe them big time; second, to hear directly from each of them about reducing violent crime and, particularly, gun violence in their communities.</p>, <p>Last month, I met with a similar group to unveil my comprehensive strategy to do just that. And it's been an—you know, I guess—I look at the Attorney General—we've been this a long—at this a long time. A long time. It seems like most of my career I've been dealing with this issue.</p>, <p>While there's no one-size-fit-all approach, we know there are some things that work, and the first of those that work is stemming the flow of firearms used to commit violent crimes. And we've talked—you and I have talked about this, Mayor, before.</p>, <p><i>Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington, DC.</i> Absolutely.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> And it includes cracking down on holding rogue gun dealers accountable for violating the Federal law. It includes the Justice Department creating five new strike forces to crack down on illegal gun trafficking in the corridors supplying weapons of—to cities of New York—from New York to the Bay Area.</p>, <p>Secondly, it's supporting local law enforcement with Federal support they need. Our strategy provides including funding for law enforcement through the American Rescue Plan for States, cities, and to be able to hire police and pay them overtime in order to advance community policing.</p>, <p>Third, our plan invests in community violence and intervention. We—what we want to do is, when we—we know we utilize trusted community members and encourage more community policing, we can intervene before the violence erupts, at least that's what, I think, consensus and our experience. And community violence intervention programs have shown to reduce crime in some cities by up to 60 percent.</p>, <p>Fourthly, our strategy to fund the other vital services, like mental health and substance abuse disorder programs, job training, and summer job programs. And this is going to help prevent crime and support young people to pick up a paycheck instead of a pistol.</p>, <p>And fifth, our strategy helps formerly incarcerated people successfully reenter society with housing, jobs, and training, and other support that, up to now, have been denied to them. Somebody gets out of jail right now, after serving their time, they get a bus ticket and 25 bucks, and they end up under the same bridge they left. And we know this will help.</p>, <p>This will make us all safer. The American Rescue Plan funds programs to help get job training, apprenticeships, and work experience so they can gain stability and security and a chance for a better life.</p>, <p>And there's a lot more to my strategy, but at—that's at the core. It's about coordinating at a Federal, State, and local level. That's what, ultimately, we're going to talk about today.</p>, <p>We recognize that we have to come together to fulfill the first responsibility of a democracy, and that's keep each other safe. And that's what the American people are looking for when it comes to reducing violent crime and gun violence.</p>, <p>And I think this group is illustrative of what we need to get put together, and I want to thank them for being here. And I'm going to look forward to hearing from them because I'm going to be asking them what they think we should be doing on the Federal level.</p>, <p>So thank you very much. And we'll have more to say as we move on. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, will you be ready—Mr. President, will you be ready to——</p>, <p><i>Cuba/Haiti </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, would you consider changing the embargo on Cuba? Would you consider making any changes to the embargo on Cuba?<i> </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>When you will be ready to change Trump's reversal on Cuba, Mr. President?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> We are going to have more to say about Cuba and Haiti as the week goes on and—so stay tuned. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Does that change the situation on the ground?</p>]"

16,3,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on Signing an Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-executive-order-promoting-competition-the-american-economy-and-exchange,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Hello, everyone. Maybe we could have a Cabinet meeting. [<i>Laughter</i>] Please, please be seated. Thank you.</p>, <p>Well, it is not ""good morning,"" which my remarks say here, but—[<i>laughter</i>]—good afternoon. We're in the midst of a historic economic recovery. And because our successful vaccination program strategy has been working and the immediate relief through the American Rescue Plan has brought back our economy from the worst economic crisis in nearly a century, America is now on track. We're now on track for the highest economic growth in 40 years and among the highest growth records on record.</p>, <p>We designed our economic strategy to be durable through the ups and downs that come with recovery. And there are ups and downs.</p>, <p>That's why the American Rescue Plan was designed to help people not just all at once, but over the course of a full year so we could continue supporting families, small businesses, State and local budgets to help them weather those ups and downs.</p>, <p>And now that the economy is back on track, we're making progress on the second phase of our strategy: ensuring long-term growth. That's what my Build Back Better agenda, including my Americans' Family Plan and the bipartisan infrastructure agreement we reached last month—that's what they're all about: long term.</p>, <p>But to keep our country moving, we have to take another step as well—and I know you're all tired of hearing me during the campaign and since I'm elected President talk about it—and that's bringing fair competition back to the economy. That's why today I'm going to be signing shortly an Executive order promoting competition to lower price—to lower prices, to increase wages, and to take another critical step toward an economy that works for everybody.</p>, <p>The heart of American capitalism is a simple idea: open and fair competition. That means that if your companies want to win your business, they have to go out, and they have to up their game: better prices and services, new ideas and products. That competition keeps the economy moving and keeps it growing. Fair competition is why capitalism has been the world's greatest force for prosperity and growth.</p>, <p>By the same token, ""competitive economy"" means companies must do all they do to do—everything they do to compete for workers: offering higher wages, more flexible hours, better benefits. But what we've seen over the past few decades is less competition and more concentration that holds our economy back. We see it in Big Agriculture, in Big Tech, in Big Pharma. The list goes on.</p>, <p>Rather than competing for consumers, they are consuming their competitors. Rather than competing for workers, they're finding ways to gain the upper hand on labor. And too often, the Government has actually made it harder for new companies to break in and compete.</p>, <p>Look at what that means for family budgets. Take prescription drugs: Just a handful of companies control the market for many vital medicines, giving them leverage over everyone else to charge whatever they want. As a result, Americans pay two and a half times more for prescription drugs than in any other leading country. And nearly one in four Americans struggles to afford their medication.</p>, <p>Another example: hearing aids. Right now, if you need a hearing aid, you can't just walk into a pharmacy and pick one up over the counter. You have to get it from a doctor or a specialist. Not only does that make getting hearing aids inconvenient, it makes them considerably more expensive, and it makes it harder for new companies to compete, innovate, and sell hearing aids at lower prices. As a result, a pair of hearing aids can cost thousands of dollars. That's a big reason why just one in seven Americans with hearing loss actually use a hearing aid.</p>, <p>Another example: internet services. There are more than 65 million Americans who live in a place with only one high-speed internet provider. Research shows, when you have unlimited internet operation, you pay up to five times more on average than families in places with more choices. That's what a lack of competition does: It raises the prices you pay.</p>, <p>And it's not just consumers getting hurt. Big Ag is putting a squeeze on farmers. Small and family farms, first-time farmers—like veterans coming home and Black and Latino and indigenous farmers—they're seeing price hikes for seed, lopsided contracts, shrinking profits, and growing debt.</p>, <p>Lack of competition hurts workers as well. In many communities, there are only a handful of employers left competing for workers. Think of company towns across Appalachia and other parts of the country where one big corporation runs the show.</p>, <p>When corporations have that kind of leverage over workers, it pushes down average—it pushes down advertised wages by up to 17 percent. And as competition decreases, businesses don't feel the pressure to innovate or invest in their workforce. That hurts working families, and it hurts our economy. All told, between rising prices and lowering wages, lack of competition costs the median American household $5,000 a year.</p>, <p>Now, look, I'm a proud capitalist. I spent most of my career representing the corporate State of Delaware. I know America can't succeed unless American business succeeds. But let me be very clear: Capitalism without competition isn't capitalism; it's exploitation. Without healthy competition, big players can change and charge whatever they want and treat you however they want. And for too many Americans, that means accepting a bad deal for things that can't go—you can't go without.</p>, <p>So we know we've got a problem, a major problem. But we also have an incredible opportunity. We can bring back more competition to more of the country, helping entrepreneurs and small businesses get in the game, helping workers get a better deal, helping families save money every month. The good news is: We've done it before.</p>, <p>In the early 1900s, President Teddy Roosevelt saw an economy dominated by giants like Standard Oil and JP Morgan's railroads. He took them on, and he won. And he gave the little guy a fighting chance.</p>, <p>Decades later, during the Great Depression, his cousin Franklin Roosevelt saw a wave of corporate mergers that wiped out scores of small businesses, crushing competition and innovation. So he ramped up antitrust enforcement eightfold in just 2 years, saving families billions in today's dollars and helping to set the course for sustained economic growth after World War II.</p>, <p>He also called for an economic bill of rights, including, quote, ""the right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies."" End of quote.</p>, <p>Between them, the two Roosevelts established an American tradition, an antitrust tradition. It is how we ensure that our economy isn't about people working for capitalism, it's about capitalism working for people.</p>, <p>But, over time, we've lost the fundamental American idea that true capitalism depends on fair and open competition. Forty years ago, we chose the wrong path, in my view, following the misguided philosophy of people like Robert Bork, and pulled back on enforcing laws to promote competition.</p>, <p>We're now 40 years into the experiment of letting giant corporations accumulate more and more power. And where—what have we gotten from it? Less growth, weakened investment, fewer small businesses. Too many Americans who feel left behind. Too many people who are poorer than their parents. I believe the experiment failed. We have to get back to an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out.</p>, <p>The Executive order I'm soon going to be signing commits the Federal Government to full and aggressive enforcement of our antitrust laws. No more tolerance for abusive actions by monopolies. No more bad mergers that lead to mass layoffs, higher prices, fewer options for workers and consumers alike.</p>, <p>My Executive order includes 72 specific actions. I expect the Federal agencies—and they know this—[<i>laughter</i>]—to help restore competition so that we have lower prices, higher wages, more money, more options, and more convenience for the American people.</p>, <p>Today I want to focus on three specific actions. First, the FDA—the Food and Drug Administration—are going to work with States and Tribes to safely import prescription drugs from Canada. That's just one of many actions in the Executive order that will lower prescription drug prices.</p>, <p>Second, the FDA is going to issue rules so that hearing aids can be sold over the counter. That's something the last administration was supposed to have done, but didn't do. We're going to get it done. After these rules go into effect, a pair of hearing aids can cost hundreds of dollars, not thousands. And you'll be able to pick them up at your local drugstore.</p>, <p>Third, we're going to improve competition for workers. I've talked a lot about noncompete agreements, contracts that say you can't take another job in your field, even if you get a better deal. I made a speech—I was just reminiscing with my staff—back in 2018, at the Brookings Institution, where I talked about the noncompete clauses that were just, I found to be, absolutely ridiculous, but how prevalent they were throughout industries.</p>, <p>At least one in three businesses require their workers to sign a noncompete agreement. These aren't just high-paid executives or scientists who hold secret formulas for Coca-Cola so Pepsi can't get their hands on it. A recent study found one in five workers without a college education is subject to noncompete agreements. They're construction workers, hotel workers, disproportionately women and women of color.</p>, <p>Think of the 26-year-old employee at a company. She's a star worker, but she isn't being treated right. She's underpaid, passed over for promotions. A competitor across the street knows it and wants to bring her in at a higher wage, but she can't do it. Her company threatens legal action over a noncompete clause she had to sign in order to get hired in the first place. She can't afford a lawyer for help, so she's locked in.</p>, <p>Imagine if you're in her shoes. You'd feel powerless, disrespected, bullied, trapped. That's not right. Workers should be free to take a better job if someone offers it. If your employer wants to keep you, he or she should have to make it worth your while to stay. That's the kind of competition that leads to better wages and greater dignity of work.</p>, <p>Look, I'm not going to go into it now, but I used to talk about, you know, there's noncompete clauses of people running the machines that lay down asphalt. If in fact you get offered a job and you have a—you know, you're in Arkansas doing it, a lot of—a specific example is, you can't take a job in West Texas to do it. What in the hell does that have to do with anything? [<i>Laughter</i>] No, I'm serious. Or there were clauses in McDonald's contracts: You can't leave Burger King to go to McDonald's. Come on. Is there a trade secret about what's inside that patty? [<i>Laughter</i>] No, but I'm serious.</p>, <p>You all—I don't know whether you do know—I didn't know it until 5 years ago—the incredible number of noncompete clauses for ordinary people who—it was done for one reason: to keep wages low. Period. Look, my Executive order calls on the FTC to ban or limit noncompete agreements. Let workers chose who they want to work for.</p>, <p>I'm also calling on the FTC to do away with certain occupational licensing requirements. You realize, if you want to—you braid hair and you move from one State to another, sometimes you have to do a 6-month apprenticeship, even though you've been in the business for a long, long time? What the hell—what's that all about?</p>, <p>Military families, for example, they're often on the move between States with each new assignment. So you have a woman in the military, her husband is following her, or vice versa. Guess what? If you have—if you're a plumber, you have to get a different license when you move from Delaware to Missouri.</p>, <p>Look, it can't be a significant burden to get a new license in a new home State. That burden can't be around anymore. It takes time and it takes money. It takes a toll on a family's income while you're waiting. We should remove that barrier, providing more mobility, more opportunity, higher wages for families on the move.</p>, <p>This is something that my wife Jill has worked on together with Michelle Obama through the Joining Forces initiative for the military. We're going to keep that moving. We're going to get it done in an Executive order.</p>, <p>Let me close with this: Competition works. We know it works. We've seen it works when it exists. Fair competition is was what made America the wealthiest, most innovative nation in history. That's why people come here to invent things and start new businesses.</p>, <p>In the competition against China and other nations in the 21st century, let's show that American democracy and the American people can truly outcompete anyone. Because I know that just given half a chance, the American people will never, ever, ever let their country down. Imagine if we give everyone a full and fair chance. That's what this is all about. That's what I'm about to do.</p>, <p>So I'd like to invite the Cabinet members up here. I'd like to—and the Attorney General is here, General Garland. Xavier—Mr. Secretary, you can come up too. I've been watching on television; you've been really good. [<i>Laughter</i>] Gina Raimondo. Also, Pete Buttigieg. And the Chair of the FCC [FTC],* Lian—excuse me, Lina Khan, Acting Chair of the FTC. And Director of the National Economic Council.</p>, <p>Am I leaving anybody out? Anyway, come on up. [<i>Laughter</i>] This may be the first Cabinet meeting we've had.</p>, <p>Okay. ""Promoting Competition in the American Economy.""</p>, <p>First pen. [<i>Laughter</i>] Second pen. Third. Fourth. [<i>Laughter</i>] Fifth. I'm wondering how Barack did this with a shorter name. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the Executive order.</i>]</p>, <p>Thank you. [<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you, everyone.</p>, <p><i>President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia/Russia-U.S. Cooperation on Responding to Ransomware Attacks </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, how did President Putin respond to your call today, sir? How did President Putin respond to your call today, sir?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I made it very clear to him that—that the United States expects, when a ransomware operation is coming from his soil, even though it's not—not—sponsored by the state, we expect them to act if we give them enough information to act on who that is.</p>, <p>And secondly, that we have set up a means of communications now, on a regular basis, to be able to communicate to one another when each of us thinks something is happening in another country that affects the home country.</p>, <p>And so it went well. I'm optimistic.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>You said, 3 weeks ago, there would be consequences. Will there be, sir?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>]"
16,4,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on United States Military Operations in Afghanistan and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-united-states-military-operations-afghanistan-and-exchange-with-reporters,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good afternoon.</p>, <p>Earlier today I was briefed by our senior military and national security leaders on the status of the drawdown of U.S. forces and allied forces in Afghanistan.</p>, <p>When I announced our drawdown in April, I said we would be out by September, and we're on track to meet that target. Our military mission in Afghanistan will conclude on August 31. The drawdown is proceeding in a secure and orderly way, prioritizing the safety of our troops as they depart.</p>, <p>Our military commanders advised me that once I made the decision to end the war, we needed to move swiftly to conduct the main elements of the drawdown. And in this context, speed is safety. And thanks to the way in which we have managed our withdrawal, no one—no one U.S. forces or any forces have—have been lost. Conducting our drawdown differently would have certainly come with a increased risk of safety to our personnel.</p>, <p>To me, those risks were unacceptable. And there was never any doubt that our military would perform this task efficiently and with the highest level of professionalism. That's what they do. And the same is true of our NATO allies and partners who have supported—we are supporting, and supporting us as well, as they conclude their retrograde.</p>, <p>I want to be clear: The U.S. military mission in Afghanistan continues through the end of August. We remain—we retain personnel and capacities in the country, and we maintain some authority—excuse me, the same authority under which we've been operating for some time.</p>, <p>As I said in April, the United States did what we went to do in Afghanistan: to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 and to deliver justice to Usama bin Laden and to degrade the terrorist threat to keep Afghanistan from becoming a base from which attacks could be continued against the United States. We achieved those objectives. That's why we went.</p>, <p>We did not go to Afghanistan to nation-build. And it's the right and the responsibility of the Afghan people alone to decide their future and how they want to run their country.</p>, <p>Together, with our NATO allies and partners, we have trained and equipped over three hundred—nearly 300,000 current serving members of the military—of the Afghan National Security Force, and many beyond that who are no longer serving. Add to that, hundreds of thousands more Afghan National Defense and Security Forces trained over the last two decades.</p>, <p>We provided our Afghan partners with all the tools—let me emphasize—all the tools, training, and equipment of any modern military. We provided advanced weaponry. And we're going to continue to provide funding and equipment. And we'll ensure they have the capacity to maintain their air force.</p>, <p>But most critically, as I stressed in my meeting just 2 weeks ago with President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah, Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future that the Afghan people want and they deserve. In our meeting, I also assured Ghani that U.S. support for the people of Afghanistan will endure. We will continue to provide civilian and humanitarian assistance, including speaking out for the rights of women and girls.</p>, <p>I intend to maintain our diplomatic precedence [presence]* in Afghanistan, and we are coordinating closely with our international partners in order to continue to secure the international airport. And we're going to engage in a determined diplomacy to pursue peace and a peace agreement that will end this senseless violence.</p>, <p>I've asked Secretary of State Blinken and our Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation to work vigorously with the parties in Afghanistan, as well as the regional and international stakeholders to support a negotiated solution. To be clear—to be clear: Countries in the region have an essential role to play in supporting a peaceful settlement. We'll work with them, and they should help step up their efforts as well.</p>, <p>We're going to continue to work for the release of detained Americans, including Mark—excuse me—Frerichs—I want to pronounce the name correctly; I misspoke—so that he can return to his family safely.</p>, <p>We're also going to continue to make sure that we take on the Afghan nationals who work side-by-side with U.S. forces, including interpreters and translators—since we're no longer going to have military there after this; we're not going to need them and they have no jobs—who are also going to be vital to our efforts so they—and they've been very vital—and so their families are not exposed to danger as well. We've already dramatically accelerated the procedure time for special immigrant visas to bring them to the United States.</p>, <p>Since I was inaugurated on January 20, we've already approved 2,500 special immigrant visas to come to the United States. Up to now, fewer than half have exercised their right to do that. Half have gotten on aircraft and commercial flights and come, and the other half believe they want to stay, at least thus far.</p>, <p>We're working closely with Congress to change the authorization legislation so that we can streamline the process of approving those visas. And those who have stood up for the operation to physically relocate thousands of Afghans and their families before the U.S. military mission concludes so that, if they choose, they can wait safely outside of Afghanistan while their U.S. visas are being processed.</p>, <p>The operation has identified U.S. facilities outside of the continental United States, as well as in third countries, to host our Afghan allies, if they choose—if they so choose. And this—starting this month, we're going to begin relocation flights for Afghanistan SIV applicants and their families who choose to leave.</p>, <p>We have a point person in the White House and at the State Department-led task force coordinating all these efforts. But our message to those women and men is clear: There is a home for you in the United States if you so choose, and we will stand with you just as you stood with us.</p>, <p>When I made the decision to end the U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, I judged that it was not in the national interest of the United States of America to continue fighting this war indefinitely. I made the decision with clear eyes, and I am briefed daily on the battlefield updates.</p>, <p>But for those who have argued that we should stay just 6 more months or just 1 more year, I ask them to consider the lessons of recent history. In 2011, the NATO allies and partners agreed that we would end our combat mission in 2014. In 2014, some argued, ""One more year."" So we kept fighting, and we kept taking casualties. In 2015, the same. And on and on.</p>, <p>Nearly 20 years of experience has shown us that the current security situation only confirms that ""just 1 more year"" of fighting in Afghanistan is not a solution, but a recipe for being there indefinitely. It's up to Afghans to make the decision about the future of their country.</p>, <p>Others are more direct. Their argument is that we should stay with the Afghan—in Afghanistan indefinitely. In doing so, they point to the fact that we have not taken losses in this last year, so they claim that the cost of just maintaining the status quo is minimal.</p>, <p>But that ignores the reality and the facts that already presented on the ground in Afghanistan when I took office: The Taliban was at its strongest—is at its strongest militarily since 2001.</p>, <p>The number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan had been reduced to a bare minimum. And the United States, in the last administration, made an agreement that the—with the Taliban to remove all our forces by May 1 of this past—of this year. That's what I inherited. That agreement was the reason the Taliban had ceased major attacks against U.S. forces.</p>, <p>If, in April, I had instead announced that the United States was going to back—going back on that agreement made by the last administration [that]* the United States and allied forces would remain in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future, the Taliban would have again begun to target our forces.</p>, <p>The status quo was not an option. Staying would have meant U.S. troops taking casualties, American men and women back in the middle of a civil war. And we would have run the risk of having to send more troops back into Afghanistan to defend our remaining troops. Once that agreement with the Taliban had been made, staying with a bare minimum force was no longer possible.</p>, <p>So let me ask those who wanted us to stay: How many more—how many thousands more of America's daughters and sons are you willing to risk? How long would you have them stay? Already we have members of our military whose parents fought in Afghanistan 20 years ago. Would you send their children and their grandchildren as well? Would you send your own son or daughter?</p>, <p>After 20 years, a trillion dollars spent training and equipping hundreds of thousands of Afghan National Security and Defense Forces, 2,448 Americans killed, 20,722 more wounded, and untold thousands coming home with unseen trauma to their mental health, I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome.</p>, <p>The United States cannot afford to remain tethered to policies creating a response to a world as it was 20 years ago. We need to meet the threats where they are today. Today, the terrorist threat has metastasized beyond Afghanistan. So we are repositioning our resources and adapting our counterterrorism posture to meet the threats where they are now significantly higher: in South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.</p>, <p>But make no mistake: Our military and intelligence leaders are confident they have the capabilities to protect the homeland and our interests from any resurgent terrorist challenge emerging or emanating from Afghanistan. We are developing a counterterrorism over-the-horizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region and act quickly and decisively if needed.</p>, <p>And we also need to focus on shoring up America's core strengths to meet the strategic competition with China and other nations that is really going to determine our future. We have to defeat COVID-19 at home and around the world, make sure we're better prepared for the next pandemic or biological threat. We need to establish international norms for cyberspace and the use of emergency—emerging technologies. We need to take concerted action to fight existential threats of climate change.</p>, <p>And we will be more formidable to our adversaries and competitors over the long run if we fight the battles of the next 20 years, not the last 20 years.</p>, <p>Finally, I want to recognize the incredible sacrifice and dedication that the U.S. military and civilian personnel, serving alongside our allies and partners, have made over the last two decades in Afghanistan.</p>, <p>I want to honor the significance of what they've accomplished and the great personal risk they encountered and the incredible cost to their families: pursuing the terrorist threat in some of the most unforgiving terrain on the planet—and I've been almost throughout that entire country; ensuring there hasn't been another attack on the homeland from Afghanistan for the last 20 years; taking out bin Laden.</p>, <p>I want to thank you all for your service and the dedication to the mission so many of you have given and to the sacrifices that you and your families have made over the long course of this war.</p>, <p>We'll never forget those who gave the last full measure of devotion for their country in Afghanistan, nor those whose lives have been immeasurably altered by wounds sustained in service to their country. We're ending America's longest war, but we'll always—always—honor the bravery of the American patriots who served in it.</p>, <p>May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Afghan Military Capability </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President—do you trust the Taliban, Mr. President?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, why can't you evacuate—Mr. President, why can't you evacuate——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Is a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan now inevitable?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, it is not.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Why?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Because you—the Afghan troops have 300,000 well-equipped—as well-equipped as any army in the world—and an air force against something like 75,000 Taliban. It is not inevitable.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, why can't you evacuate——<i> </i></p>, <p><i>Taliban/Afghan Military Capability </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Do you trust the Taliban, Mr. President? Do you trust the Taliban, sir?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Are you—is that a serious question?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>It is absolutely a serious question. Do you trust the Taliban?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I do not.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Do you trust handing over the country to the Taliban?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, I do not trust the Taliban.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>So why are you handing the country over?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, is the U.S. responsible for the deaths of Afghans after you leave the country?</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, will you amplify that question, please? Will you amplify your answer, please—why you don't trust the Taliban?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> It's a silly question. Do I trust the Taliban? No. But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped, and more competent in terms of conducting war.</p>, <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>, <p><i>U.S. Counterterrorism Mission in Afghanistan/Reconciliation Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you, Mr. President. Given the amount of money that has been spent and the number of lives that have been lost, in your view, with making this decision, were the last 20 years worth it?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> You know my record. I can tell by the way you asked the question.</p>, <p>I opposed permanently having American forces in Afghanistan. I argued, from the beginning, as you may recall—it came to light after the administration was over, last administration—our administration—no nation has ever unified Afghanistan. No nation. Empires have gone there and not done it.</p>, <p>The focus we had—and I strongly support it—and you may remember I physically went to Afghanistan. I was up in that pass where Usama bin Laden was—allegedly escaped or—out of harm's way. We went for two reasons: one, to bring Usama bin Laden to the gates of hell, as I said at the time. The second reason was to eliminate Al Qaida's capacity to deal with more attacks on the United States from that territory. We accomplished both of those objectives—period.</p>, <p>That's what I believed, from the beginning, why we should be and why we should have gone to Afghanistan. That job had been over for some time. And that's why I believe that this is the right decision and, quite frankly, overdue.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, what's your top general——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, has the civilian government failed the people of Afghanistan?</p>, <p><i>Reconciliation Efforts/Afghan Military Capability/Continued U.S. Assistance </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Thank you. Mr. President, thank you very much. Your own intelligence community has assessed that the Afghan Government will likely collapse.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That is not true.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Is it—can you please clarify what they have told you about whether that will happen or not?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> That is not true. They did not—they didn't—did not reach that conclusion.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>So what is the level of confidence that they have that it will not collapse?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> The Afghan Government and leadership has to come together. They clearly have the capacity to sustain the Government in place. The question is: Will they generate the kind of cohesion to do it? It's not a question of whether they have the capacity. They have the capacity. They have the forces. They have the equipment. The question is: Will they do it?</p>, <p>And I want to make clear what I made clear to Ghani: that we are not going just sus—walk away and not sustain their ability to maintain that force. We are. We're going to also work to make sure we help them in terms of everything from food necessities and other things in—in the region. But——</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> How—sorry.</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>But there's not a conclusion that, in fact, they cannot defeat the Taliban.</p>, <p>I believe the only way there's going to be—this is now Joe Biden, not the intelligence community—the only way there's ultimately going to be peace and security in Afghanistan is that they work out a modus vivendi with the Taliban and they make a judgment as to how they can make peace.</p>, <p>And the likelihood there's going to be one unified government in Afghanistan controlling the whole country is highly unlikely.</p>, <p><i>Taliban/Reconciliation Efforts </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President—Mr. President, thank you. But we have talked to your own top general in Afghanistan, General Scott Miller. He told ABC News the conditions are so concerning at this point that it could result in a civil war. So, if Kabul falls to the Taliban, what will the United States do about it?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Look, you've said two things—one, that if it could result in a civil war—that's different than the Taliban succeeding, number one. Number two, the question of what will be done is going to be implicated—is going to implicate the entire region as well. There's a number of countries who have a grave concern about what's going to happen in Afghanistan relative to their security.</p>, <p>The question is: How much of a threat to the United States of America and to our allies is whatever results in terms of a government or an agreement? That's when that judgement will be made.</p>, <p><i>Taliban/U.S. Military Exit From Vietnam </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, some Vietnamese veterans see echoes of their experience in this withdrawal in Afghanistan. Do you see any parallels between this withdrawal and what happened in Vietnam, with some people feeling——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> None whatsoever. Zero. What you had is—you had entire brigades breaking through the gates of our Embassy, six, if I'm not mistaken.</p>, <p>The Taliban is not the south—the North Vietnamese army. They're not remotely comparable in terms of capability. There's going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of a Embassy in the—of the United States from Afghanistan. It is not at all comparable.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>And, Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, can I——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I'll take him, and then I'll—and then I'll go—I'll go to the other side. Hang on a second.</p>, <p><i>Corruption Issues in Afghanistan/Reconciliation Efforts/Taliban </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, how serious was the corruption among the Afghanistan Government to this mission failing there?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, first of all, the mission hasn't failed yet. There is in Afghanistan—in all parties, there's been corruption. The question is, can there be an agreement on unity of purpose? What is the objective?</p>, <p>For example, it started off—there were going to be negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan National Security Forces and the Afghan Government. That of—it didn't come to—it didn't come to fruition.</p>, <p>So the question now is, where do they go from here? That—the jury is still out. But the likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.</p>, <p>Yes, ma'am.</p>, <p><i>Withdrawal of U.S. Military Forces From Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, will the United States be responsible for the loss of Afghan civilian lives that could happen after the——</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>——military exit?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, no, no. It's up to the people of Afghanistan to decide on what government they want, not us to impose the government on them. No country has ever been able to do that. Keep in mind, as a student of history, as I'm sure you are, never has Afghanistan been a united country, not in all of its history. Not in all of its history.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>U.S. Counterterrorism Mission in Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, if this isn't a ""mission accomplished"" moment, what is it, in your view?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> No, there's no ""mission accomplished.""</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>How would you describe it?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> The mission was accomplished in that we get—got Usama bin Laden, and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President—[<i>inaudible</i>]——</p>, <p><i>Evacuation of Afghan Interpreters and Other Service Contractors Who Assisted With U.S. Military Operations in Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, if ""speed is safety,"" as you just said in your remarks, are you satisfied with the timeline of relocating Afghan nationals? Is it happening quickly enough to your satisfaction, if it may not happen until next month, at the end?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Well, much of it has already happened. There's already been people—about a thousand people have gotten on aircraft and come home—come to the United States already on commercial aircraft. So, as I said, there's over 2,500 people that as—from January to now, have gotten those visas. And only half decided that they wanted to leave.</p>, <p>The point is that I think the whole process has to be speeded up, period, in terms of being able to get these visas.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Why can't the U.S. evacuate these Afghan translators to the United States to await their visa processing as some immigrants at the southern border have been allowed to do?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Because the law doesn't allow that to happen. And that's why we're asking the Congress to consider changing the law.</p>, <p>But in the meantime, we can guarantee their safety, if they wish to leave, by taking them to third countries and/or, while the wait is taking place, to come to—and hopefully, while they're waiting there, to be able to bring them back to the United States, if that's what they choose to do.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>And what do you make—and what do you make, sir, of the Taliban being in Russia today?</p>, <p><i>Status of Women and Girls in Afghanistan </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, I'm from Afghanistan. I am Afghan—[<i>inaudible</i>]—woman. Any message—good message for Afghan women in future? Because they have achievement, they are really concerned about their achievement.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> They are very concerned, with good reason.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Yes.</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> When I was in Afghanistan—I've been there a number of times—I remember being in a school outside and—and by the way, the schools in Afghanistan are not fundamentally unlike schools in the West Coast, where they have, you know, an area in the middle that is sort of like—it looks like a playground and single-story buildings connected around it.</p>, <p>And I remember saying to—speaking to a group of young women—I guess they were roughly—don't hold me to this—they look like they'd be 14, 15 years old. And they're in school, and there's a tiered classroom with single light bulbs hanging from the ceiling, as I know you know.</p>, <p>And I said: ""You know, the United States came here to make sure that we got this terrorist, Usama bin Laden and that terrorists didn't amass again to go after our country. And then, we're going to have to leave."" And a young woman said: ""You can't leave. You can't leave."" It was—it was heartbreaking. ""You can't leave,"" she said. ""I want to be a doctor. I want to be a doctor. I want to be a doctor. And if you leave, I'll never be able to be a doctor."" Well, that's why we spent so much time and money training the Afghan Security Forces to do the work of defending that. If every work—well, anyway—so yes, I'm aware.</p>, <p>I'm going to take one more question.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, have you spoken with any Taliban officials about the withdrawal?</p>, <p><i>The President. </i>[<i>Inaudible</i>]</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, can you explain—[<i>laughter</i>]——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>[<i>Inaudible</i>]—the Taliban being in Russia today—the Taliban——</p>, <p><i>Taliban/Afghan Military Capability </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr.—Mr. President, I—[<i>laughter</i>]—thank you. I wanted to ask: With the benefit of hindsight, you've spoken to the fact that the Taliban are sort of at their militarily strongest point that you've seen in 20 years. How do you feel personally about that, with the benefit of hindsight and all of the dollars and investment and American troops that were sent there?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> Relative to the training and capacity of the ANSF and the training of the federal police, they're not even close in terms of their capacity.</p>, <p>I was making the point—the point was that here we were; I was—the argument is: ""Well, we could stay because no one was dying. No Americans are being shot. So why leave?"" Once the agreement was made by the last administration that we were going to leave by May 1, it was very clear that a Taliban that had always been a problem was even a more sophisticated problem than they were—than before. Not more sophisticated than the ANSF, than Government. More than they were.</p>, <p>The point being that it would have increased the prospect that they would have been able to take more lives of Americans if they decided we weren't going to go after them. That was the point I was making.</p>, <p>Thank you all so very much. Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Have you spoken with any Taliban officials on the withdrawal?</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President——</p>]"
16,5,Joseph R. Biden,"Remarks on Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation and Education and Family Assistance Legislation in Crystal Lake, Illinois",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-infrastructure-and-jobs-legislation-and-education-and-family-assistance,"[<p>Thank you, Edith. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please. Please, be seated.</p>, <p>Mr. President—what he hadn't told you today: He had to delay his vacation to be here today. [<i>Laughter</i>] He heard Biden is coming. He goes, ""Oh, my God, when is he coming?"" [<i>Laughter</i>] But—[<i>laughter</i>]—so he could show me around McHenry County College.</p>, <p>I'm glad to be here with great Illinois leaders. I want you all to—you know, America is back. America is back. And in no small part because of the men and women that I serve with.</p>, <p>Governor Pritzker, stand up, man. Stand up. This is a good man.</p>, <p>If you really want someone in a foxhole with you when you're in trouble, you want Senator Tammy Duckworth. Tammy. And the guy I rely on more than anyone else in the United States Senate—and I've served with him for years; we have a lot in common in terms of losses as well as gains—is Dick Durbin. Dick.</p>, <p>And Congresswoman Underwood, who got me a passport to her town. Her mom and dad are mildly proud with good reason. [<i>Laughter</i>] Good reason. Actually, her mom looks like her sister. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Last week, I was up in Wisconsin to talk about a bipartisan agreement to modernize American infrastructure and, in the process, create millions of good-paying jobs. That's not my estimate, that's Wall Street estimates, that's everybody's estimate. Millions of good-paying jobs. Not $7, not $8, not $10, not even $15 an hour. Good, prevailing-wage jobs.</p>, <p>And here's what it means for Illinois: You've got, like many States—all States—you've got 230—2,374 bridges and over 6,200 miles of highway that are in disrepair. As a result, every driver in this State pays a hidden tax of about $600 per year in wasted time and wasted fuel because of the nature of the roads and bridges—and by the way, you're better than a lot of States—not to mention the challenge of getting to work or getting to the daycare center on time to avoid that late fee when you pick up your child.</p>, <p>Your Governor has an ambitious infrastructure plan, and under a bipartisan infrastructure agreement, we're going to make the biggest investment in roads and bridges since the construction of the Interstate Highway System, literally creating millions of good-paying jobs.</p>, <p>And, God willing, we're not going to have 40 weeks of ""This is Infrastructure Week."" [<i>Laughter</i>] Remember those?</p>, <p>Think what it will mean to McHenry's entrepreneurial agricultural program if we can get products more easily to Chicago. Or think about how much easier life will be when it's quicker to drive on Randall Road. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>Look, this agreement also allows us to replace every lead pipe and service line in America, benefitting 10 million homes. It's going to address lead exposure to 400,000 of our schools and daycare facilities where children drink that water. This would be the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history when we pass it.</p>, <p>In every—1 in every 10 people in Illinois lacks access to high-speed internet. The bipartisan agreement that Dick and others have made sure we're getting, the agreement allows us to connect every American to reliable, high-speed, affordable internet—every single American, rural and urban. And by the way, those of you who are parents, who had kids at home, tell me what internet means this last year. [<i>Laughter</i>] If they're school age.</p>, <p>Well, from 2010 to 2020, Illinois experienced 49 extreme weather events—although I heard today from the Senator north of here that there—a Republican Senator—there is no global warming. Just so you know, there's no such thing. [<i>Laughter</i>] But those weather events cost this State roughly $50 billion in damages. And we're going to up upgrade the electric grid to make it more resilient to extreme weather and other threats.</p>, <p>There's a lot more the agreement is going to do to encourage the physical and ensure—the physical infrastructure that lays the foundation for a strong, durable, and sustainable competitive economy. But what I want to talk to you about today is human infrastructure. It's essential to that foundation, as well. To truly win the 21st century and once again lead the world, to truly build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, to truly deal everybody in this time, we need to invest in our people. We need to invest in our people.</p>, <p>That's why, in addition to the bipartisan infrastructure agreement that I believe we're going to get done, I'm here to make the case for the second critical part of my domestic agenda. It's a combination of parts of my American Jobs Plan that were essential and not included in the bipartisan infrastructure plan, as well as my American Families Plan.</p>, <p>In Washington, they call it a reconciliation bill. That's a fancy way of saying, with a filibuster that our friends on the other side use constantly—more than ever been used in history—it means you got to get 60 votes to get anything done. We're 50-50 Senate with a Vice President who happens to be a Democrat.</p>, <p>And back in the campaign, you know, I said we're going to build back, and we're going to build back better. Not just—we can't just build back; we've got to build back better. And today I want to outline some of the key pieces of this Build Back Better agenda and what's it going to do for the people of Illinois and the people of the United States.</p>, <p>It's about a country, once again, that inspires and leads the world with the opportunities we provide, the cures we discovery, the technology—that we discover—the technologies we pioneer, and industries we create. You know, and a nation that leads the world in combating the existential threat of climate change.</p>, <p>The Build Back Better plan—agenda starts with education. You know, one of the reasons why we were the leading country in the world for so long, and still on the edges, is because we're the first nation—industrial nation in the world to require—to allow 12 years of free education back at the turn of the 20th century. But everybody has caught up.</p>, <p>At the time, they were debating what should be education in America. The argument was there should be 12 years of free education. And that's what's got us ahead. That's what had us leap ahead of the rest of the world.</p>, <p>But as of today, everybody has caught up. Does anybody think, in the 21st century, with the change that's taking place in technology and across the board, that 12 years of education is enough to be able to live a middle class life? I don't think so. And so the fact of the matter is, we've decided—I've decided we should have a minimum of 14 years of education. Fourteen years of education—which I'll explain in a second.</p>, <p>You know, as the First Lady—I'm Jill Biden's husband, but—[<i>laughter</i>]—but as Jill would say—and she's a full-time community college professor while being the First Lady—she often says, ""Any nation that outeducates us is going to outcompete us."" Any nation that outeducates us is going to out compete us.</p>, <p>That's why I want to guarantee an additional 4 additional years of public education for every person in America, starting with providing 2 years of universal, high-quality preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds, building on what the Governor has been doing here in Illinois.</p>, <p>In the last 10 years, studies out of the great universities—study of a high-quality program here in Chicago—found that low-income children participating in preschool were 47 percent more likely to earn an associate's degree or higher and get through school without any difficulty. We have to build on that foundation for future success. And then, I want to add 2 years of free community college for everyone. And we can afford it. I'll tell you how.</p>, <p>That could boost the earnings of a high school graduate with low-wage jobs by nearly $6,000 a year on average. The average annual cost of a 2-year degree in Illinois is $4,200. Under my proposal, that cost would be zero.</p>, <p>But it's not just tuition that's expensive; as was pointed out, living expenses, housing, meals, transportation. And that's why I propose to increase a maximum Pell Grant—which, if you are below a certain income, you qualify for a Pell Grant—from about $6,500 to $8,000 a year. And that will fill it out.</p>, <p>I know that here at McHenry, you have a dual-enrollment program so students from places like Woodstock High School and other high schools, you get credit for taking college classes here. Well, my plan will provide resources to expand programs like the one you have here.</p>, <p>My plan will also do more to invest in high-quality job training and apprenticeships in fast-growing sectors like public health, childcare, manufacturing, information technology, clean energy so that all Americans can get the skills that employers want that lead to good middle class and—I was—I make no apology—union jobs.</p>, <p>It would also make strategic investments in teachers—in the teacher pipeline. Because even before the pandemic, our school system was 100,000 teachers short here in America, particularly in high-demand areas.</p>, <p>Our children are the kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft, and our teachers are the ones that help them believe they can do anything. I'll bet every one of your success can name the teacher that helped change your life. I'll bet every one—every one of us. There's somebody who came along and made us believe in ourselves. That's the really secret—the secret of teachers. My plan will reduce student debt for future teachers, double the size of the annual Federal scholarships for future teachers.</p>, <p>We'll also support $100 billion in school infrastructure improvements, including community college, to make sure that they are safe and healthy places for learning, and that all students—with the labs and technology they need to be able to compete in the 21st century.</p>, <p>Of course, an ability to take these jobs often depends on the availability of childcare. As a single father, when I first got to the Senate, I had two young boys who had just lost their mom and their sister in an automobile accident. If I hadn't had the family I have—my sister, best—my younger sister, my best friend, and my brother, and my mom help out—I couldn't have done it. But not everybody has that kind of support.</p>, <p>I just toured your Children's Learning Center. It's an amazing resource. Students and faculty can have their children cared for. Students can earn their associate degrees in early childhood education as well. High-quality childcare options should be the rule, not the exception.</p>, <p>So, on my way in here, I met with Mike Sayre, who wrote me a letter about his struggle to find affordable childcare, and he wanted me to—he wanted to know what my plans were. Well, Mike, I hope you know now. Here we are. My plan is to provide access to quality, affordable childcare with more childcare centers in community college campuses with new and upgraded childcare facilities all across the country.</p>, <p>Businesses—businesses will get a full tax credit to build onsite facilities. And the reason they want to do that is not just to be nice. Business—because studies show when there's an onsite childcare center, businesses have less employee turnover, less absenteeism, and higher productivity. It's overwhelmingly in their interest to do it.</p>, <p>Middle class families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality childcare for children up to age 5. And the most hard-pressed working families won't have to pay a dime. My plan will also invest in childcare workforce with better wages, benefits, and training opportunities.</p>, <p>Look, we're also going to give parents the option to take up to an $8,000 tax credit to cover childcare expenses, if that's the preferred route. That's good for families, and it's good for the economy, and it will create more jobs.</p>, <p>My plan will also provide up to 12 weeks of paid family leave for medical care—up to 12 weeks of paid family leave. Look, we're one of the few major economies in the world that doesn't cover paid family and medical leave. And the most difficult moments some will ever face: no one should have to choose between a job and a paycheck and take caring of someone you love—a parent, a spouse, a child.</p>, <p>Look, we will tackle the maternal mortality crisis, as well, that impacts on Black and Native American mothers disproportionately. And what—and I want to thank Congresswoman Underwood for her leadership in this area. For real.</p>, <p>As I've said again and again, people who really need a tax break in this country are America's working families. It's time they get a tax break.</p>, <p>So my Build Back Better agenda would extend the expanded child tax credit we passed under my American Rescue Plan. Those of you who have children under the age of 7 [6],* you're going to get—and depending on your income and your income taxes—you're going to get a cash payment back. Up to now, guess what? You get $2,000 to declare a dependent. If you have two children, you get $4,000 off a $10,000 tax bill. It's important.</p>, <p>But if you don't have enough—you don't have enough—you don't make enough money to be able to have—to owe that kind of tax, you don't get a tax credit, you don't get anything. Well, under this proposal, guess what? You're in a situation where if you have a child under the age of 7 [6],* you get back $3,600 in cash. In addition to that, those of you who are in that situation are going to start to see that coming in by the end of this month, on a monthly basis. It can change the lives of people.</p>, <p>Starting next week, families will begin to receive one of the largest ever single-year tax cuts aimed to families with children. And every child under age 6 is $3,600; every child between 6 and 17 is $3,000. It's not as a credit against your taxes, but a direct payment. You'll get cash. Cash. That's what you'll get.</p>, <p>For example, a middle class family with two children can expect to receive $7,200. You'll get the first half—the $3,600—paid out at $600 a month between July and December, and you'll get the rest between January and tax day. With this one tax cut, every study shows that childcare is cutting poverty in half—by 40 percent. Families with children who qualify for this, it cuts poverty by 40 percent.</p>, <p>So let's extend the tax cut at least through 2025, and let's expand free meals for millions more children in schools, with the assistance during the summer months when they don't have access to those school meals.</p>, <p>We support families with children. We also need to provide greater dignity for our Nation's senior citizens who care for them. Look, there are hundreds of thousands of older adults and people with disabilities who need home- and community-based care services. They qualify for it under Medicaid, but there's a backlog of thousands of people. But one study showed that $3,000 spent helping a senior stay in their home by providing—it saves the country more than $20,000 a year in medical costs.</p>, <p>At the same time, more than 1.5 million Americans work in homecare. They're disproportionately women, women of color, and immigrants, and those jobs are among the lowest paid in our economy. One in six homecare workers lives in poverty. We need to do better on both sides of the equation.</p>, <p>My plan expands homecare for older and disabled Americans, while improving jobs and pay for homecare workers who care for them. And here's the deal: You save a lot of money if you don't have to go to a home. Keeping people in their own home, mentally and every other way, is a benefit—a significant benefit for the community, as well as cost.</p>, <p>We also need to continue to make health care more affordable. When we lowered premiums and expanded coverage for the American—in my American Rescue Plan, more than 1.5 million people signed up for what used to be called ""Obamacare."" I want to make these premium reductions permanent so we can get even more people covered.</p>, <p>We need to deal with the shortage of affordable housing in America. Over 10 million renters in this country pay more than half their income for the rent on their apartment, and the lack of affordable housing prevents people from moving to communities where there are more opportunities.</p>, <p>So we're going to make historic investment in affordable housing, increasing and improving the housing supply by building and rehabilitating more than 2 million homes, especially in places that need more housing.</p>, <p>And we need to invest not just in the physical and human infrastructure of today, we need to invest in the jobs and industries of tomorrow. Three decades ago—and this always disturbs me, even just repeating it—three decades ago, the United States was number one in the world for a share of their GDP being invested in research and development. We were number one in the world. We're now number eight [nine]* in the world—number eight [nine]* in the world. China was number—or, excuse me, we're—China was number nine [eight]* in the world; now they're number two in the world.</p>, <p>Folks, Democrats and Republicans agree we can't afford to lose this race. They came together in the Senate on an Innovation and Competition Act—that Dick was very much a part of—to help us grow the industries that win the jobs of the future. We need to lay the foundation for the next generation of American jobs and American leadership in manufacturing and technology.</p>, <p>We're going to invest in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other minority-serving institutions, because while these schools may not have the endowments or the labs needed to generate these jobs, these students are just as capable of learning about all of the things that are going to provide the jobs of the future.</p>, <p>And of course, no challenge is as urgent as climate change. Last week, I met with eight Governors for a better part of an hour, all from the Western States, Republicans and Democrats. They're facing extreme heat, record drought, and a fire season that threatens to be much longer and more dangerous and more destructive than ever.</p>, <p>Last year, for example, more than 10 million acres burned in the West—10 million acres—not counting the lives lost and homes lost. More land than exists in my home State of Delaware and my neighboring State of Maryland combined. So if a fire swept through and took out every single thing in the State of Delaware and Maryland. The drought conditions, this year, are twice as bad. You've seen the pictures. Reservoirs that are 40 feet down, 50 feet down.</p>, <p>The extreme weather isn't just in the West. In Illinois, farmers downstate are dealing with more frequent droughts. And 2 weeks ago, just south of here, you just had a nearly unprecedented tornado. We can't wait any longer to deal with climate crisis. We see it with our own eyes, and it's time to act.</p>, <p>The bipartisan agreement we reached makes some major strides. It's going to allow the transition of thousands of old, for example, of diesel school buses and buses—city buses. We're going to change them to electric buses. There are roughly a half a million of these iconic yellow school buses on the road today. Ninety-five percent of them run on diesel, for example. And diesel pollutes the air and is linked to asthma and other health problems, and it hurts our communities, and it causes our students to miss school.</p>, <p>I'll put Americans to work capping tens of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells that are leaking methane. It's devastating. And the wages to fill these—cap these wells are the same wages that it took to dig the wells, making people earn—be able to earn a prevailing wage to do it. There's thousands of them.</p>, <p>But we need to go further. I want to provide tax cuts for businesses and consumers who invest in clean energy technologies like renewables, battery storage, next-generation aviation fuels, electric vehicles. I want to set the clean electricity standard that moves us to a fully clean and reliable grid.</p>, <p>These steps are going to create good-paying union jobs and spur demand for domestic manufacturing, accelerating clean energy and clean cars, growing our capacity to build those technologies on factory floors with union workers, here in the United States.</p>, <p>And we create a new generation of jobs in clean energy and manufacturing. And I also want to enlist a new generation of climate, conservation, and reliance workers—excuse me, resilience workers—like FDR did when the American work plan—preserving our landscape with a Civilian Conservation Corps. It's a similar thing.</p>, <p>We can put Americans to work strengthening public lands and waters and making our communities—rural and urban—more resilient against extreme weather. And we can take on the long-overdue work of advancing environmental justice by addressing pollution.</p>, <p>My plan is also going to give grants to spur innovative policies and land projects—excuse me, local projects, like installing community solar and storage and disadvantage—in disadvantaged communities; replacing streetlights that are made in America with LED bulbs that cost a whole lot less and last a whole lot longer; making upgrades in homes and schools and community centers to boost energy efficiency and cut electric bills.</p>, <p>Folks, I've laid out a lot of plans here, but that's because it's time, and we have to think bigger, and we have to act bolder, and we have to build back better. When we passed the American Rescue Plan, the naysayers and the doubters said it wouldn't work. Well, we've created over 3 million jobs since I took office, more jobs in the first months of a Presidential administration than any time in American history.</p>, <p>And last week, the Congressional Budget Office doubled their projections of the 2021 economic growth from 3.2 percent to 7.4 percent, and the OECD thinks it could be higher. That puts the American Rescue Plan—and our work is going to move forward to do a lot of things, including—we're close to defeating the virus.</p>, <p>The last time energy—the economy grew at this rate was in 1984 and Ronald Reagan was telling us it was an American morning. Well, this is going to be an American century. With my American Families Plan and the other elements of the Build Back Better agenda, experts and Wall Street analysts have said that we'll create millions of good-paying jobs for years and decades to come, not just in the near term.</p>, <p>So I'm going to be making the case to the American people until the job is done, until we bring this bipartisan deal home, until we meet the needs of families today and the economy of tomorrow. And we can pay for it.</p>, <p>Let me give you a rough example. This isn't—you know, and by the way, the American—the plan for infrastructure is paid for. It's paid for. And this plan that I'm talking about—which is really expensive if you add it all up—well, guess what? The fact is that it's paid for as well. And let me tell you how we're going to pay for it.</p>, <p>Some of the ways to pay for the rest of it is: The last couple of years, for example, 55 of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars did not pay a single penny in taxes, not one single cent. Well, I don't want to punish anybody, but everybody—and I hope someday my grandchildren grow up to be billionaires. That'd be wonderful, especially for a guy who for 36 years was listed as the poorest man in United States Congress. [<i>Laughter</i>]</p>, <p>But having said that, all kidding aside, everybody has to pay their fair share. I'm not trying to gouge anybody, but, I mean, just get in the game. If we put in place a minimum 15-percent tax on the profits of corporations, the ones that didn't pay any tax, that would raise a quarter of a trillion dollars, $240 billion.</p>, <p>But there's a loophole in the system called ""stepped-up basis."" That loophole goes: If I made a capital gains and I was a wealthy person, and I was going to cash in my stock, and I was going to have to pay a tax, I was going to make, you know, $400,000, and I was going to pay x amount of taxes—if, on the way to cash it in I get hit by a truck, God forbid, and died, and it was left to my daughter, there would be no tax paid. It's not an inheritance tax. It was a tax due 10 seconds earlier.</p>, <p>If we closed that loophole, and that saves us $400 billion a year—not a year—$400 billion over this period, which is enough to pay for the child—childcare tax credit. If we end tax breaks for fossil fuels, and make polluters pay to clean up the messes they've made, that would raise $90 billion. We're not asking them to do anything that is unfair; we're just not going to subsidize them anymore. They're doing well, thank you. And the messes they made, they should clean up.</p>, <p>Well, if we ask the top 1 percent—and I hope many of you are in the top 1 percent—[<i>laughter</i>]. Maybe. [<i>Laughter</i>] You know, that tax cut that was passed in 2017 was all—it raised the deficit by over $2 trillion—not a penny paid for, and it didn't come back with anything. That—that, in fact—that entire $2 trillion—the vast majority went to the top one-tenth of 1 percent of the American people.</p>, <p>One percent—you know, if we just—1 percent—the folks in the top 1 percent, if they just paid their personal income State—tax, the same as it was under President George Bush—George W. Bush—that would generate $13 billion a year. It would raise the tax from what it is now, 35, to 39 percent. It's what it—I mean, it's not like this idea where you'd listen to the guy that used to have his job that somehow we're gouging people. The fact of the matter is, a lot of you, if you're—if you're a plumber or a teacher, you're probably paying at 25, 26 percent. Some of you would be paying higher.</p>, <p>But, here, look: It's enough to provide for—that one change—enough to provide for 2 years free community college for every student in America.</p>, <p>Now, people say that one of the purposes of taxes is to also generate growth along with making sure that we can pay for our basic needs. Well, let me ask you, what is more likely to grow the economy and enhance us: continuing the tax cut at 37 percent or spending—having to pay 39-point—and a half percent, generating economic growth? Because now you have a tax system that will allow millions of students to go to community college.</p>, <p>When I was with Barack as Vice President, he asked me to do a study. And I spent—and I—your sister, Penny Pritzker, was part of my effort to taking care of it. And the effort was simple. It came along, and we said, ""Okay, what do we""—and we needed—three hundred and, I think, forty-seven—don't hold me to the exact number—of the CEOs of the Fortune 500 companies. Said, ""What do you need most?"" You know what they said to almost—to a person? ""I need a better educated workforce."" They're not prepared to pay for it.</p>, <p>Imagine if we present the world a nation with a better educated workforce. It helps everybody. The point is, we can pay for our entire plan and make the tax system fairer for all Americans. It's about time.</p>, <p>There's a lot of work ahead of us to finish the job, but we're going to get it done. We're going to reimagine what our economy and our future could be, and show the world—just as importantly, we'll show ourselves—that democracy—democracy can deliver for the people of Illinois and the people of America, and the world can lead again.</p>, <p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I know that's a boring speech, but it's an important speech.</p>, <p>God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it.</p>, <p>And excuse my back. I apologize. I apologize. Thank you.</p>]"

16,8,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-covid-19-response-and-national-vaccination-efforts-and-exchange-with-7,"[<p><i>The President.</i> Good afternoon, everyone. I hope everyone had a safe and enjoyable Fourth of July weekend.</p>, <p>As I said in my Independence Day address to the Nation, we're closer than ever to declaring our independence from this deadly virus. Today, after receiving a briefing from my entire COVID-19 team, I'm proud to announce that we're getting even closer, because of our wartime effort, to administer 300 million shots in arms in just 150 days. More than 182 million Americans have received at least one shot, including nearly 90 percent of seniors and 70 percent of adults over the age of 27.</p>, <p>By the end of this week, we'll have reached the mark of 160 million fully vaccinated Americans. And that's a goal I set in March that I'm thrilled we're going to hit just a few days after July the Fourth. So we will have 160 million fully vaccinated Americans, up from roughly 3 million when we took office 5 months ago.</p>, <p>We see why it matters. COVID-19 cases and deaths are down by 90 percent since January. Millions of fully vaccinated Americans are getting back to—they're living their lives as they did before. Businesses are reopening and hiring and rehiring. And projected economic growth is the highest it's been—projected growth is the highest it's been in four decades.</p>, <p>And the bottom line is: The virus is on the run, and America is coming back. We're coming back together. This is one of the greatest achievements in American history, and you, the American people, made it happen.</p>, <p>But our fight against this virus is not over. Right now, as I speak to you, millions of Americans are still unvaccinated and unprotected. And because of that, their communities are at risk. Their friends are at risk. The people they care about are at risk. This is an even bigger concern because of the Delta variant.</p>, <p>In today's briefing, we discussed how the Delta variant is already responsible for half of all cases in many parts of this country. It's more easily transmissible, potentially more dangerous. And it should be—because of reconsideration and—look, let me put it another way: It seems to me that it should cause everybody to think twice. And it should cause reconsideration, especially in young people who may have thought that they didn't have to be vaccinated, didn't have to worry about it, and didn't have to do anything about it up to now.</p>, <p>But the good news is that our vaccinations are highly effective. Fully vaccinated Americans have a high degree of protection, including against this Delta variant. Study after study after study has shown that, since early May, virtually every COVID-19 hospitalization and death in the United States has been among the unvaccinated.</p>, <p>So, if you're vaccinated, you're protected. But if you're unvaccinated, you're not, and you're putting yourself—and more importantly maybe, from your perspective, your family and your friends—at risk.</p>, <p>So please get vaccinated now. It works. It's free. And it's never been easier, and it's never been more important. Do it now—for yourself and the people you care about; for your neighborhood; for your country. And I—it sounds corny, but it's a patriotic thing to do.</p>, <p>In today's briefing, we discussed how our administration is going to devote the remainder of the summer to a special focus on five ways to make gains in getting those of you who are unvaccinated, vaccinated. Because here's the deal: We are continuing to wind down the mass vaccination sites that did so much in the spring to rapidly vaccinate those eager to get their first shot—and their second shot, for that matter, if they needed a second.</p>, <p>Now we need to go to community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and oftentimes, door to door—literally knocking on doors—to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus. Look, equity, equality—it remains at the heart of our responsibility of ensuring that communities that are the hardest hit by the virus have the information and the access to get vaccinated.</p>, <p>So, as we shift from these centralized mass vaccination sites, where we were doing thousands of people a day, we're going to put even more emphasis on getting vaccinated in your community, close to home, conveniently at a location you're already familiar with.</p>, <p>First—first thing we're going to do: This includes 42,000 local pharmacies where folks with questions can talk to the pharmacist they know and already have done—dealt with. These locations overwhelmingly allow you to walk in without an appointment, get the vaccination when you're picking up your prescription or just going in to get toothpaste or something else you need from a drug store.</p>, <p>Second, my team is going to place renewed emphasis on getting the vaccines to more and more family doctors and health care providers so more Americans can get this shot at their doctor's office from the folks that they know and they trust the most.</p>, <p>Third thing we're going to do: We're going to step up efforts to get vaccines to your family doctors and other doctors who serve younger people so that adolescents ages 12 to 18 can get vaccinated and—as they go for back-to-school checkups or getting ready for their physicals they need for fall sports.</p>, <p>Fourth, we're also intensifying our efforts to meet people where they are, outside of their neighborhoods—pharmacies and doctor's offices. This includes continuing to work with employers to make vaccination shots available at work—on the work site, if possible—or—and/or give their employees paid time off to get vaccinated at a nearby facility.</p>, <p>And fifth and finally, we're sending out more mobile clinic—more mobile clinic units out there to help people with—at special events, summer festivals, sporting events, as well as places of worship, wherever we can find people gathered.</p>, <p>In addition to these initiatives to continue to vaccinate the unvaccinated, we're stepping up the—our preparations to respond to the outbreaks we're going to see among the unvaccinated. For that, we're mobilizing what I'm calling COVID-19 Surge Response teams. These teams are made up of experts from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency; CDC, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention; and elsewhere across our Government—other groups. And they're going to help States that have particular problems prevent, detect, and respond to the spread of the Delta variant among unvaccinated people in communities with low vaccination rates. And some States have very low vaccination rates.</p>, <p>They're going to be able to do—we're going to deploy things like testing to expand detection of the virus, medicines to help treat the infected, and we're going to provide Federal personnel to fill gaps in staffing, and technical experts to help investigate outbreaks—because they're going to happen in States with very low vaccination rates.</p>, <p>The bottom line is: My administration is doing everything it can to lead a whole-of-Government response at the Federal, State, and local levels to defeat the pandemic. But we need everyone to do their part. Millions of Americans have already done that. We have to keep it up though. We have to keep it up till we're finished.</p>, <p>Let me close with this: We are emerging from one of the darkest years in our Nation's history into a summer of hope and joy, hopefully. Think about where you were—where you were last year, where you are today; what you were able to do last year at this time and do today. It's a year of hard-fought progress. We can't get complacent now.</p>, <p>The best thing you can do to protect yourself and your family and the people you care about the most is get vaccinated. The best things a community can do to protect themselves is to increase vaccination rates.</p>, <p>You can do this. You can do this. Let's finish the job, finish it together.</p>, <p>Well, God bless you all. And please, please get vaccinated. It makes a big difference. As I said, it's a patriotic thing to do. May God protect our troops.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Ransomware Attack on the Kaseya Information Technology Network </i></p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, on the latest ransomware attack, can you tell us if you believe that rises to the level of U.S. retaliation?</p>, <p><i>The President.</i> I can tell you a couple things: I received an update from our national security team this morning. It appears to have caused minimal damage to U.S. businesses, but we're still gathering information to the full extent of the attack. And I'm going to have more to say about this in the next several days. We're getting more detail and information. But that's what I can tell you now. And I feel good about our ability to be able to respond.</p>, <p>Thank you.</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, what is your allowance——</p>, <p><i>Q. </i>Is Russia testing you, sir?</p>, <p><i>Q.</i> Does the incident make you think twice about——</p>]"
16,9,Joseph R. Biden,Remarks at an Independence Day Celebration,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-independence-day-celebration-11,"[<p>Today—today—we celebrate America: our freedom, our liberty, our independence. The Fourth of July is a sacred day in our country, a day of history, of hope, remembrance, and resolve, of promise and possibilities.</p>, <p>Before me stands monuments of the greatest and the goodness of our Nation, monuments of light and liberty. There's a towering memorial to George Washington, the general who led our Revolution and the President who set our Nation on its course.</p>, <p>There's a memorial to Thomas Jefferson, whose words about liberty and equality literally changed the world. And across the Tidal Basin from the Jefferson Memorial, there stands Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., his arms crossed, his eyes fixed ahead toward the promised land where equality is not only an aspiration, but a reality.</p>, <p>They helped define who we are, guide what we do, remind us of the work that history has given us in our own time. This year, the Fourth of July is a day of special celebration, for we are emerging from the darkness of years; a year of pandemic and isolation; a year of pain, fear, and heartbreaking loss. Just think back to where this Nation was a year ago. Think back to where you were a year ago. And think about how far we've come.</p>, <p>From silent streets to crowded parade routes lined with people waving American flags; from empty stadiums and arenas to fans back in their seats cheering together again; from families pressing hands against a window to grandparents hugging their grandchildren once again.</p>, <p>We're back traveling again. We're back seeing one another again. Businesses are opening and hiring again. We're seeing record job creation and record economic growth, the best in four decades and, I might add, the best in the world. Today, all across this Nation, we can say with confidence: America is coming back together.</p>, <p>Two hundred and forty-five years ago, we declared our independence from a distant king. Today, we are closer than ever to declaring our independence from a deadly virus. That's not to say the battle against COVID-19 is over. We've got a lot more work to do.</p>, <p>But just as our Declaration in 1776 was not a call to action—was a call to action, not a reason for complacency or a claim of victory—it was a call to action—the same is true today. Back then, we had the power of an idea on our side. Today, we have the power of science. Thanks to our heroic vaccine effort, we've gained the upper hand against this virus. We can live our lives, our kids can go back to school, our economy is roaring back.</p>, <p>Don't get me wrong, COVID-19 is—has not been vanquished. We all know powerful variants have emerged, like the Delta variant, but the best defense against these variants is to get vaccinated.</p>, <p>My fellow Americans, it's the most patriotic thing you can do. So, please, if you haven't gotten vaccinated, do it—do it now for yourself, for your loved ones, for your community, and for your country. You know, that's how we're going to stay ahead of these variants and protect the hard-won progress we've made. We never again want to be where we were a year ago today.</p>, <p>So, today, while the virus hasn't been vanquished, we know this: It no longer controls our lives. It no longer paralyzes our Nation. And it's within our power to make sure it never does again. And for that, we can thank the scientists and researchers, the educators, and all the other frontline and essential workers, like many of you here today, who became the light to see us through the darkness.</p>, <p>I hope you know that you, the American people, have been part of one of the most remarkable achievements in American history. But in this moment of joy, we know that this day falls hard on all those who've lost a loved one.</p>, <p>So I've told you before: Each day, I carry a card in my pocket with my schedule on it. In the back of that schedule, on that card, are the number of Americans who have lost their lives to COVID—the precise number. As of tonight, that number is 603,018 people who have lost their lives. They're husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, grandparents, friends, neighbors, coworkers.</p>, <p>And we also remember all those who lost this year—that we lost and families lost to other causes, other causes of death and cruel twists of fate. They, too, left behind loved ones unable to grieve or mourn or find closure. Each of them meant the world to someone they left behind. And those of you who've been through all this know that to heal, you have to remember. We have to remember them, and we will. We'll commit to always remember them. That's what we'll do.</p>, <p>I've long said that America is unique. Unlike every other nation on Earth, we were founded based on an idea. We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all people are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>, <p>And while we've never fully lived up to those words, we have never given up on them. They continue to animate us, and they remind us what, at our best, we as Americans believe: We, Americans, we believe in honesty and decency, in treating everyone with dignity and respect, giving everyone a fair shot, demonizing no one, giving hate no safe harbor, and leaving no one behind.</p>, <p>We lead by the power of our example, not the example of our power. And we're part of something so much bigger than ourselves. We stand as a beacon to the world. It's a code. It's a code, uniquely American code. It's who we are.</p>, <p>To all the servicemembers and your families who are here tonight, today, all of you serving around the world: It's the greatest honor to serve as your Commander in Chief. Jill and I, and our entire family, thank you for your service and sacrifice. Like so many military families thinking of their loved ones who served, we think of our son Beau today.</p>, <p>You're all part of a long chain of patriots who pledged their lives and their sacred honor in defense of this Nation and democracy around the world, for freedom and fair play, for peace and security and opportunity, for the cause of justice, for the soul of America itself.</p>, <p>But the defense of all that we love doesn't fall on your shoulders alone. It falls on all—all of us, every one of us—every American. Each day, we're reminded there's nothing guaranteed about our democracy, nothing guaranteed about our way of life. We have to fight for it, defend it, earn it.</p>, <p>Folks, it's up to all of us to protect the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; the right to equal justice under the law; the right to vote and have that vote counted; the right to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and know that our children and grandchildren will be safe on this planet for generations to come; the right to rise in the world as far as your God-given talent can take you, unlimited by barriers of privilege or power.</p>, <p>One of the great gifts of the spirit of independence—and think about this: One of the great gifts is our capacity to see ourselves whole and see ourselves honestly—what we've gotten right, what we've gotten wrong. It's a measure of the greatness of America, and we are a great nation. We don't seek to bury the wrongs. We face it, and we work to make it right.</p>, <p>You know, history tells us that when we stand together, when we unite in common cause, when we see ourselves not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans, then there's simply no limit to what we can achieve. None.</p>, <p>And today we see the results of the unity of purpose—the unity of purpose in—forging in our Nation—we're forging in our Nation, for together we're beating the virus. Together, we're breathing life into our economy. Together, we will rescue our people from division and despair. But together, we must do it. Over the past year, we've lived through some of our darkest days. Now I truly believe—I give you my word as a Biden—I truly believe we're about to see our brightest future.</p>, <p>Folks, this is a special nation, a great nation. And there is a timeless truth about America. The most powerful idea in the history of the world [beats]* in the hearts of the people of this country. It beats in all our hearts no matter your race or ethnicity; no matter your gender identity or sexual orientation; no matter your disability; no matter your faith. It beats in the hearts of rich and poor alike.</p>, <p>It unites America whether your ancestors were native to this land or brought here forcibly and enslaved; whether you were immigrants from generations back—like my family that came from Ireland—or you're coming here today looking to build a better life for your family, like our fellow Americans I just swore in, in the White House, 2 days ago.</p>, <p>The American creed—we use that phrase, ""the American creed""—is, we're all equal, created equal. It was written a long time ago. But the genius is that every generation of Americans has expanded it wider and wider to include those who were excluded before. That's why it's never gathered dust in our history books. It's still alive today: alive in our hearts; alive in the work of our hands; alive not only in the history we read, but in the history we're making.</p>, <p>My fellow Americans, now we're the guardians of that very idea of America. It's up to us to save it, to preserve it, to build on it, and I know we will. On this sacred day, I look out to those monuments on our National Mall and beyond them, into the hearts of our people across the land, and I know this: It's never, ever been a good bet to bet against America—never.</p>, <p>We just have to remember who we are: We are the United States of America, and there's nothing—nothing—we can't do if we do it together.</p>, <p>Folks, happy Fourth of July, America. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>]"
